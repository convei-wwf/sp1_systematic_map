2,"advances in satellite remote sensing, particularly active and passive microwave remote sensing, make it possible to acquire land surface characteristics on varying spatiotemporal scales that are valuable in modeling ssm over large coverage areas."
2,"for example, the advanced microwave scanning radiometer‐ earth observing system (amsr‐e; knowles et al., 2003), soil moisture and ocean salinity (smos; kerr et al., 2001), soil moisture active passive (smap; o'neill et al., 2010), and the advanced scatterometer (ascat; bartalis et al., 2007) can detect ssm values for depths of a few centimeters at 10–60 km spatial reso- lutions."
2,"the smap/sentinel‐1 active/passive soil moisture product (3 × 3 km, ease‐grid 2.0) provides esti- mates of land surface conditions retrieved by both the smap l‐band brightness temperature and the sentinel‐1 c‐band backscatter coefﬁcients."
2,"these satellites can provide spatially consistent ssm estimates, but are limited when attempting to capture detailed changes in ssm at a higher spatial resolution (e.g., 30 m) that are particularly important for most agricultural water resource applications across heterogeneous land surfaces (walker & houser, 2004)."
2,"visible, near infrared (nir), and thermal infrared (tir) remote sensing has signiﬁcant potential to estimate soil moisture with ﬁner spatial resolutions because the most frequently collected visible, nir, and tir data are available at varying spatial resolutions ranging from 30 m to 1 km."
2,"the data are available from sources such as landsat and the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reﬂection radiometer (aster) at a spatial resolution of ~100 × 100 m, and from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) data with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km."
2,"such visible, nir, and tir data provide critical information on land surface temperature (lst) and vegetation cover that are closely linked to ssm."
2,"for example, the inter- pretation of the contextual space between the lst and the normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), referred to as the triangular (carlson et al., 1994) or trapezoidal (long & singh, 2012b; moran et al., 1994) approaches, has provided straightforward and effective ways to derive ssm and evaporative fraction at ﬁner spatial resolutions."
2,"in general, satellite sensors cannot provide tir data with as much detailed spatial information as the visible and nir bands due to the nature of lower frequency and radiant energy of tir data, which limits the appli- cation of surface temperatures in practical applications (lakshmi & zehrfuhs, 2002)."
2,"to meet the demand for obtaining high‐resolution surface thermal information, some downscaling algorithms based on remote sensing data have been proposed."
2,"kustas et al. (2003) proposed the distrad algorithm that uses the relation- ship between the lst and vegetation index (vi) to achieve spatial downscaling of tir images, making it possible to produce daily ground temperatures at 100 m."
2,agam et al. (2007) improved the distrad method and proposed the tsharp algorithm based on regression analysis of the relationship between vegetation coverage and lst that can better achieve the downscaling goals.
2,"the high‐resolution urban thermal sharpener (huts) algorithm proposed by dominguez et al. (2011) is based on the determination of the relationship between the surface temperature, normalized vi, and surface albedo."
2,huts increases the spa- tial resolution of tir to be consistent with visible and nir bands and has been successfully applied to images from the airborne advanced terrestrial land applications sensor.
2,these methods are widely used to obtain promising results based mainly on single satellite sensors.
2,"it is, however, difﬁcult for single satellite sensors to capture changes in surface characteristics at both high spatial and temporal resolutions (zhu et al., 2010) due to the tradeoff between the altitude of polar orbits, swath width of imaging, and revisit time of satellites, in addition to cloud contamination."
2,"this greatly ham- pers the application of ssm values derived from visible, nir, and tir data to agricultural water resource management that requires both high spatial and temporal resolutions."
2,"data fusion approaches provide a fea- sible and economic way to maximize the advantages of multiple remote sensing data sources to reconstruct high spatiotemporal land surface dynamics (bhandari et al., 2012; gao et al., 2006; hilker et al., 2009; zhu et al., 2010)."
2,"gao et al. (2006) initially proposed the spatial and temporal adaptive reﬂectance fusion model (starfm) to reconstruct daily landsat‐scale reﬂectance and vi by combining daily modis data with 16‐day landsat images (gao et al., 2017)."
2,"furthermore, hilker et al. (2009) developed the spatial temporal adaptive algorithm for mapping reﬂectance change to resolve the transient disturbance on starfm and to improve the accuracy of synthetic landsat images for vegetated land surfaces."
2,roy et al. (2008) developed a semiphysical fusion approach to resolve the limitation of the directional dependence of reﬂectance as a function of the sun‐target‐sensor geometry and used modis brdf/albedo land bai et al.

3,"however, these methods often rely on the homogeneity of the underlying surface and have the same difﬁculty when attempting to predict the reﬂectance of heterogeneous landscapes with complex vegetation types, soil water, and meteorological con- ditions."
3,"for this reason, the enhanced starfm (estarfm) was proposed (zhu et al., 2010), to improve starfm by using the conversion coefﬁcient to enhance the accuracy of predictions in heterogeneous land- scapes, maintaining the spatial information more effectively."
3,"the starfm and estarfm algorithms were initially developed to blend shortwave reﬂectance data from modis and landsat to produce daily reﬂectance, but they have also been used to estimate thermal and eva- potranspiration (et) maps at high spatiotemporal resolutions (bai et al., 2017; cammalleri et al., 2013; l."
3,"sun et al., 2017)."
3,weng et al. (2014) modiﬁed the starfm algorithm and proposed the spatiotemporal adaptive data fusion algorithm method to generate synthetic landsat‐like daily thermal radiance and lst data by considering the annual temperature cycle.
3,they found that the prediction accuracy for the whole study area ranged from 1.3 to 2.0 k.
3,yang et al. (2016) conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the estarfm algorithm for generating aster‐like daily lsts by blending aster and modis images.
3,"the algorithm was also directly used to map daily et at ﬁeld scales and successfully achieved the data fusion products with root‐mean‐square error (rmse) ranging from 1.11 to 1.81 mm/day (bai et al., 2017; cammalleri et al., 2014)."
3,these disaggregation methods have mostly been applied for spatially downscaling and temporally enhancing reﬂectance and lst retrievals but have rarely been applied to ssm.
3,"it is known that lst largely depends on ssm and vi with its sensitivity to ssm decreasing from the bare soil surface to full vegetation cover surfaces (e.g., long & singh, 2012b; merlin et al., 2012; w."
3,"zhao et al., 2017)."
3,"therefore, scatterplots between lst and vi are typically “triangular” or “trapezoidal.”"
3,"many studies have been proposed to describe the quantitative relationship among ssm, vi, lst, and other variables, the idea of which is based on the triangular/trapezoidal feature space introduced by sandholt et al."
3,(2002).
3,"lst is a key variable to represent the thermal properties of the surface, which is a function of vi and changes with ssm."
3,"therefore, the detailed information from downscaled lst can be translated into the detailed informa- tion on ssm for each vi interval."
3,"the data fusion approach was explored in this study to generate ﬁeld‐scale (e.g., 30 × 30 m) reﬂectance/lst and resolve ssm at a ﬁner resolution."
3,"in this study, shortwave reﬂectance and tir lst maps were integrated into the huts and estarfm algo- rithms, with the aim of downscaling visible, nir, and tir remote sensing data synchronously to generate ﬁeld‐scale ssm values at a 30 × 30 m spatial resolution."
3,"speciﬁcally, the objectives of this study were to (1) produce ﬁeld‐scale reﬂectance and lst by blending landsat and modis visible, nir, and tir data jointly using huts and estarfm; (2) estimate ﬁeld‐scale ssm values based on the downscaled reﬂectance and lst using the trapezoidal approach; and (3) evaluate the performance of the downscaled lst and ssm estimates using both synchronous landsat images and in situ measurements."

19,"however, these methods are mostly based on data provided by single sensors/satellites, with spatial resolutions ranging from 30 to 1000 m, which cannot effectively generate ssm estimates of both high spatial and temporal resolutions."
19,"in this study, landsat and modis red‐nir‐lst data were integrated to provide detailed information at the 30 m spatial resolution, maximizing the potential of spatiotemporal resolution of modis and landsat data for clear‐sky days."
19,"there have been numerous studies associated with downscaling ssm by combining microwave remote sensing‐based soil moisture (e.g., amsr‐e, smap, smos, and cci) with optical remote sensing data to improve the spatial resolution of ssm estimates (peng et al., 2016), such as polynomial ﬁtting, disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (dispatch), and data assimilation."
19,"combined with visible and thermal data, the downscaled microwave remote sensing soil moisture estimates with the spatial resolution improved up to 500 m–10 km are still not able to meet the need for agricultural water management over heterogeneous land but could be more useful in large‐scale hydrological modeling."
19,"furthermore, the overall r2 (0.45, or r = 0.67) and rmse (0.038 cm3/cm3) of the downscaled ssm estimates from our study are comparable and even show further improvements compared with the published studies."
19,"more importantly, the ssm estimates from our studies are of among the highest spatial resolutions at the ﬁeld scale (30 m) over heterogeneous agricultural land."
19,the spatial representativeness of point‐based in situ ssm measurements is not ideal for the validation of downscaled soil moisture estimates at the 1 km resolution.
19,"point‐based in situ ssm measurements are more suited to validate the downscaled ssm estimates of high spatial resolution (e.g., 30 m) at the ﬁeld scale."
19,"for validation of ssm estimates from coarse‐spatial‐resolution remote sensing data (e.g., 1 km), upscaling of in situ ssm measurements to the spatial resolution of remote sensing data needs to be applied prior to the com- parison and validation of ssm estimates from coarse‐spatial‐resolution remote sensing data (x."

(2015) with rmse values from 0.03 to 0.05 cm3/cm3 at the 1,000 m scale, with errors lower than other downscaling methods for different coarse‐spatial‐resolutions."
20,error sources there are multiple error sources associated with remote sensing and meteorological data and methods for downscaling ssm at the ﬁeld scale.
20,"the estarfm method cannot accurately predict the results if there are not any short‐term, transient changes recorded in the bracketing ﬁne‐resolution images (hilker et al., 2009; zhu et al., 2010)."
20,"in different years and growth periods, the number and time interval of clear‐sky images may be different, indicating that the selection of similar pixels and weights will introduce uncertainty in the process of downscaling lst."
20,"in addition, the theoretical ndvi‐lst trapezoidal approach based on the energy balance equation depends closely on the determination of the endmembers of tsd, tvd, tsw, and tvw estimated by meteorological data of solar radiation, air temperature, and vapor pressure (long & singh, 2012a, 2012b, 2013), which may also introduce biases for the theoretical dry and wet edges and consequently ssm estimates."
20,"in addition, downscaling ssm is also affected by surface conditions and factors, such as soil evaporation pro- cesses, atmospheric conditions, precipitation, and human activities."
20,"this study combines downscaled lst estimates and the trapezoidal approach to obtain ﬁeld‐scale ssm estimates, which simpliﬁes the relationship among soil moisture, lsts, and vegetation, and would result in uncertainty in the ssm estimates."
20,"to validate the downscaled lst and ssm estimates, the observed lst and ssm at the point scale are required, which can represent an area of a few square meters and may still be incompatible with the 30 m spatial resolution of landsat data and 1 km spatial resolution of modis data."
20,"for instance, some noncultivated areas were included in the landsat and modis pixels, resulting in higher lst values than the in situ measurements and consequently lower ssm estimates as illustrated in section 3."
20,"advantages and limitations of the developed approach the downscaling method developed in this study is successfully applied to reconstruct ssm at a spatial resolution of 30 m for two heterogeneous agricultural ﬁelds in north china, where irrigation with either surface water from the yellow river in area 1 or groundwater in the ncp in area 2 plays a critical role in agricultural water management."

21,the spatial downscaling of modis data in combination with landsat data developed in this study can also be taken as temporal downscaling of landsat data by increasing observation frequency.
21,six representative dates in area 1 and three representative dates in area 2 were selected to analyze the performance of the downscaling of lst and ssm estimation with the downscaled lst.
21,"by using the downscaling method developed here, lst and ssm estimates of high spatial resolution (30 m) for other clear‐sky days can be obtained."
21,"however, because optical/tir remote sensing data are greatly affected by the atmosphere and cloud, the downscaling method still has limitations in generating spatially consistent and temporally continuous soil moisture estimates, which may not be able to meet the need for ssm monitoring in practice."
21,spatiotemporal reconstruction of modis lst data to reduce cloud contamination as exempliﬁed in zeng et al. (2018) could be a promising way to enhance the applicability of the developed ssm downscaling meth- ods.
21,"in addition, microwave l/c bands are less affected by cloud and can detect soil moisture values at 0–5 cm depths for strong penetration performance."
21,"future work will be focused on maximizing the potential of multisource data, including visible, nir, tir, and microwave remote sensing data to generate spatially consistent and temporally continuous ssm estimates at the ﬁeld scale over heterogeneous agricultural land, which would be of more value for et and crop yield estimation (y."
21,"yang et al., 2018)."
21,conclusion downscaling of lst and ssm to a 30 m spatial resolution for two heterogeneous agricultural ﬁelds in north china has been performed by jointly using the huts and estarfm algorithms and blending landsat red‐nir‐lst and modis red‐nir‐lst data in this study.
21,both downscaled lste and ssm estimates are highly consistent with the landsat lsth and ssm estimates for the same days.
21,"compared with in situ lst and ssm measurements, both downscaled lste and ssm estimates can successfully reﬂect the condi- tions within the study areas."
21,"meanwhile, there is large spatial variability in lst and ssm between different crops and land surface conditions."
21,the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows.
21,the downscaled lste was well estimated by fusion of landsat red/nir/lsth (based on the huts algo- rithm) and modis red/nir/lst data using the estarfm algorithm.
21,"the overall rmse, mae, and r2 between the downscaled lste and the landsat lsth in area 2 are 1.82 k, 1.54 k, and 0.61, respectively, which are better than those in area 1 with overall values of rmse, mae, and r2 of 1.93 k, 1.49 k, and 0.53, respectively."
21,the spatial heterogeneity of lste is more signiﬁcant in area 1 than in area 2.
21,"the sd of the downscaled lste in area 1 varies from 1.53 to 2.57 k, which is higher than values in area 2 ranging from 1.47 to 1.79 k."
21,this is mainly attributed to the complex crop patterns and irrigation schedule in area 1 that directly increase the spatial variability in lste.
21,"based on the downscaled lste and theoretical lst‐ndvi space of the trapezoidal approach, the down- scaled ssm estimates in both areas 1 and 2 are close to the landsat ssm estimates (lsth‐based) and in situ ssm measurements."
21,"the rmse values for spring maize, spring wheat, and sunﬂower in area 1 are 0.044, 0.038, and 0.026 cm3/cm3, respectively, and the mae and nrmse are within 0.034 cm3/cm3 and 19.76%."
21,"in area 2, the rmse, mae, and nrmse for winter wheat are within 0.038 cm3/cm3, 0.041 cm3/cm3, and 15.43%, respectively."
21,both the downscaled lste and ssm estimates are greatly improved for different crops in areas 1 and 2.
21,"compared with modis ssm estimates based on lst retrievals at the 1 km spatial resolution, the overall rmse (mae) of the downscaled ssm estimates decreases from 0.048 (0.039 cm3/cm3) to 0.038 cm3/cm3 (0.032 cm3/cm3), the nrmse improves from 19.13% to 14.92%, and the r2 increases from 0.15 to 0.45."
21,"this study successfully reconstructs ssm at the 30 m resolution for heterogeneous agricultural lands with irrigation, meeting the need for high‐spatial‐resolution ssm monitoring, which will beneﬁt assessment of agricultural droughts and optimization of irrigation scheduling at ﬁeld scales."
21,"future work will be focused on improving spatially consistent and temporally continuous monitoring of lst, ssm, and et of high spa- tiotemporal resolution by introducing spatiotemporal reconstruction of modis data and/or microwave remote sensing data."
