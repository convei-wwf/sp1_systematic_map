1,"the efﬁcacy available online 16 june 2012 of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the amirantes archipelago keywords: (seychelles), western indian ocean."
1,"one mapping campaign utilised compact airborne spectrographic remote sensing imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 casi landsat biological habitat classes while the other campaign used landsat 7 þ etm imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial millennium coral reef mapping project resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes."
1,"the maps were compared across a range of cramer’s v statistic characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (shannoneweiner statistic) and thematic content (cramer’s v statistic)."
1,"between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (r2 ¼ 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (r2 ¼ 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (v range 0.43 e0.93)."
1,geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the amirantes.
1,such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maxi- mizing the return on mapping investment.
