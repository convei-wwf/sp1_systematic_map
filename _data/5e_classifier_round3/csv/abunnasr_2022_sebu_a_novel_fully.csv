1,"more latent heat importantly, it would facilitate the establishment of smart cities, where human health and remote sensing wellbeing is a top priority."
1,"in this regard, several energy balance models have been proposed for landsat urban heat exchange urban areas."
1,"only recently, remote sensing images have been extensively used in these areas, but are still difficult to implement due to the large inputs’ sources and types required as well as their complexity."
1,their accuracy can also be improved.
1,"thus, in this paper, the surface energy balance model for urban areas (sebu) is proposed based on the 100-m landsat images."
1,"it uses other sources as well such as sentinel-1, modis and era5."
1,"sebu is based on the innovative hot/cold pixels approach widely known in the agricultural-based models, but also includes several dy­ namic internal calibrations."
1,it generates monthly turbulent sensible (qh) and latent (qe) heat values over a 100-m spatial resolution.
1,"when applied over seven different regions (i.e., denver, new hampshire, basel, heraklion, singapore, phoenix and vancouver) in four contrasting cli­ mates (i.e., cold, arid, warm and equatorial) and when compared to local flux tower measure­ ments, absolute mean error varied between 6.13 w m− 2 month− 1 for qe and 14.46 w m− 2 month− 1 for qh."
1,"more importantly, the novelty of sebu does not lie only in providing reliable accuracy and full reliance on the remote sensing database, but also on its open-source nature and easy-accessibility over the google earth engine (gee) platform."
1,"thus, sebu has the potential to be scalable using the massive power and huge database found in gee, where users need to specify the required date only."
1,this would certainly assist researchers to access urban cilmate information in a timely manner.
1,policy makers and even local dwellers would then benefit from their findings.
1,"furthermore, sebu can be improved to accommodate current and future needs of its users, while ultimately, enhancing the urban surface energy models and related science."
1,introduction surface energy balance models are needed to understand the energy partitioning over different land covers and land features.
1,"this is crucial to address atmospheric processes associated with local and regional meteorology (chrysoulakis et al., 2018)."
1,"more impor­ tantly, these models can play a pivotal role in retrofitting and addressing growth of existing cities, designing future cities while * corresponding author."

2,urban climate 44 (2022) 101187 reducing urban heating and improving outdoor human comfort as well as conserving natural resources under a climate change context.
2,"energy budgeting, highlighted in terms of energy income against expenditure, remains then key to understanding how landscape changes affect the overlying atmosphere."
2,the energy income over cities include the net radiation at the surface and the anthropogenic heat.
2,"this energy is transformed in form of sensible heat, evapotranspiration or latent heat, advected energy and heat storage change."
2,"the widely known equation for near surface energy budget (oke, 1988; oke and cleugh, 1987; oke et al., 2017) is as follows: q* + qf = qh + qe + δqs + δqa (1) where q* is the net all-wave radiation at the surface, qf is the anthropogenic heat flux, qh is the sensible heat flux, qe is the latent heat flux, δqs is the net change in heat storage, δqa is the net advected flux."
2,"accurate estimation of the energy budget components is needed to address cities’ micrometeorology and air quality (oke et al., 2017)."
2,"this would certainly assist in designing measures against urban warming and pollution and towards improving thermal comfort (taleghani et al., 2019)."
2,"furthermore, an accurate partitioning of the energy balance is needed to simulate the evolution of the boundary layer, and in turn, improve the performance of air quality forecasting models."
2,this would tackle the much-needed infor­ mation on the urban heat island vertical and horizontal delimitations and impacts (e.g.
2,"takebayashi and moriyama, 2007; li et al., 2019), anthropogenic heat distribution (e.g."
2,"ichinose et al., 1999; wang et al., 2018), heat waves and future climate trends (e.g."
2,"stegehuis et al., 2013; founda and santamouris, 2017; zhu et al., 2019), separation between natural heat radiation and anthropogenic heat discharge (e.g."
2,"kato and yamaguchi, 2005; zheng and weng, 2018), water conservation and irrigation best practices (e.g."
2,"moorhead et al., 2017; liu et al., 2019), and ultimately, human health, comfort and well-being (e.g."
2,"jendritzky and tinz, 2009; mcgregor and vanos, 2018)."
2,"more importantly, urban development policies as well as action and investment plans have been better monitored and prioritized (e.g., parsaee et al., 2019; oberegger et al., 2020) through the usage of multiple available models and surface energy balance approaches."
2,"in this context, several models, used as tools in urban design and planning as well as in climatic and environmental performance evaluation, have been developed and applied."
2,"the choice of the most adequate model remains related to the scale of applicability, from a few meters to thousands of kilometers, even though having an accurate and easy-to-implement model would enable better portability and comparison of the findings in different areas and contexts."
2,"some examples include surface urban energy and water balance scheme (suews) (järvi et al., 2011a, 2011b; ward et al., 2016), the integrated weather research and forecasting (wrf)/urban modelling system (chen et al., 2011), town energy balance (teb) (masson, 2000; masson et al., 2002), urban canyon model (ucm) (sakakibara, 1996), environmental meteorology model (envimet) (bruse and fleer, 1998), heat island model (him) (saitoh et al., 1996), surface energy balance model (sebm) (tso et al., 1991), and urban tethys-chloris (ut&c) (meili et al., 2020)."
2,"the listed models aim to reproduce different aspects of the urban atmosphere, where the results are used for multiple applications, including the evaluation of measures to curb urban warming."
2,"however, they vary in complexity, input requirements, output generation and methods of calculation, which makes inter-model comparison a challenge."
2,a comprehensive review is available in grimmond et al.
2,(2009).
2,"a rather recent benchmarking effort found in urban-plumber evaluates the performance of land surface models used in meteorological or climatic simulations in urban areas (best et al., 2015; lipson et al., 2020)."
2,these models require resources that are often hard to acquire.
2,they also generate results that may be difficult to interpret.
2,these two constraints have slowed the development of many of these models to become more widespread or to improve their accuracy.
2,"in addition, the complexity of atmospheric processes and lack of sufficient field data and observations further complicates this issue."
2,"as a response to this situation, an urban energy exchange model based on inputs from landsat and sentinel space imagery at 100-m res­ olution was proposed by chrysoulakis et al. (2018) to resolve the energy exchange model equation (1), with an emphasis on the synergy between sentinels 3 and 2 for surface temperature downscaling (mitraka et al., 2015, 2016)."
2,the previously mentioned chrysoulakis et al. (2018) study showed for the first time the robust earth observation (eo)-based estimation of turbulent heat fluxes in urban settings.
2,"still, the large number of required inputs, high time and resources requirement, and the integration of complex sub- models, such as direct anisotropic radiative transfer (dart) (landier et al., 2016), have posed two concerns; the first is related to its easiness of periodical implementation, or more likely the lack of it, and at different locations, while the second and more important concern, is related to questions of accuracy due to inherited biases, clearly acknowledged by authors (chrysoulakis et al., 2018)."
2,"based on the above constraints, namely the large number of required inputs, high time and resources requirement, and the inte­ gration of complex sub-models, and in order to complement already available process-based models, the surface energy balance for urban areas (sebu) model is proposed in this article."
2,"it directly addresses two primary limitations by benefiting from the widely available massive directory of satellite images and other databases found at the google earth engine (gee) platform, as well as its outstanding computational power."
2,"furthermore, it is based on the globally validated surface energy balance algorithm for land - improved (sebali/sebaligee) model, retrieving the turbulent heat fluxes as a residual of the surface energy balance equation (1), based on the inversion method technique (mhawej et al., 2020a, 2020b)."
2,"sebali/sebaligee enables mainly the assessment of monthly evapotranspiration rates over agricultural lands, much-needed for the water productivity and accounting at the basin and local scales."
2,"more importantly, sebu is a fully automated open-source model that enables the easy and prompt implementation over any urban area across the globe, without any variable required from users."
2,its main outputs include the spatially-distributed 100-m monthly turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes.
2,"in this paper, sebu is described and evaluated over seven cities (i.e., denver, new hampshire, basel, heraklion, singapore, phoenix and vancouver) with different urban characteristics in cold, arid, warm and equatorial climatic regions."
2,it is followed by a discussion on the flux footprint or source area analysis and the introduction of the gee version with its freely available source code.
2,"a spatio- temporal assessment is also made, as a proof of concept, over denver, phoenix, heraklion and singapore."

4,urban climate 44 (2022) 101187 the landsat program was first launched in 1972.
4,"it is a series of earth-observing optical satellite missions, jointly managed by nasa and the u.s."
4,geological survey.
4,"landsat images capture an image of the earth surface every 16 days, with a spatial resolution of 30-m for most of the bands."
4,"the thermal bands usually have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 60-m for landsat-7 and 100-m for landsat-8)."
4,"currently, both landsat-7 and landsat-8 are active, while the landsat-9 was only recently launched in september 2021."
4,"the importance of relying on landsat images in studies lies in providing easy access to freely available satellite images along a spatial accuracy enough for many urban applications, with the much-needed thermal bands also included."
4,"the 36-bands modis satellites span the earth twice each day, capturing an image in the morning through the terra sensor and an image in the afternoon with the aqua sensor."
4,it has a spatial resolution ranging between 250 m. and 1 km.
4,"different products are ready- to-use, compiled from the modis raw bands and are easily accessible."
4,"in this study, the modis snow cover product produced from the terra sensor, namely the mod10, is used for cloud detection as it contains a state-of-the art algorithm for differentiating between clouds and snow areas."
4,"the yearly modis land cover product, namely mcd12q1, is used for distinguishing between land cover classes."
4,the sentinel-1 satellite is the first of the copernicus programme satellite constellation launched by the esa.
4,"it is designed as a two- satellite constellation, namely sentinel-1a and sentinel-1b, launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively."
4,"two other related satellites, the sentinel-1c and 1d are under development."
4,"sentinel-1 carries an advanced radar instrument to provide a 10-m and a 6-day cycle all- weather, day-and-night imagery of the earth’s surface."
4,"it is used in this study to produce the roughness length for momentum (z0m) (zhang et al., 2017)."
4,"the era5 is the fifth generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate, corresponding to the years 1950 onwards."
4,it combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete hourly-based and consistent dataset using the laws of physics and a spatial-resolution of 10 km.
4,"it is used to generate climate-based information required in sebu, including air temperature, dewpoint, and wind speed."
4,"the elevation and slope required in the model are collected from the freely available nasa shuttle radar topographic mission (srtm) version 4, providing digital elevation data (dem) for over 80% of the globe."
4,the spatial resolution of the data is approxi­ mately 90 m.
4,"it is important to note that, part of the preprocessing which is already embedded within sebu, a simple averaged ag­ gregation was made for the satellite data that has a spatial resolution less than 100 m."

5,further description of these datasets is available in table 1.
5,urban configurations can be seen in fig.
5,the monthly-median sensible heat flux (qh) and the latent heat flux (qe) are collected from these ground-based datasets.
5,methods sebu can be divided into four main components (fig.
5,the first calculates the penman-monteith reference evapotranspiration λet based on climatic and remote sensing databases.
5,"the second component retrieves inputs (e.g., ndvi, lst, z0m) for the qh and qe assessments from the available satellite images."
5,"the third component tries to automatically identify hot/cold pixels (mhawej et al., 2020a) for a better internal calibration and more accurate qh and qe outputs."
5,"the last component adds another water-based internal calibration, producing improved qh and qe outputs."
5,"following calibrations and validations in different cities with diverse climates, 100-m qh and qe monthly images are generated."
5,the following subsections will detail each step of the method.
5,2.3.1.
5,"the penman-monteith calculation the standard food and agricultural organization (fao) method proposed by allen et al. (1989; 1998) expresses the penman- monteith reference evapotranspiration λet (penman, 1948; monteith, 1981), as follows: ( ) δ(rn − g) + ρa cp es r− aea λet = ( ) (2) δ + γ 1 + rras where rn is the net radiation [w m− 2], g is the soil heat flux [w m− 2], (es − ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit of the air [pa], ρa is the mean air density at constant pressure [kg m− 3], cp is the specific heat of the air [j kg− 1 k− 1], δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship [pa k− 1], γ is the psychrometric constant [pa k− 1], and rs and ra are the (bulk) surface and aerodynamic resistances [m s− 1]."
5,"the computation of the λet is made twice in sebu (i.e., point-based and pixel-based calculations)."
5,"the point-based flux λet as­ sessments are produced using the globally available satellite datasets, where the median values of the pixels available within the user- selected study area and the same month are considered."
5,latitude datasets are extracted from the landsat images and the elevations are based on the srtm product.
5,"the air temperature, wind speed and dewpoint are collected from the era5 datasets."
5,"the actual duration of sunshine, the last variable required in malamos et al. (2015) script, is empirically retrieved for clear conditions scenarios using solar declination at the middle of the selected month as well as the considered latitude of the study site, but added cloud coverage infor­ mation from modis satellite."
5,"as this latter provides daily satellite images of the earth skin, with an automatic identification of the cloud coverage, each cloudy pixel in each day is marked as 0, and 1 for clear conditions."
5,"the monthly mean would generate a value between 0 and 1, where values close to 1 correspond to clear conditions."
5,"a 0.23 albedo (allen et al., 1998) as well as one-value median era5 air temperature data are used in the determination of the point-based λet calculation, resembling a well-watered extensive surface of green grass of uniform height (allen et al., 1998)."
5,the pixel-based λet assessment includes changing pixel-by-pixel values for albedo and air temperature.
5,"albedo values are deduced from the atmospherically corrected level-2 different landsat images, used in tasumi et al. (2008) and mhawej et al. (2020a, 2020b), as follows: albedo = 0.254*blue+0.149*green +0.147*red +0.311*near infrared +0.103*shortwave infrared 1 +0.036*shortwave infrared 2 (3) where each band name is preceded by a weighting factor calculated from several field experiments and found in the surface energy balance model for agricultural lands (sebal) bastiaanssen et al."
5,(1998).
5,the missing apparent atmospheric transmissivity is considered null as the level-2 bottom-of-atmosphere images already included them in the calculation.

6,"spatially-distributed variables calculation modis, landsat and sentinel images are processed to acquire data after applying a cloud removal process, based on their internal quality assessment bands."
6,a monthly median is applied later for each set of data.
6,"the commonly known normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) is computed based on the following equation: red − near infrared ndvi = (4) red + near infrared where red is the third band for landsat 4, 5 and 7, it is the fourth band for landsat 8."
6,"the near infrared is band number 4 for landsat 4, 5 and 7, whereas it is band 5 for landsat 8."
6,"the land surface temperature (lst) values are calculated from the thermal bands as well as from the emissivity (ε), calculated similar to parastatidis et al. (2017), as follows: lst = tb/[ 1 + (λ*tb/ρ) lnε ] (5) [ ]2 ndvi − ndvi nonveg fvc = (6) ndvi veg − ndvi nonveg ε = εnonveg x (1 − fvc) + εveg x fvc (7) where tb is the satellite brightness temperature, λ is wavelength of emitted radiance, ρ = h * c/σ (1.438 × 10− 2 m∙k), fraction of vegetation cover (fvc) is assessed using the ndvi threshold for non-vegetated (ndvinonveg) and vegetated (ndviveg) surfaces of 0.18 and 0.85, respectively (jiménez-muñoz et al., 2008)."
6,"the reference emissivity for non-vegetated (εnonveg) and vegetated surfaces (εveg) are set to 0.97 and 0.99, respectively, as suggested by jiménez-muñoz et al."

6,"sentinel-1 dual-band cross-polarization, horizontal transmit/vertical receive (h/v) datasets are used to retrieve roughness length for momentum (z0m) (zhang et al., 2017)."
6,alos palsar and cosmo-skymed information gathered between 2006 and 2011 showed accurate roughness length estimations for the spatial and temporal analysis in urban areas.
6,"it was applied over beijing, china with a root mean square error of 0.37 m. in an area over 4 m z0m values found."
6,the retrieved equation is as follows: z0m = 12.907e0.2512σ0 (8) where σ0 is the backscattering coefficient (db) of the h/v band captured from the sentinel-1.
6,"it is followed by the calculation of the point-based friction velocity (u*), as follows (allen et al., 2005): 6"
7,abunnasr et al.
7,"urban climate 44 (2022) 101187 k*ux u* = ( ) (9) zx ln z0m where k is the von karman constant (0.41), ux is the wind speed at a known height (zx)."
7,"the 500-m modis land cover product is used to select agricultural areas, with pixels’ values of 10 (i.e., grasslands), 12 (i.e., croplands) and 14 (i.e., cropland/natural vegetation mosaics)."
7,"later, the wind speed at 200 m elevation (u200) is calculated over agricultural areas, with the assumption that at this altitude no effect from the surface roughness is available."
7,"as it is usually referred as the blending height, the applied formula is as follows: ( ) 200 ln z0m u200 = u* (10) k the pixel-based friction velocity can now be calculated as follows: ku200 u* = ( ) (11) 200 ln z0m where u200 is assumed to be constant among pixels since it is at a blending height unaffected by the surface features."
7,"the pixel-based aerodynamic resistance for heat transport (rah) is then calculated as follows: ( ) ln z2 z1 rah = (12) u**k where z1 is the height above the zero-plane displacement, z2 is some distance above the zero-plane displacement but below the height of the surface layer, and k is the von karman constant (0.41) (bastiaanssen et al., 1998)."
7,2.3.3.
7,"automatic hot/cold pixels calculation over agricultural areas the calculation of hot/cold pixels is pivotal to solve the difference in temperature between two heights (dt) which is needed for the calculation of the sensible heat flux (qh), as follows: dt qh = ρ*cp* (13) rah where ρ is the air density (kg m− 3), cp is the air specific heat (1004 j kg− 1 k− 1) and dt (k)."
7,the selection of hot and cold pixels is done over agricultural areas only.
7,"hot pixels are usually bare or uncultivated lands with limited or lack of vegetation cover along dry soil surface layer and thus, their qe (i.e., qe_hot) is assumed null."
7,"based on research by bastiaanssen et al. (1998) and others in university of idaho at kimberly (waters et al., 2000), the cold pixels, which are associated with dense vegetative cover showed qe rate about 5% larger than the penman-monteith reference evapotranspiration λet."
7,"these two assumptions of extreme pixels are as well the backbone of several widely validated agricultural-based surface energy balance (seb) models, including sebal (bastiaanssen et al., 1998), sebali (mhawej et al., 2020a), mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration (metric) (allen et al., 2007), simplified-surface energy balance index (s-sebi) (roerink et al., 2000), and et-watch (wu et al., 2008)."
7,"still, it is important to note that further internal calibrations are made by sebu, discussed in the later sections, which render biases from selecting hot/cold pixels minimal."
7,"a first internal calibration is made by the automatic and dynamic calculation of the hot/cold pixels based on mhawej et al. (2020a, 2020b) and allam et al."
7,(2021).
7,other calibrations are highlighted in section 2.3.4.
7,the automatic and dynamic calculation of the hot/ cold pixels is made through a tree-like classification followed by a statistical analysis for the whole study area.
7,the ndvi index can be used to identify pixels covered with vegetation.
7,"the potential hot pixels are in areas where ndvi is between 0 and 0.2, marking a limited or the lack of vegetation cover, whereas the potential cold pixels are in regions where ndvi is larger than 0.2."
7,"temperature thresholds for both types of pixels are identified (i.e., mean air temperature of the potential hot pixels added to half of their standard deviation for the hot threshold, and mean air temperature of the potential cold pixels added to twice of their standard deviation for the cold threshold)."
7,"these threshold values are based on mhawej et al. (2020a, 2020b); mhawej and faour (2020) and mhawej et al. (2021) and are computed based on trials and errors in hundreds of sebali/sebaligee applications across the globe."
7,"based on the retrieved temperatures and ndvi thresholds, the hot and cold pixels can be identified."
7,"based on equation (13), the horizontal dt_hot and dt_cold can now be estimated as follows: dt hot = q* × rah hot/(ρhot × cp) (14) dt cold = (q* − 1.05 × λet) × rah cold/(ρcold × cp) (15) where dt_hot and dt_cold are the difference in temperature (k) between two heights for the hot and cold pixels, respectively, rah_hot and rah_cold are the aerodynamic resistance for heat transport (m) for the hot and cold pixels, ρhot and ρcold are the air density (kg 7"

8,"urban climate 44 (2022) 101187 m− 3) for the hot and cold pixels, and cp is the air specific heat (1004 j kg− 1 k− 1)."
8,kindly note that qh_hot and qh_cold based on the equation (13) are already replaced by their respective values according to the two assumptions made earlier where qh_hot = q* and qh_cold = q* - 1.05 x λet.
8,a plotting is then made between dt_hot and dt_cold and their corresponding lst values over both regions to enable the retrieval of the pixel-based dt based on the available lst data (fig.
8,"this is based on the fact that a correlation was found to exist between dt and lst, not available when trying to correlate air temperatures and lst due to different earth features and land cover and use types (bastiaanssen et al., 1998)."
8,"this plotting approach is also used by several seb models including sebal, sebali, metric, and s-sebi, among many others."
8,"based on the correlation above, a new pixel-based spatially-distributed dt can be produced, where dt values at pixels other than the hot/cold pixels are based on a linear relationship scaled to lst values."
8,this enabled the calculation of the qh_satellite.
8,2.3.4.
8,"internal calibrations and qe and qh calculations the dynamic internal calibrations of the satellite-based qe and qh are similar to what is produced in mhawej et al. (2020a, 2020b) and allam et al."
8,(2021).
8,"these calibrations are based on the hypothesis that over water bodies, qh is minimum and qe is maximum."
8,"more importantly, transpiration is null and thus, the evapotranspiration is equal to the evaporation."
8,"the applied formula is as follows: e = p x ep (16) where e denotes evaporation rate, ep is pan evaporation and p is the pan coefficient based on fao irrigation and drainage paper no."
8,"24 (doorenbos and pruitt, 1977)."
8,this latter is varying with a changing wind speed and relative humidity conditions.
8,"based on the above, the sensible heat exchange over water is calculated and then compared to the generated value from the system (i.e., qh_satellite); the lowest sensible heat among these two are selected, and new qh_satellite values will be adjusted accordingly."
8,"the new qh_satellite will be used to compute qe_satellite values, as follows: qesatellite = q* + qf − qh satellite − δqs − δqa − s (17) where q* is the net all-wave radiation at the surface, qf is the anthropogenic heat, qh is the sensible heat flux, qe is the latent heat flux, δqs is the net heat storage, δqa is the net advected flux, s is all other sources and sinks of energy."
8,"here, we assume that over water bodies qf and δqs are zero, moreover, δqa and s are set to zero due the monthly assessment scale in sebu."
8,"the equation (17) is used to retrieve the evaporative fraction (ef) or the latent heat flux fraction, as follows: q* − qh ef = (18) qh the ef is multiplied by the saturation vapor pressure, the actual vapor pressure, the advection factor, and the latent heat of vaporization to assess qe_satellite."
8,"this latter is divided by the pixel-based λet in order to produce the evaporative coefficient, which would be multiplied later by high-quality flux- and point-based λet."
8,the output is an improved qe_satellite.
8,"calibrations and validations, using the 30–70 approach, are made in seven different locations, with a similar number of monthly data (n ≈ 35) in each climatic zone (c.f. section 2.2.2) over a 500-m buffered region around the flux towers, with this choice explained in section 3.1."
8,"the total monthly qe and qh values taken into consideration are 200 records, with others eliminated due to some data lacking from the flux towers or from satellite images due to cloudy conditions."
8,"monthly root mean square error (rmse), absolute mean error (ame) and the r-squared correlation between sebu monthly qe and qh outputs and flux towers’ datasets are performed."

9,flux footprint versus buffered area a direct comparison between sebu outputs based on 500-m buffered area and the average three-year flux footprint over heraklion was made (fig.
9,"the flux footprint was based on the kormann and meixner (2001) approach, as documented by stagakis et al."
9,(2019).
9,it uses the relative weighting of surfaces contributing to turbulent fluxes observed at a single point and over a specific time.
9,"in other terms, the flux footprint is the surface area including the sources and sinks that contribute to the vertical flux measured at the sensor platform (velasco and roth, 2010)."
9,"the required parameters are the measurement height (z), the aerodynamic parameters zero plane displacement height (zd) and roughness length for momentum (z0m), and the standard deviation of the crosswind component of the mean wind (σ v), the obukhov length (l), friction velocity (u*) and wind direction (θ)."
9,"a high correlation is found between monthly qe and qh outputs from both sets of boundaries (i.e., flux footprint and buffered area) and at the same time frame, with ~98.4% and ~ 99.9% respectively."
9,their respective rsme and ame are between ~1.51 and ~ 0.56 w m− 2 month− 1 (fig. 6 and table 2).
9,"initial calibration of sebu outputs as the 500-m buffered area provides the required source area for the calibration/validation process, the initial generation of the different qe and qh in different cities worldwide is made (table 3)."
9,"to further reduce biases, calibrations of qe and qh sebu outputs are made based on the initial findings over the 500-m buffered area and compared to the flux tower measurements."
9,"the best fit equations based on the correlation between these two datasets is then identified, having the largest r-squared values and the lowest rsme and ame."
9,more discussion about the usage of the 500-m buffered area is found in the discussion section.
9,the calibration equation found based on the seven flux towers datasets are as follows: qe′ = − 0.0059qe2 + 0.802qe + 15.878 (19) where qe’ is the new adjusted qe and qe is the value of qe generated initially from sebu.
9,qh′ = 1.4097qh + 13.681 (20) where qh’ is the new adjusted qh and qh is the value of qh generated initially from sebu.

11,"more importantly, it had shown the largest qh values among the considered cities with values soaring at 102 w m− 2 month− 1 in august 2019."
11,"either way, in these three cities, months between april and september illustrated the highest qh values."
11,"singapore remained unique, with qh monthly values between 62 and 76 w m− 2 month− 1 throughout the year."
11,discussion 4.1.
11,"flux footprint versus buffered area the straightforward kormann and meixner (2001) analytical flux footprint model was already computed over heraklion in the previous urbanfluxes project (i.e., http://urbanfluxes.eu/)."
11,"a comparison between this latter and a 500-m buffered-region over the heraklion flux tower showed very comparable results with an ame of 0.67 w m− 2 month− 1, averaged between qe and qh values."
11,"this finding is probably related to the complexity of urban areas, and where measurements should include all available sources and sinks, including traffic intersections, factories or urban parks (velasco and roth, 2010)."
11,"for instance, järvi et al. (2018) compared two eddy covariance flux measurements over the same urban area (i.e., helsinki, finland) showing random and systematic uncertainties, with the momentum and measured scalar fluxes respond very differently to the distortion caused even by the different building structure."
12,abunnasr et al.
12,urban climate 44 (2022) 101187 fig.
12,"sections over, anti-clockwise, denver, phoenix, singapore and heraklion, for further annual qe and qh spatial assessments. critical review was already included in vesala et al. (2008) of each of the used flux footprint determination approach, from a simple and constant multiplier (i.e., 100 to 300 times the effective measurements height) to lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion, large- eddy and ensemble-averaged closure models."
12,"still, no footprint model has been widely developed for urban areas (velasco and roth, 2010; velasco et al., 2013), where the existent models usually require stationarity and horizontal homogeneity of the surface for a reliable interpretation (kljun et al., 2015)."
12,"recently, more regionally-based complex models are providing better footprint areas (e.g., auvinen et al., 2017; järvi et al., 2018), but at a much higher cost in terms of input data and computation effort."
12,"furthermore, the flux footprint over singapore can be considered homogenous (velasco and roth, 2010) as only a small flux difference was noticed as a function of upwind direction (velasco et al., 2013)."
12,"as a result, and based on the above, sebu was calibrated and validated over the 500-m buffered region, particularly where monthly outputs, not instantaneous, are generated."
12,"thus, many of the required instanta­ neous parameters for the footprint models become less relevant."
12,"sebu outputs’ assessments unfortunately, no comparable spatial or temporal resolutions urban seb models are available to our knowledge."
12,"this is due to the fact that efforts to produce satellite-based urban seb has re-started only in the last five years with the project urbanfluxes (i.e., http://urbanfluxes.eu/)."
12,"their products highlighted in chrysoulakis et al. (2018) obtained a qe ame of 13.9 w m− 2 and a qh ame of 41.2 w m− 2 when applied over london, basel and heraklion."
12,"sebu qe and qh ame values were 6.13 and 14.46 w m− 2, respectively."
12,"with these promising outputs, sebu can be applied in different climates across the globe."
12,this can be done easily with its migration into the large directory and massive computation power of the gee platform.
12,"furthermore, sebu is implemented as a proof of concept in four different cities, each having its characteristic climate (i.e., cold 12"

13,a comparison between these cities is made.
13,"it showed that the cold-climate denver city has the lowest annual qe values, followed by the arid phoenix city."
13,"understandably, the highest qe values are located over vegetated surfaces, and more precisely over trees, where they exert the highest 13"

14,"contrary, over these same regions, qh values the lowest due to the cooling effect of transpiration."
14,more in-depth analysis can be made to investigate the diverse qh and qe values over different land cover and use types.
14,"still, over the whole urban agglomeration, denver, phoenix and heraklion showed similar and expected concave-shape monthly trends, where values are high between april and september."
14,the monthly change of values is characteristic for each city.
14,"singapore seemed unique, similar to other tropical cities (velasco et al., 2013), with somehow steady qe and qh values across the year."
14,"these outputs are in fact in close relation with the penman-monteith reference evapotranspiration λet monthly values in each city, as sebu is already based on."
14,"sebu strength, limitations and future potential sebu is producing 100-m monthly-based qe and qh information."
14,to our knowledge limited previous studies were able to arrive at this spatial scale.
14,"this is done due to the usage of the remote sensing-based landsat satellite datasets, providing an image of the earth every 16-days and since the 1980’s."
14,"more importantly, it is based on the widely validated sebali/sebaligee model (mhawej et al., 2020a), requiring a reduced number of inputs."
14,"furthermore, with its migration to the on-the-cloud gee platform, needed inputs by users are further reduced to the selection of month, year and the study area only, in any region across the globe."
14,"thus, any interested party, from principal investigators to researchers shall have access to monthly 100-m qe and qh data within a few seconds and over any device with internet browsing capacity (e.g., mobile, laptop, desktop)."
14,the transitioning towards the gee platform is pivotal for three main aspects; the first is the easiness of accessibility to the seb required datasets; the second is related to the future calibration 14

15,"to conclude, sebu main advantages over other seb models are related to its user-friendly and open-access nature along with improvements in the spatial and temporal accuracy and its scalability."
15,"here, it should be noted the limitations of using satellite images over urban areas."
15,"more particularly, retrieving steady images above these areas is not always granted."
15,"this is related to the capability of the sensors used as well as the existent atmospheric interactions at the satellite overpass time (voogt and oke, 2003)."
15,"another limitation of using satellite images over urban regions concerns the dif­ ficulty of viewing a significant portion of urban surfaces due to the three-dimensional structure of urban space (mirzaei and haghighat, 2010)."
15,"this urban anisotropy means that walls, streets and roofs cannot be registered due to the viewing angles and canyon structures of a city (soux et al., 2004)."
15,"to overcome these limitations, many models were and are being developed (marconcini et al., 2017)."
15,"furthermore, better climate datasets are required to reflect the spatial heterogeneity of urban micro meteorological elements."
15,the usage of ground-based meteorological stations is always an option but would require further calibrations and validations.
15,"of course, having better spatial resolution modelled climatic data, such as found in nikoloudakis et al. (2020), would improve the accuracies of sebu even further."
16,abunnasr et al.
16,"urban climate 44 (2022) 101187 even though modis daily product was used to compute the cloud coverage, modis overpass time does not exceed twice daily."
16,sebu can be improved by including other cloud datasets such as ground-based measurements from local weather stations or to directly derive net radiation from reanalysis products such as the hourly era5-land.
16,albedo values need to be adjusted to the level-2 landsat images as well as accounting for the surface anisotropy.
16,"this requires a stand-alone study, as it was produced in shuai et al. (2011) and franch et al."
16,(2014).
16,the used emissivity approach (eq. 7) needs to be improved to accommodate the urban 3d materials.
16,"this can be done using modis/terra land surface temperature and emissivity products (mod11a1), aster global emissivity database (aster-ged) products, or an improved ndvi-based emissivity method such as found in carlson and ripley (1997) and parastatidis et al."
16,(2017).
16,"if the integration of the 10-m sentinel-2 images is an option, the weighting factors for the different bands used to estimate albedo need to be computed from scratch, as it was not accurately produced previously (allam et al., 2021)."
16,"on the other hand, the low-spatial high-temporal modis brdf/albedo product (i.e., mcd43) can be used as an alternative for a regional-based study (chrysoulakis et al., 2019)."
16,the respective application can be found over http://rslab.gr/albedo.html.
16,"also, z0m is calculated based on the sentinel-1 satellite."
16,"thus, sebu would not be able to calculate z0m for dates prior to april 2014."
16,"this can be fixed by including an already-produced z0m layer for the required city before 2014 or conduct a study, even regional one, to retrieve z0m in urban areas based on the landsat, modis or avhrr optical sensors."
16,"globally available radar satellites such as smap and smos usually have very coarse spatial resolution, but other geostationary radar datasets can be used when available."
16,"more sophisticated data imputation processes, particularly over cloudy pixels, can be addressed as well and included within sebu."
16,"this can be resolved, for instance, by merging information collected from different satellites or from the same satellite but at a different date."
16,"but more importantly, anthropogenic heat needs to be calculated as it is directly related to the urban heat island mitigation initiatives, affecting human health and well-being."
16,"lastly, as none of the previous seb models was particularly built for water bodies (e.g., lakes and ponds), due to the water- atmosphere interaction complexity, a particular attention should be made in that direction to have a more comprehensive over­ view on the urban heat exchange and how to reduce its impact vis-à-vis the pressing climate change."
16,"conclusion using remote sensing images are pivotal for the future smart cities’ degin, as they save on time, personnel and resources, with only limited traditional field campaigns required (ghoussein et al., 2018)."
16,the ability to access any region across the globe would clearly advance our understanding of our surroundings.
16,"the remote sensing technique coupled with the gee platform has enabled to push the boundary even further, with prompt fetching of information and a computation of the outputs within a few seconds only."
16,"sebu is proposed, benefitting from both the remote sensing satellite images and the gee platform."
16,it provides 100-m monthly qe and qh images in different climates across the globe.
16,it is validated in seven locations with different climates according to the koppen classification.
16,qe and qh accuracies are promising.
16,this is related to the inclusion of the hot/cold pixel approach as well as the ex­ istence of several internal and dynamic calibrations.
16,"thus, sebu can be implemented and used by any interested user, to revise current policies, plan for future ones and adjust our goals for better, smart and sustainable future cities."
