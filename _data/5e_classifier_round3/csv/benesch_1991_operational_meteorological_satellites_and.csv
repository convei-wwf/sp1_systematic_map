1,a new system for the reception of high resolution digital data from meteosat and noaa was installed in 1988.
1,"after a description of the present global meteorological satellite system and the planning for future systems, information is given on the utilization of satellite data: meteosat images are used for weather monitoring and very short range forecasts."
1,in two examples the capability of the imagery is demonstrated to monitor the weather activity of atmospheric fronts and the development of cyclonic storms.
1,another section deals with the usage of quantitative data such as seasurface temperatures or atmospheric vertical temperature profiles in numerical weather forecasting.
1,"satellite data are used even in climatological, agricultural-meteorological and environmental studies."
1,satellite data have become an indispensable tool for the legal tasks of meteorological services.
1,furthermore they have an enormous benefit even for other sciences than operational meteorology.
1,introduction followed by statements on the satellite data utililization by the dwd.

4,cloud height can be derived from images in the final decisions will have to be taken soon. thermal infrared range of the solar spectrum (ir).
4,"they the meteosat second generation (msg) will provide information on cloud top temperatures, and on provide continuity to the present meteosat programme this basis on the cloud top level."
4,in addition ir images with improved performances.
4,m s g will be a series of spin- have the great advantage to be independent from the solar stabilized satellites.
4,there will be an imaging mission with illumination of the earth thus they are available during day multispectral channels very similar to the avhrr and night. instrument on board of the noaa satellites completed by the so-called water vapor images provide information some additional channels for the determination of water on the humidity content in the upper troposphere.
4,"their vapor content, exact cloud top height, tropopause height special merit is that conclusions can be drawn about the and lower atmospheric instability monitoring."
4,"horizontal horizontal and vertical transport of different air masses resolution will be 3 km at sub-satellite point, repetition even in regions without clouds."
4,the 3.7 pm channel of the rate will be 15 minutes.

4,furthermore the 3.7 om channel 1998.
4,"the provision of 3 to 4 satellites is envisaged in order data are useful in discriminating snow, ice and clouds. to cover a period of about 12 years by means of this information on the interpretation of satellite images can programme. be found for example in fett, 1977 or noaa, 1988."
4,the most important information content in satellite 2.2.2 polar orbiting satellites images concerns cloudiness.
4,a cooling of the air below the dewpoint is necessary for the generation of clouds.
4,that an improvement in the sounding mission on board of can be achieved by the withdrawal of heat by diabatic the noaa satellites will take place from about 1993/94 processes like outgoing radiation or by adiabatic expansion onwards when the advanced microwave sounding units like lifting of the air.
4,the former process leads e.g. to the (amsu) will be available.
4,"these instruments will provide formation of fog, low stratus or layers of stratocumulus. atmospheric vertical temperature and moisture profiles the lifting of air works in different scales."
4,due to heat even from cloudy areas. transfer from the ground convection is released producing from about 1997 onwards the usa intend to provide cumuliform clouds which eventually grow into large operational meteorological satellites in polar orbit only in convective complexes and clusters.
4,persistent clouds can the afternoon orbit.
4,the continuity of a meteorological often be found at the upslope side of mountains. mission in the morning orbit should be ensured by europe.
4,but most important for the weather is the lifting of air hence eumetsat has initiated actions in order to study in larger areas leading to the formation of extensive and possibilities for such a programme.
4,one option under deep cloud masses with precipitation.
4,such an ascent is consideration is to embark the instruments for operational caused in areas with the advection of warm air and / or meteorology on the first polar orbiting earth observation cyclonic vorticity whereas vertical velocity is considerably platform of esa.
4,"this is planned to be a multidisciplinary increased by the release of latent heat after condensation. platform with a payload capacity of 1.7 tonnes, nominally to not seldom the vertical motions are organized in be launched in 1997. circulatory form with band-like areas of ascent and descent other satellites as the european remote sensing side by side satellites (ers) of esa or national research projects are of in order to apply this knowledge to the interpretation interest for meteorological services."
4,"however, they will not of the imagery a continuous comparison with conventional be considered here as they are experimental missions analyses of the fields of pressure, temperature and wind at without guarantee for continuity. the surface and in upper levels is a prerequisite."
4,"doing so, a complete diagnosis of the present state of the atmosphere 3."
4,utilization of satellite data at the d w d is possible allowing also conclusions on the weather development in the near future.
4,"therefore satellite images 3.1 qualitative data are an important tool not only in weather monitoring but this section will mainly deal with the presentation of also for diagnoses and even for very short range satellite images, their interpretation and their benefit for forecasting."
5,geojournal 24.1 / 1991 57 because of these reasons all regional and aerodrome offices of the dwd are equipped with sdus having the capability to display animation loops.
5,a lot of them even can display satellite images in colour.
5,"this facilitates the separation of information even in areas with low contrast in the satellite images, e. g. in areas with minor changes of the weather activity."
5,"in addition, the regional offices are supplied with specially processed images from the central office of the dwd via longwave facsimile transmissions."
5,"this processing includes the transformation to polar- stereographic projection, count to temperature calibration of ir images, sun zenith angel corrections in vis images and special contrast enhancements."
5,as already mentioned information derived from satellite images are considered in the analysis of weather charts thus contributing to monitoring and forecasting of large scale as well as regional and local weather situations.
5,satellite information is also considered in the production of forecast charts of significant weather events for aviation purposes (dwd has to produce those charts for all areas between europe and the far east).
5,naturally satellite information is used also in ship routing consultations.
5,"fig 2 ir-images of meteosat-3 from 22.02.1989, 00, 11and 23 utc with surface front and isobars information are provided to customers by telephone as advices, by written text overviews and as warnings of severe weather."
5,"especially for nautical and aviation purposes the images of neighboured geostationary due to the high freguency of their images satellites are very helpful, and mainly the information on geostationary satellites are especially suitable for this typhoons and hurricans."
5,finally it should be mentioned purpose.
5,they allow the production of animation loops that the dwd provides satellite images to the press and from consecutive images.
5,"with them it is easy to determine tv agencies for information of the public on the actual the direction and speed of drifting cloud systems and to weather situation. observe changes in the weather activity by monitoring 3.1.2 synoptical case studies"" changes of the cloudiness, e. g. increase of the area covered by clouds or of the cloud top level or decay with time of meteosat images allow a direct observation of the well developed cloud structures. cloud distribution in the vicinity to the typical synoptic"

8,"the position of low and high pressure atmosphere is simulated and prognosticated by applying systems at the surface, of upper troughs and ridges, mathematical-physical equations on atmospheric variables vorticity centers and jet streams can be inferred from and parameters."
8,sometimes however numerical analyses characteristic cloud patterns.
8,often fast changes in the are not correct mainly because of the lack of measured cloud distribution occur indicating changes of the intensity atmospheric data or observational data especially over the of the synoptic structures. oceans.
8,such deviations of computed analyses from the in the following two examples are given.

8,for example cloudy areas in satellite images image reveal at the beginning only widespread low clouds should be correlated with high values of relative humidity exist at the front with some poorly organized patches of in numerical analyses.
8,if this is not the case the numerical higher clouds further upstream.
8,therefore the weather analysis is not perfect with the consequence that the activity of the front is weak.
8,but in the course of the day a numerical forecast basing on this analysis will not be the band of higher clouds suddenly appears above the surface best one. front and behind of it with widespread rain.
8,this significant at the dwd satellite images are not only used for change could be detected only by means of the satellite monitoring the quality of numerical analyses but even for imagery over the data sparse area of the e atlantic.
8,the forecasts.
8,"if at the beginning the correspondence between change had its origin in an increase of the temperature numerical analysis fields and satellite information was contrast at the front moving eastward due to the good, but some hours later a discrepancy occurs between confluence of the warm air ahead and the cold air behind of numerical forecast fields and satellite images, we may the front."
8,"such a ""frontogenesis"" is connected with a assume that the computer simulation was not perfect. circulation transverse to the front with lifting of the conclusions from such monitoring results are reported to warmer air and descending of the colder air."
8,"clouds form in regional offices either as warning advices or by text the area of ascent orientated more or less parallel to the information with indications on the probably further front, when the moisture in the warm air is sufficiently weather development within the next few hours."
8,an high.
8,"at the same time a wind speed maximum, a so-called example of a satellite image superimposed with computed ""jet-streak"", develops in the upper troposphere at the outer humidity fields is shown in fig 4."
8,note the relatively good edge of the highest clouds. correspondene over the mediterranean sea and the the second example reflects the changes of the cloud discrepancy w of the s norwegian coast. distribution during the process of regeneration of a surface it is known how a numerical field should have looked low (fig 3).
8,at the beginning there is a fully developed low like when recognizing that a computer simulation is not with a vertical axis sw of iceland.
8,its frontal system perfect.
8,this can be used to make additional information extends eastwards toward the british isles. available to the numerical analysis and forecast scheme.
8,at the satellite image shows a cloud spiral around the low the dwd a method has been developed to derive vertical but scarce high level clouds over the cold front and the humidity profiles by interactively interpreting cloud warm sector.
8,these conditions changed very quickly. systems in satellite images and making them available to already 12 hours later a vertically extended cloud shield the data base for numerical analyses.
8,"this is done on a had formed over the frontal system and rainfall set in. routine basis for areas over the atlantic ocean and the connected with that, the pressure began to fall and finally a north sea-areas from where only very few observational new low pressure center had developed taking over the data are available."
8,those additional data which are derived function of the old weakening center.
8,the new low from satellite data by interactive processing are called subsequently moved towards east as an intense vortex with 'bogus' data.
8,"more detailed information on this can be strong winds and severe precipitation activity. found in benesch et al., 1986."
8,"by means of this method not the regeneration of the low was physically caused by only additional information on humidity data but even on the approach of an upper trough to the surface frontal the exact position of high and low pressure systems, on system."
8,divergence ahead of the trough caused an upper air troughs and ridges and on temperature fields ascending air motion in the mid troposphere as well as a could be provided. pressure fall at the surface.
8,the divergence is indicated by other examples for a quantification of qualitative advection of cyclonic vorticity in upper levels. satellite data are mentioned here only briefly.
8,so a procedure is implemented in the satellite display system at 3.2 quantitative data the central office at offenbach to determine explicitly the 3.2.1 quantification of qualitative data speed of cloud or frontal systems.
8,this is a tool for very short time forecasting.
8,"as ir images are calibrated, it is an important usage of satellite data is the monitoring possible to determine the exact cloud top temperature and the correctness of numerical weather analyses and from that the cloud top height."
8,this is mainly needed for forecasts by means of satellite images.
8,"as it is well known, aviation purposes."

9,this model weather forecast models has been given already in the cannot be used for weather simulation over the whole section above (bogus data).
9,quantitative satellite data globe.
9,it is a nested model whose parameters at the borders being derived at international centers of satellite operators have to be provided from a global model.
9,"for numerical are more important, however."
9,those data are vertical weather forecasting over germany and europe by means of temperature and humidity profiles which are retrieved the mesoscale model the dwd consequently has to from the tovs data at a center at washington (see section operate in parallel a global model.
9,2.1.3).
9,these data are distributed worldwide to all this is necessary as meteorological events in one part of interested meteorological services via the international the earth propagate quickly around the world and meteorological telecommunication system.
9,thus the data influence the weather even at distant places within a few are available at dwd and are used operationally day by day days.
9,"for example, tropical disturbances can give rise to in the numerical analysis scheme. weather systems at much higher latitudes."

11,these are data other applications are in an early state and are far more of humidity in heights between 5 and 10 kilometers experimental than operational.
11,for example studies have calculated from the meteosat water vapor channel. been initiated to calculate evaporation by means of land these data are important because radiosonde humidity surface temperatures which are derived from a v h r r data. measurements are rather inaccurate at those cold levels ( - 20 t o - 8 0 degrees centigrade).

11,evaluation of those information is often performed by subjective 3.2.3 satellite data for climatological and environmental interpretation of satellite images.
11,thus efforts are made to studies objectify nowcasting methods.
11,a first step in this direction the dwd operates on a routine basis a method for will be an automatic classification of cloud and surface determining from satellite data the solar irradiance parameters in satellite images.
11,results will be objective available at ground level.
11,"this method was published by data on type and amount of clouds, sea and land surface m6ser etal., 1984."

12,efforts are ongoing to improve the accuracy of the temperature profiles by including avhrr data in the retrieval process.
12,the utilization of full resolution tovs data is necessary for mesoscale numerical weather forecasting as the mesoscale structure of the atmosphere can be derived only from satellite data because the horizontal distance of radiosonde measurements is too large.
12,other quantitative parameters for numerical weather forecasting and for climatological studies will be derived from avhrr data at the dwd.
12,for this purpose we have available the so-called apollo software which has been developed at the university of oxford.
12,"besides digital mapping of snow and ice, cloud classification, sea and land surface temperatures, data of the liquid water content of the atmosphere will be derived."
12,other activities concern the preparation on the availability of advanced microwave sounding instruments (amsus) which will provide vertical atmosperic temperature and humidity profiles even from areas with clouds.
