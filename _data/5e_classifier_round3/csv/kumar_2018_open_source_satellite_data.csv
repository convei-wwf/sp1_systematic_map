1,bajpai abstract the capabilities of satellite data and geographic information system (gis) to assess and monitor land resources are escalating with the technical advancements.
1,"however, the costs of these data and the gis softwares are barrier to their use by broader community, particularly in developing countries."
1,"to maximize the scientiﬁc and societal beneﬁts of the spatial data, open data and softwares are being promoted."
1,"several satellite data from different sources with a wide array of spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions are now being made available free to all categories of users."
1,"to analyze the satellite data of widely differing characteristics and other spatial and nonspatial data from different sources, rapid advancements have been observed in free/open-source software (foss) development in the ﬁeld of gis."
1,this chapter discusses the availability of open spatial data (satellite and vector) and open-source gis softwares (osgs).
1,the viability of adoption of osgs as an alternative to proprietary softwares has also been discussed.
1,"keywords open-source gis · open data · open standards · remote sensing 10.1 introduction remote sensing and gis are undeniably important methodological tools for studies related to inventory, surveying, and monitoring of natural resources (burrough 1986; singh 1989; trotter 1991; brown 2004; miller et al."
1,2013; kumar et al.
1,2015).
1,"the satellite data, with a synoptic view of the earth’s surface, submeter to kilometer spatial resolutions, and hourly to monthly temporal resolutions, has been used as a signiﬁcant information source for these studies (kumar 2013; dowman and reuter 2016)."

2,kumar et al. signiﬁcantly affect the utility of satellite data (turner et al.
2,2015).
2,data continuity relates to the maintenance of long-term satellite data products.
2,a long-term data allows tracking the causes and spatial pattern of changes in the earth’s surface features.
2,"earth observation programs, with standard imaging speciﬁcations and internationally agreed complementary satellite launches, can ensure data continuity with similar quality images."
2,"data affordability arises from the cost of the imagery, and data access addresses the ability of researchers to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and extract value from satellite imagery as well as integrate with other datasets."
2,gis has become an integral tool for these processes.
2,"it allows integration and analysis of spatial data, collected from various sources (burrough and mcdonnell 1998; worboys and duckham 2004; liu and philippa 2009; kumar 2013)."
2,"the use of gis has produced remarkable changes in the way and rate at which spatial data are generated, updated, analyzed, and disseminated, making production and analysis of geographic information very efﬁcient."
2,"however, the highly priced proprietary softwares and unavailability of public satellite data have signiﬁcant impact on their use, particularly in developing coun- tries."
2,a large number of satellites are currently orbiting the earth.
2,"the vast majority of these are relaying data to the earth, and many are equipped with high-power cameras."
2,but until recently they were available only to those who could pay for them.
2,"nowadays, much satellite earth observation data are open and available for download free of charge, especially at medium to low spatial resolution (abdi 2013; harris and baumann 2015; bakillah and liang 2016; dowman and reuter 2016; rocchini et al."
2,2017).
2,new data policies promoting free and open access to satellite imagery are expanding the use of satellite imagery (miller et al.
2,2013; turner et al.
2,2015; harris and baumann 2015; dowman and reuter 2016).
2,"a detailed study of open data policies of different organizations, which relate in one way or the other to satellite earth observation data, is presented by harris and baumann (2015)."
2,"from late 2008 when the entire archive of landsat imagery, including all new acquisitions, became available online at no cost to september 2012, 9 million scenes were downloaded, with more than 3 million scenes distributed in 2012 alone."
2,"prior to the availability of no cost imagery, the most scenes sold in 1 year totaled 25,000 (miller et al."
2,2013).
2,"the current level of use will likely increase among these users, particularly as it becomes better known that the imagery is available at no cost and as new use cases are identiﬁed."
2,"with rapid developments in the capabilities of gis tools, the use of satellite data is increasing."
2,"however, proprietary gis softwares are highly priced with additional charges for speciﬁc modules."
2,many of such licensed softwares remain unutilized in various institutes and research centers because they require either extensive training or easy availability on multiple locations.
2,these may not be compatible with all operating systems.
2,all these problems can be solved by the use of free/open-source software tools.
2,open-source (os) software is software where the source code is made available under a license that allows the modiﬁcation and redistribution of the software at will.
2,"osgis is free of cost and can be installed on multiple operating systems, such as windows, macos, and linux."
2,"several osgis software packages (grass, qgis, saga, etc.) are available and freely accessible to the users—"
3,"10 open-source satellite data and gis for land resource mapping 187 covering all sectors of geospatial data handling (desktop gis, remote sensing software, gis libraries, spatial database management system, gis servers, and web map server)—some of them having very good capabilities."
3,"the usage of these types of software is increasingly growing because of reasons such as security, open standards, vendor independence."
3,"increasing download rates of open-source gis softwares, their use cases, and ﬁnancial support by government organizations to projects on open-source gis explain their rise in popularity (steiniger and bocher 2009)."
3,this chapter discusses the availability of free satellite data and free/open- source gis softwares.
3,10.2 open satellite data free global satellite image data of spatial resolutions of 1 m to 1 km and spectral resolution and from pan to hyperspectral are available from an increasing number of sources (table 10.1).
3,here are the most important archives and other useful data: 10.2.1 coarse resolution satellite data modis (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) is an extensive program using sensors on two satellites that each provide complete daily coverage of the earth.
3,"the data have a variety of resolutions: spectral, spatial, and temporal."
3,it has 36 bands ranging from visible to thermal region.
3,the spatial resolution varies from 250 m (bands 1–2) to 500 m (bands 3–7) and 1000 m (bands 8–36).
3,"because the modis sensor is carried on both the terra and aqua satellites, it is generally possible to obtain images in the morning (terra) and the afternoon (aqua) for any particular location."
3,nighttime data are also available in the thermal range of the spectrum.
3,"these data are available freely for download from the http://earthexplorer. usgs.gov/, http://glovis.usgs.gov and http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb."
3,"while the user can order a daily scene for any speciﬁc date and location, many consolidated products have been developed with modis data."
3,"these include 8-day or 16-day composite images, a variety of indices, and a range of other global products with different time scales."
3,"products are separated into four science discipline groups, namely, land, atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere products."
3,processed modis data such as the surface reﬂectance products are normally segmented into tiles with an area of 10  10 using a sinusoidal projection.
3,the advanced very high resolution radiometer (avhrr) provides four- to six-band multispectral data from the noaa polar-orbiting satellite series.
3,"there is fairly continuous global coverage since june 1979, with morning and afternoon acquisitions available."
3,the resolution is 1.1 km at nadir.
3,the number of available bands will depend on the satellite.
3,it also provides normalized difference vegeta- tion index (ndvi) composites produced from multiple avhrr daily observations

6,"the sentinel-2 mission consists of two satellites developed to support vegetation, land cover, and environmental monitoring."
6,"the sentinel-2a satellite was launched by esa on june 23, 2015, and operates in a sun-synchronous orbit with a 10-day repeat cycle."
6,"a second identical satellite (sentinel-2b) was launched on march 7, 2017, and is expected to be operational for data acquisitions in 3–4 months."
6,"together they will cover all earth’s land surfaces, large islands, and inland and coastal waters every 5 days."
6,"the data from the sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (msi) is available to free download from october, 2015."
6,it acquires images in 13 spectral bands ranging from visible and near- infrared (vnir) to shortwave infrared (swir) wavelengths along a 290-km orbital swath.

7,"10.2.3 high-resolution satellite data policy documents and legal instruments concerning open satellite data are predom- inantly in favor of full, free of charge, and open access to data (harris and baumann 2015)."
7,"however, high-resolution satellite data have not been made open for reasons like ﬁnancial viability, proprietary interests, defense and security, national legisla- tions, etc."
7,"a limited number of scenes (only 179,981 worldwide) of orbview pan data are made available by usgs with no restrictions."
7,"10.2.4 hyperspectral satellite data hyperspectral remote sensing, also known as imaging spectroscopy, is a relatively new technology that is currently being investigated by researchers and scientists with regard to the detection and identiﬁcation of minerals, terrestrial vegetation, and man-made materials."
7,"multispectral data are acquired in a relatively small number (3–10) of spectral bands with broad spectral bandwidths (~10 nm), whereas hyperspectral data bands are numerous (10s–100s) and narrow (~10 nm)."
7,many surface materials have unique absorption and reﬂectance characteristics that are only 10–20 nm wide; the detailed reﬂectance spectrum acquired by hyperspectral remote sensing makes it possible to identify and distinguish material and conditions on the ground in ways that are impossible even with very high-resolution multispectral imagery.
7,"as of now only two satellite-based hyperspectral data are available, namely, hyperion (30 m resolution) onboard eo-1 satellite of nasa and hysi (500 m resolution) onboard ims-1 of isro."
7,"the hyperion data, which have been once purchased, are available for download freely from http://earthexplorer.usgs. gov/ and http://glovis.usgs.gov."

8,"the cartosat dem at 30 m resolution is available for download from http://bhuvan-noeda.nrsc.gov.in/download/download/download. php for india only with, some strategic area masked out."
8,the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission (srtm) has provided dems for over 80% of the globe.
8,the void ﬁlled data is distributed free of charge by usgs and is available for download.
8,"earlier, these data were available at 1 arc second (approx. 30 m resolution) and 3 arc second (approx. 90 m resolution), respectively, for isa and other countries."
8,"recently, the 1 arc second data product is made available for all countries."
8,"however, dem tiles above 50 north and below 50 south latitude are sampled at a resolution of 2 arc second by 1 arc second."
8,the vertical error of the dem is reported to be less than 16 m.
8,the data currently being distributed by nasa/usgs (ﬁnished product) contains “no-data” holes where water or heavy shadow prevented the quantiﬁcation of elevation.
8,"these are generally small holes, which nevertheless render the data less useful, especially in ﬁelds of hydrological modeling."
8,the srtm digital elevation data provided on http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ has been processed to ﬁll data voids and to facilitate its ease of use by a wide group of potential users.
8,this data is provided in an effort to promote the use of geospatial science and applications for sustainable development and resource conservation in the developing world.
8,on may 2016 the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) released the digital surface model (dsm) dataset for global terrestrial region with a horizontal resolution of approx. 30 m (1 arc sec) free of charge.
8,the dataset has been compiled using the advanced land observing satellite “daichi” (alos)—palsar’s l-band.
8,"the dataset is published based on the dsm dataset (5-m mesh version) of the “world 3d topographic data,” which is the most precise global-scale elevation data at this time, and its elevation precision is also at a world-leading level as a 30-m mesh version (http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/alos/en/aw3d30/)."

9,"if the users alter or build upon this data, the result may be distributed only under the same license."
9,"10.5 open-source gis software packages the criteria used for selecting suitable gis software include cost, standards, func- tionality, and usability (wang and wang 2001; ven et al."
9,2008; chen et al.
9,2010; fitzgerald 2011; brovelli et al.
9,2017).
9,"cost is the most important factor in selecting software packages (keil and tiwana 2006), particularly in developing countries."
9,"it includes the expenditure-associated software license, training, maintenance, soft- ware upgradation, add-on modules, and support services costs."
9,open-source soft- wares are available free including the source code and are protected under “free software licenses” to ensure the legal rights of the users and the freedoms of the software.
9,"the major free software license templates are general public license (gpl), lesser general public license (lgpl), eclipse public license (epl), mozilla public license (mpl), and berkeley software distribution (bsd), a detail of which can be found in steiniger and bocher (2009)."
9,"the availability of source code enables development and free availability of customized add-on applications and rapid identiﬁcation, reporting, and ﬁxation of bugs."
9,"for continued improve- ments, maintenance, and support, the users need not to be dependent on a single vendor or group as in case of proprietary softwares."
9,"further, for each project, global community of users and developers is available for asking questions and advice."
9,"support includes detailed documentation, forums, wikis, newsgroups, email lists, and live chat."
9,none of this costs anything except time.
9,open-source developers prefer to adhere to open standards like those of the open geospatial consortium (ogc).
9,this improves interoperability within and between open-source and proprietary software.
9,the ogc is an international not for proﬁt organization committed to making quality open standards for the global geospatial community.
9,"the members include representatives from government, commercial organizations, ngos, and academic and research organizations."
9,ogc are at the core of major infrastructures such as the european union’s inspire spatial data infra- structure (sdi) (bakillah and liang 2016).
9,"a gis project involves spatial data collection/creation, conversion, data storage, manipulation, analysis, and visualization."
9,"based on these functionalities, four major types of gis softwares are found: desktop gis, gis libraries, gis database man- agement systems, and web gis (steiniger and hunter 2013)."

12,most of these applications were believed to be used by relatively technically sophisticated users (lerner and tirole 2002; nichols and twidale 2003).
12,"however, many of these have now reached a mature stage and are being used by novice to expert users (steiniger and hay 2009)."
12,the acceptance of foss for gis depends on its usability.
12,"iso/iec 9126-1991 deﬁnes three sub-criteria of usability: understandability, learnability, and operability."
12,"the usability parameters for osgis softwares may be installation easiness, suitability for all platform, graphical user interface (gui) suitability, ability to import/export different data format, interacting with existing data (legacy integration), user support, and easy and understandable steps to do analysis."
12,"most of the matured osgis softwares (grass, saga, qgis, etc.) fulﬁll these criteria and show excellent usability."
12,descriptions and capabilities of some of the most popular and matured desktop osgis softwares are given in the following sections.
12,"10.5.1 integrated land and water information system (ilwis) ilwis, initially developed and distributed by netherlands based itc enschede (international institute for geo-information science and earth observation) for its researchers and students, is now distributed under the terms of the gpl since 2007 (http://www.itc.nl/ilwis/downloads/ilwis33.asp)."
12,"it combines raster (image analy- sis), vector, and thematic data operations in one comprehensive software program on the desktop."
12,"ilwis delivers a wide range of possibilities, including import/ export, user-friendly digitizing, editing, analysis and display of data as well as quality map composition."
12,"it also offers advanced functions like image processing, hydrological modeling, digital terrain analysis, geostatistical and statistical analysis, database, and similar operations."
12,it even allows the user to analyze stereo photo- graphs from a monitor with a stereoscope mounted on the screen.
12,the program runs only on windows.
12,"however, the ilwis versions ilwis 3.3 with the patch331.exe and ilwis 3.4 can work in linux via wine (http://www.winehq.org/), a free and open-source compatibility layer that allow programs developed for windows to run on linux."
13,10 open-source satellite data and gis for land resource mapping 197 10.5.2 geographic resources analysis support system (grass) grass is easily the oldest of the open-source gis software products.
13,"like ilwis, grass also is an open-source raster and vector program, and it is available for a variety of operating systems like windows, linux, mac, etc."
13,"grass is used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics/maps produc- tion, spatial modeling, and visualization (neteler and mitasova, 2008)."
13,"originally written as a raster analysis system, grass has had vector analysis capabilities added to it as well."
13,"grass can import a wide range of formats, using both the gdal and ogr libraries for data import."
13,grass also has the ability to directly read attribute and spatial data from postgis/ postgresql.
13,it can be coupled with r (r core team 2016) for geostatistical analysis (dasgupta et al.
13,2012; steiniger and hay 2009).
13,grass gis is an ofﬁcial project of the open source geospatial foundation (osgeo).
13,there are more than 400 modules available in the latest stable grass software release.
13,"grass is currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world, as well as by many governmental agencies and environ- mental consulting companies."
13,"neteler and mitášová (2008) and neteler et al. (2012) provide detailed information about the software capabilities, design and technical developments, and its uses."
13,"in over three decades of development, grass has become a high-quality cutting-edge gis with an almost unparalleled depth of functionalities directly within the main software package (neteler et al."
13,(2012)).
13,10.5.3 quantum gis (qgis) qgis is an ofﬁcial project of the osgeo.
13,"it is not only a desktop gis, but provides a spatial ﬁle browser, a server application, and web applications."
13,"it runs on linux, unix, mac osx, windows, and android and supports numerous vector, raster, and database formats and functionalities."
13,qgis provides a continuously growing number of capabilities provided by core functions and plugins.
13,qgis supports postgis and shapeﬁles as vector data sources.
13,"qgis uses ogr as a data import bridge, so support of all ogr formats is also available."
13,"qgis supports dem, arcgrid, erdas, sdts, and geotiff raster formats."
13,"grass and saga are strong in raster analysis and are comparable with arcinfo, but are lesser user-friendly, or fewer vector graphics drawing and editing functions."
13,qgis is the preferred visual- ization environment for grass users providing a modern user interface and map element symbology editor.
13,grass integration provides access to grass gis databases and functionalities.
13,"qgis provides tools in spatial analysis, geoprocessing, geometry, and data management with special focus on hydrological and geomorphological analysis."
13,the integration of a wms and wfs server into qgis allows a seamless crossover from desktop to the web.
13,extended functionalities can be created through plug-ins.
13,the growing number of plug-ins is being created by
14,198 n.

14,a well- elaborated training manual may be found in http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/ train ing_manual/index.html.
14,10.5.4 system for automated geoscientiﬁc analyses (saga) saga gis is specially designed for easy and effective implementation of spatial algorithms.
14,it offers very comprehensive and growing algorithms for raster applica- tions.
14,it also provides object-oriented image classiﬁcation of satellite data (kothe and bock 2006).
14,saga gis can be used together with other gis software like kosmo or qgis to get better vector data- and map-producing capabilities.
14,saga gis modules can be executed from within the statistical data analysis software r (r core team 2016) in order to integrate statistical and gis analyses.
14,"several modules also focus on dems and terrain analysis, like analytical hill shading, visibility analysis, local geomorphometry and geomorphographic classiﬁcations, terrain parameters related to hydrology, channel network and watershed basin extraction, and the creation of proﬁles and cross-sectional diagrams."
14,"except for the saga application programming interface (api) (licensed under lgpl), most saga source codes have been licensed under the gpl."
14,"10.6 conclusions the open movement, which promotes the use of open-source licenses for data and software, is gaining popularity now."
14,the cost of data and gis softwares is an important factor affecting the adoption of geospatial technologies.
14,the open data and osgs remove this barrier.
14,"however, the most important consideration for adoption of osgs is the availability of source codes which provide ﬂexibility to the users to customize it according to their need."
14,"the osgs provides more ﬂexibility to the users but requires more efforts to use, whereas, the opposite is true for proprietary software in general."
14,"however, many of the matured osgs provides equally good usability."
14,compliance to open standards and a large community of developers and users to support further adds to their usability.
