2,371 20.1 introduction environmental and meteorological added values of remote sensing (rs) data are among the most important perspectives of the application of remote sensing in drought assessment.
2,"rs products provide mature data sources for advanced land change analysis, hence, recently they have paved a valuable way to monitor droughts, especially through identifying and detecting the spatial-tempo- ral landscape changes remotely."
2,"the information is collected through various platforms including ground-based (such as surface radars or ground-based research instruments), aerospace (such as balloons, helicopters, and aircraft), and space (satellites and shuttles) bases that use sensors to col- lect electromagnetic spectrum for getting information."
2,"thanks to recent progress, a wide range of sensors are available for better decision-making and acquiring enhanced information on a range of different scales (west et al., 2019)."
2,"depending on the electromagnetic energy source, these systems may be active or passive remote sensing."
2,both remote sensing techniques are based on the fact that the ratio of the reflected electro- magnetic radiation versus transmitted or absorbed energy on a surface is varying.
2,"these changes in the characteristics of surface features may be characterized by tone, size, texture, shape, or con- trast in a specific wavelength."
2,"the amount of absorbed or radiated energy by different phenomena under drought conditions depends on a number of factors, including the distance between the source and surface, the wavelength of the radiation, passage environment, and surface characteristics."
2,"for example, the spectral reflections of wet and dry soils are clearly different."

3,"362 ﻿integrated drought management, volume 2 drought is a complex hazard in natural ecosystems that affects a variety of sectors in natural, economic, and social systems (wilhite, 2000; morgan; vicente-serrano 2016)."
3,"due to the complex- ity of drought characteristics, it demonstrates a spatiotemporal variability; for this reason, remote sensing can be a useful tool for drought monitoring."
3,"over time, our capability to deal with the com- plexities of early warning and impressive monitoring of drought conditions has improved."
3,"20.2 usefulness of remote sensing for drought monitoring recent technological progress in collecting satellite and rs data explicitly has given an opportunity to use rs data for drought assessment purposes (thenkabail and gamage, 2004; senay et al., 2015; west et al., 2019)."
3,"a close look at recent advances shows that remotely sensed data have provided a better prospect for monitoring of drought-related spatiotemporal changes and hydrological com- ponents, such as rainfall, soil moisture, groundwater, and evapotranspiration (aghakouchak et al., 2015)."
3,"on the other hand, it provides an opportunity to quantify the effects of drought, vegetation health, and observational changes in land cover."
3,"the use of meteorological measurements from ground stations for drought assessment may be challenging, as these types of data sets commonly are comprised of different record lengths and variable qualities (aghakouchak and nakhjiri, 2012; aghakouchak et al., 2015)."
3,"compared to in- ground observations, some key advantages of rs products are the reliability of collected data, their spatial coverage ,and regular daily to weekly observations (barrett et al., 1990; barrett and herschy, 1989; morgan, 1989; kogan, 1997; ahmadalipour et al., 2017)."
3,"due to high spatial and temporal coverage, rs-based products can provide real-time global information."
3,"this may provide a unique opportunity to improve water resources management (sheffield et al., 2018; aghakouchak et al., 2015)."
3,"from the perspective of the drought management cycle, rs could provide a variety of data that could be found useful for preparedness, mitigation plans, risk reduction, and crisis management (figure 20.1)."
3,"a key advantage of rs data over ground station recordings is that rs data reflect the dynamics of phenomena, such as plant phenology, biomass burning, canopy stress, and other hydro- logical dynamics in generally acceptable time and space scales (asner and alencar, 2010)."
3,"however, in practice, in many instances, both meteorological and rs data assimilation systems are used to get figure 20.1 the series of drought-related stages in relation to risk mitigation and crisis management."
4,remote sensing capabilities for observational drought assessment﻿ 363 table 20.1 rs methods compared to traditional methods remote sensing data ground-based data data collection covers a wide spatial range meteorological stations cannot be built anywhere sufficientcoverage insufficient station data low maintenance cost high maintenance cost often collected automatically needs a large personnel network periodic data collection frequent data collection data is regional or surface data is point-based and does not show regional changes most data can be analyzed visually data is not primarily visual the different indices.
4,"such a uniform framework is especially useful for studying integrated drought monitoring (su et al., 2017)."
4,drought indices are simplifying procedures that provide a quantitative map of the hazard by means of reducing the complexity of the drought phenomenon.
4,"although from spatial interpolation of in situ data it is possible to gain a variety of valuable information relating to the severity, duration, and frequency of the droughts, in practice, many factors affect the quality of interpolated output maps (rhee et al., 2010)."
4,this uncertainty highlights the value of rs in providing distributed hydro- meteorological characteristics.
4,"over time, spatial resolution of rs data has been improved."
4,"global observation, near real-time recording, fixed data recording, and improved spatial resolution are the main benefits of satellite-based sensors to traditional gauged observations (heumann, 2011; barrett et al., 1990; barrett and herschy, 1989; morgan, 1989; aghakouchak et al., 2015)."
4,"rs data can be an appropriate source for drought monitoring, especially in areas without measurements or regions with limited in situ measurements."
4,"whereas station data exists, combining rs data with station data may yield better results (table 20.1)."
4,"20.3 drought object modeling drought object modeling (dom) is an ongoing scientific concept in drought assessment that con- verts rs images into geographic phenomena with unique attributes and known behaviors (woryboys et al., 1990; budd, 2000; stein et al., 2009; rulinda et al., 2010)."
4,"object identification in dom was found to be one of the closest ideas to the “knowledge-base actual identification” concept that takes advantage of geographical information systems for automatic interpretation of rs images (batty et al., 1998)."
4,"recorded digital numbers by the satellite sensors is an attribute for satellite images; and behavior refers to the condition that droughts takes place or the vegetation cover dies due to drought occurrence (tucker, 1979; budd, 2000; unisdr, 2009)."
4,"dom utilizes image processing techniques to partition the digital values image into multiple classified segments with approximately homogeneous states (stein et al., 2009)."
4,"various classifier procedures, such as ridges detection, mathematical morphology, and homo- geneity identification, in single band or multiple bands can be employed in dom to identify and classify raster pixels (stein et al., 2009; berhan et al., 2011)."
4,"classification may be accomplished through a variety of statistical algorithms including k-nearest neighbor, naive bayes, and fuzzy clas- sifiers (berhan et al., 2011)."
4,"with the advances in computer hardware, rs images could be used as data."
4,"analysis of large sets of rs images to obtain summarized understandable and practical infor- mation is called “image mining” (stein et al., 2009)."
4,"recently intelligent systems or neural network- based image classifiers have been applied for image object identification (an et al., 2019)."
4,"novel approaches like deep learning rs image classifications are also on the horizon(li et al., 2018)."
5,"364 ﻿integrated drought management, volume 2 20.4 satellite data for drought analysis temporal and spatial variations of drought patterns play an important role in the vulnerability of drought effects."
5,local observations are generally based on a time-limited sampling of a few point sources that do not have a good spatial distribution.
5,"however, rs solves this problem because itis suitable for wide geographical spatial coverage."
5,"rs data, such as digital elevation models, land cover, satellite precipitation data, evapotranspiration products, and soil moisture products, could have different applications in drought assessment."
5,this chapter briefly introduces six mentioned main rs datasets that are primarily needed for drought analysis.
5,"20.4.1 satellite-based precipitation data reduction in precipitation amount is a controlling factor in creating persistent drought events (damberg and aghakouchak, 2014; van loon and laaha, 2015; yan et al., 2018)."
5,"hence, accurate long-term precipitation datasets are essential for drought monitoring and analysis, as rainfall is characterized by major temporal and spatial variability (zeng et al., 2012; zhu et al., 2019)."
5,"both passive and active (radar) rs methods are used to derive satellite-based precipitation data (kidd and levizzani, 2011)."
5,"at present, the development of rs techniques has provided data in remote regions with large-scale coverage."
5,some available satellite-based precipitation products for drought assess- ment are presented in table 20.2.
5,"20.4.2 remotely sensed data for snow cover knowledge of snow cover dynamics along with its depth are two fundamental requirements for the characterization of hydrological droughts (shaban, 2009, kumar et al., 2014, west et al., 2019)."
5,"however,from the hydrological viewpoint, we have to include the following drought-relevant snow parameters to our list: snow water equivalent, snow albedo, and snow melt (kongoli et al., 2012; table 20.2 common satellite-based precipitation products data set resolution timescale coverage period reference gpcp 2.5° monthly global 1979–present adler et al.("

7,"366 ﻿integrated drought management, volume 2 20.4.3 leaf area index products leaf area index (lai) is a dimensionless quantity that can be defined as the area of foliage in the veg- etal cover per ground area (chen andcihlar, 1996)."
7,"lai plays as a controlling factor in the exchange of water and energy among the soil, the atmosphere, and the plant (hueteet al., 2006; wright et al., 1996)."
7,"this ecological characteristic commonly is used for water balance estimation (hueteet al., 2006; wright et al., 1996), estimation of deforestation rate (costa and floi, 2000; fensholtet al., 2004), and spatial and temporal changes in interception (vargas et al., 2002)."
7,satellites themselves are not capable to capture lai values directly.
7,"existing rs approaches for generating lai maps rely on empirical models such as vegetation indices–lai relationships, canopy reflectance model- ing, or hybrid models (barbu et al., 2014)."
7,"statistical correlation between lai and the standardized precipitation index for some regions of the world shows lai derived from satellite (e.g., modis, glass, etc.) products are useful indicators for assessment of vegetation response to drought (kim et al., 2017)."
7,"in terms of practicality, in situ techniques are less favorable, as rs methods are capable of providing large-scale spatial converge without damaging the vegetation canopy (gowdaet al., 2015)."
7,"ground truth measurements are used as validation generally (ariza-carricondo et al., 2019; mourad et al., 2020)."
7,"interested readers are directed to a recent review by fang et al.(2019) who have provided an extensive overview on lai products, applications, and validation (see table 20.5)."
7,"20.4.4 land surface temperature estimation of land surface temperature (lst) is a useful information for analysis of global warm- ing, risk of desertification, and drought severity."
7,"only a few sensors are capable of detecting all the required parameters for lst at high accuracy (sun and pinker, 2003)."
7,most rs products make use of the thermal band for derived lst.
7,"upward land radiation is controlled by lst, and for this reason it has a great value in term of climate studies."
7,hu et al. (2019) suggest that a combined usage of lst and ndvi (normalized difference vegetation index) products may be useful in the assessment of agricultural drought.
7,"to assess drought severity, drought indicators are generally used to identify the degree of environmental anomaly over the longterm."

8,"under drought conditions, evapotranspiration turns into a more significant factor as its inten- sification imposes water stress to the hydrological system."
8,most likely the rs-based scheme is the only approach that has the potential to assess evapotranspiration for large scales.
8,the methods for estimation of evapotranspiration with rs and the surface energy balance approaches are reviewed by liou and kar (2014).
8,different forms of energy balance are generally used for simulation of thermal-based evapotranspiration.

8,"soil moisture is a key indicator of agricultural drought, as it significantly influences both plant growth and productivity (boken et al., 2005; wilhite, 2005)."
8,"in view of water balance modeling, the state of the hydrological system can be seen as the portioning of precipitation in form of variables, like snowpack storage, interception, surface runoff, soil moisture, and groundwater (mcnamara et al., 2011)."
8,"soil moisture is the result of other operating hydrologic components, thus it is greatly variable in spatial and temporal scales."
8,"spatial distribution of soil moisture can be monitored for assessing drought stress using rs (jupp et​.al​., 1998)."

9,the satellite revisit period is one of the major limitations for drought monitoring.
9,"the temporal problem of the daily coverage has been resolved by the cost of coarser spatial resolution (~20 to 50 km) (brocca et al., 2017; abbaszadeh et al., 2018)."

9,20.4.6.1 microwave wavelengths microwave wavelength ranges between 0.5 and 100 cm.
9,"since the sensitivity of microwave wave sensors to soil moisture is high, these sensors are commonly used in both active and inactive water-related applications (njoku andentekhabi, 1996; engman, 1998)."

10,"although there are many factors that affect the out-coming reflectance from the soil surface, in the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum, the reflection is mainly affected by soil moisture and texture (thomasson et al., 2001; kaleita et al., 2005)."
10,"previous studies have made known there exists an inverse relationship between soil moisture and surface spectral reflectance (figure 20.2) (post et al., 2000; galvao et al., 2001)."
10,20.4.6.3 near-infrared spectrum wavelengths the infrared band (thermal radiation) of the electromagnetic spectrum starts from the upper bound- ary of the red visible light with wavelengths of 780 nanometers to 1 millimeter.
10,a combination of thermal infrared and interpretive techniques is commonly used to estimate changes in land surface temperature that is indirectly related to soil moisture.
10,"combining the optical spectrum with ther- mal infrared can provide better results than soil moisture investigation (zhang and zhou, 2016)."
10,"meanwhile, the usefulness of the 1450 nanometer waveband for predicting reliable soil moisture content was reported by some researchers (zhang and zhou, 2016)."

11,data assimilation methods can be classified into two main categories: statistical methods and variational methods.
11,"various data assimilation techniques, such as successive correction (cressman, 1959; bratseth, 1986), optimal interpolation method (lorenzo et al., 2017), 3d/4d variational analy- sis, and the kalman filter (kalman, 1960), are available in the literature."
11,"these approaches are mostly based on a statistical procedure to minimize the sum of the residuals of estimated values (zhangand moore, 2014)."
11,"this mathematical procedure turns out to a better estimation of the state of the hydrological system than what could be achieved by applying the model itself or using the data alone (rodell, 2012)."
11,"for instance, in order to generate a global scale time series of the groundwater storage for drought monitoring, grace satellite observations were combined with the catchment land surface model by li et al. (2019) that resulted in estimating unobserved quantities."
11,"because of the nature of soil moisture, a combination of information with different sources is needed for its estimation (moradkhani, 2008)."
11,"the limitation of satellite observations for soil moisture estimation, inconsistency in temporal and spatial resolution, coverage gaps, and the inac- cessibility to deeper soil moisture are among the major reasons that explain the appropriateness of data assimilation for soil moisture estimation."
11,improvements in the estimation accuracy of soil moisture data is a common report after such applications.
11,kumar et al. (2014) reported that finer timescale drought assessment can be improved by soil moisture data assimilation.
11,xu et al. (2020) reported a better simulation from combining soil moisture active passive (smap) satellite soil moisture observations with in situ measurements.
11,wagner et al. (1999) applied an exponential filter to describe soil moisture dynamics at the root zone using satellites.
11,baldwin et al. (2019) estimated root zone soil moisture across a catchment in the eastern united states using passive microwave satellite data.
11,"kalman filtering is a common method that is used for data assimilation, and produces soil mois- ture estimates of unknown values that tend to show a better accuracy than independent rs data (li et al., 2019)."
11,a theoretical framework based on the kalman filter method was proposed for soil moisture data assimilation by xu et al.
11,(2020).
12,"remote sensing capabilities for observational drought assessment﻿ 371 20.6 conclusions rs is an innovative technology in a wide range of applications/monitoring such as collecting physi- cal characteristics of land surface, vegetation health, acquiring drought information, detecting the level of drought severity, and analyzing the extent."
12,rs information retrieved by various sensors is vital for environmental management during droughts.
12,"the present chapter attempts to review the use of innovative rs datasets, such as satellite-based land cover, soil surface moisture, precipitation, land surface temperature, snow cover, and evaporation, in drought monitoring."
12,"meanwhile from the perspective of drought assessment, soil moisture plays a key role."
12,"rs data can be used directly, or it may also be used for simulating water and energy balance quantitatively."
12,"by taking advantage of distributed hydrological models, rs products may be used to stimulate hydrological components."
12,some of the most important applications of rs data are as follows: 1.
12,use of topographic data (such as digital elevation models).
12,"classify land surface, such as open water, leaf index data, and ndvi maps."
12,use of satellite-derived and radar precipitation data for hydrological modeling.
12,use of surface electromagnetic reflection data and microwave products such as the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer(smmr) and advanced scatterometer (ascat) for evaluating current and past soil moisture.
12,determine land surface temperature in the field of energy balance.
12,remotelysensed data for cover snow area and snow water equivalent.
12,"use ofrs products to configure, calibrate, and validate hydrological models."
12,"in areas that have access to long-term high-quality gauged data, interpolation/extrapolation approaches can be used."
12,"in sites with poor data availability, a combination of the rs data and hydro- logical models may be applied to produce acceptable results."
12,"otherwise, for incomplete, inconsis- tent datasets a combination of rs along with in situ measurements can be used."
12,"the integration of terrestrial and satellite data has many benefits for drought monitoring, assessment, and forecasting."
12,"however, in practice, integrating remote sensing data with one another or integrating them with station data is a complex task."
12,"the process may end up with some issues, such as uncertainty in rs data, scale problems, and combining different datasets/sensor types."
12,"as errors such as shift, rescaling, skew, perspective, and rotation due to ground and satellite movements are taking place, corrections on satellite data are often needed."
12,"for similar reasons, in drought studies calibration and validation of rs-feed hydrological models are essential to help a modeler select the appropriate parameters and minimize errors."
