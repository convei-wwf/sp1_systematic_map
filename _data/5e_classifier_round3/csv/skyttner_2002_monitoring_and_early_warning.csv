1,"in order to adapt such means for the benefit of humanity, existing monitoring methods, basic system design principles and natural short and long environmental transformations were investigated."
1,"finally an integrated automatic system for deformation monitoring and surveying of the chernobyl disaster area, was proposed."
1,the conclusion was that airborne remote sensing including gps and photogrammetry can be considered the optimum solution.
1,introduction in his long history man has constantly been the victim of both short and long term environmental transformations.
1,the possibility to predict and react upon such changes has quite naturally been very limited.
1,"today, in the beginning of the 21th century with advanced satellite system for communication, navigation and observation, this situation has changed."
1,"technical means now exist both to monitor, predict a danger and issue early warnings when something devastating is going to happen in the human environment."
1,"to use such means as survival tools presupposes knowledge of existing monitoring methods, basic system design principles and natural disasters."
1,natural disasters are here seen as short or long term environmental degradation.
1,"starting with the state of the earth’s environment, this paper gives an overview of methods and techniques for monitoring of environmental transformations as well as structural deformations."
1,then design of an integrated systems for monitoring and early warning is presented and exemplified by an application for chernobyl nuclear site.
1,"short term environmental changes a character of short time environmental changes is that they occur suddenly kybernetes, and cause a disaster during a relatively short moment."
1,sometimes it is not vol.
1,"31 no. 2, 2002, pp."
1,"220–245. q mcb up limited, 0368-492x possible to predict its consequences."
1,such phenomena often concern whole doi 10.1108/03684920210417292 populations and are the most devastating of all threats influencing humanity.
2,in shape of natural disasters the examples can be: monitoring and .
2,meteor impacts; early warning .
2,avalanches; systems .
2,forest fires; .
2,flooding; 221 .
2,hurricanes; .
2,cyclones; .
2,tsunamis; .
2,drought; .
2,volcanic eruptions; .
2,landslides; .
2,earthquakes; and .
2,ultraviolet radiation.
2,today the impact of manmade disasters tend to be in parity with big natural disasters.
2,"the biggest possible manmade disaster, the nuclear holocaust, is on a level with a big meteor impact."
2,the most serious items on a list regarding manmade disasters are the following: .
2,nuclear war; .
2,chemical and bacteriological warfare; .
2,radioactive fallout (core meltdown); .
2,release of infectious bacteria and virus; .
2,environmental and climatological influence with failure of the crop; and .
2,dam destruction with flooding.
2,some of the items can also be categorized as failed large industrial buildings and structures.
2,"storms, hurricanes, and cyclones are events which release strong natural forces."
2,"a storm is usually described as a very strong wind which can transport snow, dust, sand or rain."
2,a hurricane is a violent windstorm.
2,a cyclone is a violent wind rotation around a central area.
2,"during the last four decades cyclones have increased markedly in both frequency and magnitude (kerpelman, 1994)."
2,"in an average year there are some 70– 80 tropical cyclones world-wide, with damage estimated to about 1.5 billion dollars."
2,cyclones only form overseas with a surface temperature of above 27 degrees c.
2,"global warming is increasing the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones with an 40 –50 percent increase in their destructive power (bryant, 1991)."
2,in september 1988 a cyclone in the bay of bengal resulted in a
3,"kybernetes storm surge and widespread flooding which affected 48 million bangladeshis, 31,2 destroying at least one million homes."
3,a flood is usually defined as a coming of a great quantity of water in a place that is usually dry.
3,"very often floods are closely associated with other events like storms, cyclones and rainfalls."
3,"during the period 1967– 91 there were about 300,000 deaths only from foods (un department of human affairs 222 1993)."
3,"an intensification of the cyclone system, which is already going on, enhances the risk of coastal flooding."
3,"at the same time, coastal flooding would be aggravated by intensification of the hydrological cycle as well (schlesinger 1993)."
3,"preliminary risk evaluation estimates the total of people at risk of sea-level rise to be 73 million in china, 20 million in india and elsewhere 31 million (myers and kent, 1995)."
3,earthquakes are usually closely related to plate tectonics.
3,"once the friction bond or pressure holding together two ribs of a fault is broken, the elastic strain energy is suddenly released in form of an earthquake."
3,"at the very event, the earth experiences seismic waves."
3,large earthquakes can produce considerable horizontal and vertical movements in the range of metres.
3,"at the 1905 san francisco, california, earthquake, which had an magnitude of 8.3, horizontal movements exceeding 5 metres have been reported."
3,"during the period 1967– 91, there were 600,000 deaths from earthquakes (kempelman, 1994)."
3,"at sea-bottoms, seismic and other events cause long wavelength waves, tsunamis."
3,"approaching shore, these waves can reach a height of more than 50 metres and travel several kilometres into the land destroying everything in their way."
3,volcanism occurs when magma generated in the upper mantle is squeezed upward through cracks in the crust caused by faults or structure weaknesses.
3,"most of today’s active volcanoes are located in three belts: the circum-pacific belt, the ocean ridge systems, and the alpine-himalayan belt."
3,"thermal energy generated by tectonic activities, such as crustal compression or extension, causes the rock to melt."
3,the latter causes volcanism to occur along mid-ocean ridges.
3,hot-spots are the least common type of volcanic activity.
3,"several large industrial buildings and structures like dams, power stations and bridges has collapsed in the past."
3,"notable examples are the catastrophes in rempen 1924, glenau 1932 and stava 1985 in europe and, saint francis 1928 and tenton 1976 in the usa (krakiwsky, 1986)."
3,other examples are the bophal spill of toxic chemicals in india and the chernobyl nuclear reactor accident.
3,"the chernobyl event, with a radioactive fallout of fifty times that of hiroshima and irradiating an area of 200,000 square kilometres, caused 116,000 people to evacuate the area within 30 kilometres of the nuclear station."
3,"regarding chernobyl, it must be kept in mind that there are another sixteen chernobyl- type power stations in western russia and eastern europe, some of them notoriously unstable."
4,long term environmental degradation monitoring and long term environmental degradation are continuous processes which are early warning active during many years.
4,"in the beginning it is sometimes difficult to observe systems their influence, but after an accurate monitoring of environmental parameters it is possible to discover what is going on."
4,"it is, however, often possible to predict the impact on the environment in the future."
4,the most common scenario of changes is that first it is possible to observe only small changes which usually 223 accelerate.
4,"when a threshold of carrying capacity of environment is passed, the result is a mass exodus of people from the risk area."
4,"generally, the following long term environmental degradations are visible: . deforestation and overgrazing with soil erosion and decertification; . garbage accumulation, nuclear radiation, water, soil, and air pollution; . water salinisation, acidification and deficits, decreasing subsoil water, droughts; . decreasing biodiversity and extinction of species; . global warming and shrinking ozone layer with melting of polar ice caps; and . development disruptions."
4,today humans use and waste almost 55 percent of the accessible water.
4,the rest is left for the other species.
4,"in 1993 the total number of water-short people was 335 million and is expected to soar to 1.5 billion in 2010 and 3 billion in 2025 (myers and kent, 1995)."
4,"according to other sources (gleick, 1993) the number of people who experience shortages of renewable water could even grow to the order of 4.4 billion by 2050."
4,"countries enduring absolute water scarcity (defined as 500 cubic metres or less of water per person and year) will be countries like morocco, algeria, burundi etc. with a total population of 250 millions."
4,"quite naturally, this is one of the main problems for agriculture, industry and, household in large urban communities, which in addition run the risk of water-related diseases."
4,about 90 percent of developing-country diseases is due to lack of clean water for domestic use.
4,water shortages could be made worse by increasing droughts in wake of global warming.
4,"salinisation and water logging of irrigated land is a relatively new problem which is connected to water deficits, and which will become very dangerous in the future."
4,"irrigated lands, which are prime food-producing areas, produce one third of our food from only on sixth of all crop-lands."
4,"irrigated areas expanded by two to four percent per year during 1950 – 80, but by average of only one percent per year since then (brown, 1994)."
4,"as much as 3.5 million square kilometres of irrigated lands have been salinized, and 15.000 – 20.000 square kilometres are lost every year."
5,"kybernetes because of salinization together with water logging, 450.000 square 31,2 kilometres of irrigated lands in developing countries need immediate and costly reclamation or they will be lost for agriculture."
5,"if the current loss of irrigated land persist, nearly 30 percent of the total area will be lost by 2025 and nearly 50 percent by 2050 (kendall and pimentel, 1994)."
5,"224 another problem, associated with water shortages, is droughts."
5,sub- saharan africa is the region where the droughts together with land degradation are very common.
5,"it is the prime reason why 30 million people faced constant threat of famine and starvation (rahmato, 1991)."
5,the number of starving people in this region could well have reached 100 million by the year 2005.
5,"other regions and countries which are strongly affected by droughts are the sahel, north africa and mexico."
5,"desertification is a process in which a cultivated land is becoming uncultivated, waterless and very often treeless."
5,both climatic change or humans can start this process.
5,one third of earth’s land surface is threatened with desertification.
5,at least 900 million people in 100 countries are experiencing severe desertification.
5,the process of desertification eliminates 60.000 square kilometres of agricultural land each year.
5,the cost of agricultural output lost is around 42 billion dollar per year.
5,"desertification is the prime form of land degradation in several countries and regions like northeastern brazil, north/central mexico, western india and north africa (cardy, 1994)."
5,the problem has already triggered some of the most broadscale migration in recent decades from a pool of 900 million people at risk.
5,soil erosion is the process in which topsoil is eroded away.
5,"during the period from 1975 to 1995 some 500 billion tonnes of topsoil have been eroded away, an equivalent to all the topsoil in india’s cropland."
5,"in the absence of better soil conservation practices, 1.4 million square kilometres, equal in area to alaska, will lose most of their good-quality soil over the next two decades (brown, 1993)."
5,today half a billion impoverished people in developing countries find themselves obliged to farm hillsides where they cause exceptional erosion.
5,"generally, soil erosion causes annual losses in farm output worth 0.5 to 1.5 percent of national gnp according to geographical position."
5,"deforestation is almost always associated with soil erosion, watershed degradation and environmental desiccation."
5,"all these factors have caused large-scale involuntary migrations in philippines, ethiopia, madagascar, peru and many other countries (meyers, 1992)."
5,tropical deforestation is also the cause of the bulk of species extinctions.
5,"well over half of all deforestation is caused by slash-and-bum cultivators, most of them being peasants displaced by soil erosion, water deficits, landless-ness, poverty and population pressure (peskin, 1989)."
5,"today, well over half of all developing-world people, 3 billions, are expected to be gaining their supplies only by over-harvesting."
5,a widespread consequence of the pertinent deforestation is severe fuel-wood shortage.
6,"by 2010, tropical forests will likely have lost another 40 to 50 percent of their monitoring and already rapid decreasing areas."
6,"this broadscale deforestation will lead to early warning widespread degradation of watershed systems, disruption of rainfall regimes, systems and an increase in the albedo effect."
6,"also, a sharp increase in greenhouse gas emission will be a consequence due to the loss of the forest’s carbon-sink function."
6,global warming is today estimated to induce a worldwide rise in 225 temperature of 0.25 degrees c per decade.
6,by 2025 we will have a doubling of greenhouse gases as measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents.
6,this will accelerate the process of global warming and it is expected that the average temperature rise will be almost 1 degree c at this moment.
6,"consequences of this process will be intensification of rainfall in certain regions, changes in the cyclone and monsoons systems, shifts in the el ninjo southern oscillation, sea level rise and increased incidence of droughts and soil erosion (schneider, 1989)."
6,global warming models predict more violent weather in many parts of the world as the atmosphere slowly but steadily warms up.
6,"another future effect could be growing agricultural losses due to the spread of pests and diseases, saltwater intrusion caused by sea-level rise and additional demand for freshwater supplies (pittock and flather, 1993)."
6,development disruption of environment is caused by large-scale human activities.
6,examples are in particular to be found in mega-scale projects concerning extensive dam-buildings.
6,project of this sort have already caused the resettlement of 20 million people in india and 30 million in china.
6,it is estimated that they currently uproot more than 10 million developing-world inhabitants every year (source: world bank 1995).
6,outsize dams alone have displaced 1.5 million people worldwide in just a few decades.
6,"the three gorges dam on the yangtze river is expected to uproot well over one million people when completed (quing, 1994)."
6,"more than one thousand dams with walls over 15 metres high are under construction, most of them in developing countries."
6,"associated problems to development disruption, like biodiversity depletion, population pressure, gross-scale pollution and environmental discontinuities now exists everywhere."
6,biodiversity depletion exerts an indirect and long-term impact.
6,it means that 50.000 species a year from a pool of 10 million are extinct.
6,"this extinction rate is accelerating rapidly and we can estimate that half of all species and populations will be lost in the middle of the next century (wilson, 1992)."
6,another problem is associated with decreasing biomass.
6,we have already destroyed about 40 percent of earth’s net plant growth (vitousek et al.
6,1986).
6,"the most serious problem is, however, considered to be population pressure."
6,"just now the global population amounts to 6 billion people, with 4.7 billion in developing countries and 1.3 billion in developed countries."
6,"using a medium variant of un population projections, world population is estimated to 9.8 billion"
7,"kybernetes in 2050 (un, 1994)."
7,"here the poorest countries have population growth rates 31,2 50 percent higher than the average for all developing countries."
7,"such trends will severely exceed the earth’s carrying capacity and cause problems of economic, social and environmental kinds."
7,"many unemployed people will gain a livelihood only by cultivating marginal lands such as forests, dry savannahs and hilly terrain."
7,"their struggle for life will cause deforestation, 226 overgrazing, desertification and soil erosion."
7,a consequence of the problems of “too many” is rapid urbanisation and the phenomenon of mega-cities (defined as having at least 10 million inhabitants).
7,"environmental refugees move, first of all, to urban communities."
7,in 1950 only 18 percent of all people lived in urban communities.
7,"today 50 percent live there and an estimate for 2025 is 75 percent (un, 1993)."
7,many urban communities of the developing countries are expanding at least twice as fast as national populations.
7,"just now, one quarter of the developing world’s people are living in some 300 cities with more than one million inhabitants. 50 of them are cities with more than four million people."
7,"a “threshold effect” (lowe, 1991) is visible, which means that mega-cities themselves become a source of environmental refugees due to severe over-loading of their facilities."
7,environmental discontinuities occur when resource stocks of ecosystems absorb stresses over long periods without much outward sign of damage.
7,"then, suddenly, a disruption level is reached at which the cumulative consequences of stress reveal themselves through systemic changes of a critical scale (myers, 1992)."
7,"as an example can be given the building up of green-house gases, which, after accumulating for decades, triggers a discontinuity for climate systems worldwide."
7,acid rain is also a familiar example.
7,"discontinuities of this kind can be expected to be more frequent in the future, as the number of people increases and with them the demands on shrinking resource stocks."
7,monitoring methods for analysis of structural deformations the opportunity for preparation and adaptation is vital for human life.
7,structural deformations are often the first indication of coming environmental changes like them which has been presented in the previous paragraphs the possibility to monitor and calculate the consequences of such deformations and if necessary forward early warnings must be considered an important survival tool.
7,"this paper does not, however, present the status of monitoring techniques and observations methods for all applications."
7,it will only give a general description and some important references which can be a base for more detailed studies of a particular application.
7,"deformations are usually correlated to time and can be: . temporary, elastic, reversible; and . permanent, plastic, irreversible."
8,structural deformation problems cover the entire spectrum of engineering.
8,"monitoring and they include nuclear power stations, dams, bridges, underground excavations early warning like mines and tunnels and even land slides or ground subsidence problems. systems deformations can be caused by, e.g.: . environmental influences; . settlement of the soil; 227 . changes in the water table; . ground movements due to mass extraction of water, gas, coal etc."
8,"; . insufficient quality of building materials and mounting devices; . incorrect placing of structural parts; . dimensional errors in the different stages of construction; and . unexpected variations in static, dynamic or other forces, etc."
8,the development of new method for optimal modelling and prediction within the area have been subject to intensive studies by many professional groups at national and international levels.
8,some of the most active international organisations which are involved in deformation studies are: .
8,international federation of surveyors (fig); .
8,international commission on large dams (icold); .
8,international association of geodesy (iag); .
8,international society for mine surveying (ism); .
8,international society for rock mechanics (isrm); and .
8,international association of hydrological sciences (yahoos).
8,"these organisations provide very intensive activities, but a well know problem is a general lack of communication and work co-ordination."
8,"the studies of the various professional groups, not only at the international but also at the national level of individual countries, often overlap each other."
8,duplication of efforts in methods and techniques take place although they are well known to other study groups.
8,the main purpose of the monitoring is to check whether the behaviour of the object and its environment follow a predicted pattern so that any unpredicted deformation could be detected at an early stage.
8,the monitoring of deformations means determination of: . the geometrical change in shape and dimensions of the object; . rigid body translations and rotations (absolute and/or relative) of the monitored object;
9,"kybernetes . acting forces (loads) and internal stresses which can either be measured 31,2 directly or indirectly by derivation from measurements of temperature, poor water pressure, water level etc.; and . physical properties of the deformable material (e.g. module elasticity, tensile strength, creep parameters, porosity etc.)."
9,"228 the measuring techniques and instrumentation for geometrical monitoring of deformations have traditionally been divided into two main groups: . geodetic and photo-grammetric surveys which include satellite positioning (gps), and some special techniques such as interferometry, hydrostatic levelling, alignment etc.; and . geotechnical measurements of local deformations using tiltmeters, strainmeters, extensometers, joint-meters, plumb-lines, etc.."
9,"in seismic active areas, the monitoring schemes must include special instrumentation for measuring vibrations."
9,each type of measurement has its own advantages and disadvantages (chzanowski et al.
9,1986).
9,"geodesic and photogrammetric surveys gives global information on the behaviour of the object while the geotechnical measurements give localised and, very frequently, locally disturbed information without any check unless compared with some other independent measurements."
9,"the advantage of geotechnical instruments is that they are easier to adapt to automatic and continuous monitoring than conventional geodetic instruments conventional geodetic surveys are labour intensive, while geotechnical instruments, once installed, require only infrequent checks on their performance."
9,geodetic surveys have traditionally been used mainly for determining the absolute displacements of selected points on the surface of the object with respect to some reference points.
9,geotechnical measurements have been used mainly for relative deformation measurements within the object and its surroundings.
9,4.1 electronic distance and angle measurement electronic theodolites are designed to precisely measure horizontal and vertical angles.
9,the technological progress in angle measurement is manly associated with the automation of the readout system.
9,they are normally equipped with a microprocessor controlled bi-axial sensor (electronic tiltmeters) which can sense the inclination of the theodolite to an accuracy better than 0.500 and correct for vertical and horizontal direction readouts.
9,the requirement of two positions must always be obeyed in order to eliminate errors caused by mechanical misalignment of the theodolite’s axial system.
9,this applies to all types of theodolites.
9,4.2 three-dimensional positioning systems based on angular measurements two electronic theodolites linked to a computer create a three-dimensional positioning system.
9,when the positions of the theodolites are known and the
10,"directions to a new point, which we want to determine, are measured from monitoring and the stations, the co-ordinates of the new point can be calculated on-line."
10,"when early warning the positions of the theodolites are unknown, short invar rods of known length systems are include in the measuring scheme to provide scale for the calculation of co-ordinates."
10,"the number of the theodolites connected to the same computer can be more than two, if we want to increase the accuracy of positioning."
10,in such cases 229 distances up to ten metres away may be determined with a standard deviation smaller than 0.05 millimetres.
10,"4.3 electronic distance measurements the electronic distance measurement instrument, or edmi, was introduced in the late 1950s."
10,current edms use either infrared light or microwaves.
10,the range can be up to 60 km and the accuracy up to 1ppm.
10,an accuracy better than 1 ppm can be achieved if instruments with dual frequency radiation source are used.
10,"such instruments are, however, very expensive (about $300 000)."
10,edm instruments must be frequently calibrated for the zero correction and for scale (change in the modulation frequency).
10,"in engineering projects of high precision, the instrument should be calibrated at least twice a year, or before and after each important project, following special procedures."
10,4.4 total stations and survey robots a total station is an electronic theodolite linked to an edm instrument and to a computer.
10,"it allows for simultaneous measurements of the three basic positioning parameters distance, horizontal direction, and vertical angle, from which 3d positions of the observed points can be determined directly in the field."
10,different models of total stations are available on the market.
10,some of them can perform measurements automatically.
10,"several manufactures offer very sophisticated stations, which vary in accuracy, range, and possibilities for on-line data processing."
10,"for continuous or frequent monitoring of deformations, fully automatic monitoring robot systems based on computerised and motorised total stations have been developed."
10,"in general, surveying robots can be defined to be universally applicable automates with several axes and sensors whose movements and measuring processes can be programmed and executed without manual intervention."
10,"normally they are equipped with devices suitable for measuring distances and angles, or with interferometric tools."
10,"that is, they can project laser-point targets on objects under survey."
10,"the robots can be programmed for sequential self-pointing to a set of targets at predetermined time intervals and they can measure distances and horizontal and vertical angles, and can transmit the data to the office computer via a telemetry link."
10,"generally, the accuracy of direction measurements with the self-pointing computerised theodolites is about 300 ."
11,"kybernetes 4.5 monitoring of vertical movements by levelling and trigonometric height 31,2 measurement the elevation difference between points a and b can be determined by measuring their vertical distance from a horizontal line of sight."
11,this illustrates the basic idea of differential levelling.
11,the method is still the most reliable and accurate surveying method for determination of height difference.
11,"230 by using high magnification levelling instruments, equipped with a parallel glass plate micrometer and with invar graduated rods, a standard deviation smaller than 0.1 mm per set-up may be achieved."
11,this is true as long as the balanced lines of sight do not exceed 20 metres.
11,"in levelling over long distances with the lines of sight not exceeding 30 m, a standard deviation of 1 mm per kilometre may be achieved in flat terrain."
11,the most dangerous error sources are influence of atmospheric refraction and earth curvature.
11,they are minimised by balancing the lines of sight between the forward and backward levelling rods.
11,"the described method cannot, however, be applied for all practical applications."
11,"in the determination of the elevation of a tower, however, trigonometric height measurement had to be used."
11,"using high precision electronic theodolites and edm equipment, an accuracy better than 1 mm may be achieved in height difference determination between two targets 200 m apart."
11,"the accuracy of trigonometric height measurements, is from a practical point of view, independent of the height differences."
11,"similarly as in geometrical levelling, the most dangerous error source is influence of atmospheric refraction and earth curvature."
11,"4.6 photogrammetric techniques in photogrammetry, measurement of monitored object are carried out indirectly."
11,the phenomenon to be evaluated is photographed from two or more locations and measurements are performed on the overlapping photographs.
11,"a wide range of methods are used, from simple scales to sophisticated computer assisted equipment."
11,digital technology has given photogrammetry a push forward and several new applications have been developed.
11,"photogrammetry is to prefer when object are large, cumbersome or cannot be touched."
11,"this is a common situation after an earthquake, when many affected structures are unstable and fear of aftershocks has to be taken in consideration."
11,"especially for monitoring of nuclear plants, photogrammetry must be considered a relevant technique."
11,"among the main advantages of photogrammetry, the reduced time of field work and the easy calculation of 3d co-ordinates of the object points, must be considered."
11,an unlimited number of points can be monitored and a great number of pictures can be taken during a short time (more than 500 images per second).
11,it is easy to measure also moving objects and the design of real-time systems for automatic measurement of object is possible to do with low costs in
12,comparison with other techniques.
12,"recently, solid state cameras with ccd monitoring and (charge couple device) sensors have been available for static and dynamic early warning applications. systems the accuracy of photogrammetric positioning depends mainly on accuracy of the determination of the image co-ordinates and the scale of the photographs."
12,image co-ordinates may be determinated with an accuracy of about ^1 micrometers.
12,231 4.7 alignment measurements this is a classical method of geodetic measuring.
12,alignment is used to determine distance of discrete points with respect to a reference line or to align a discrete point along a given strait line.
12,"it is especially suited for monitoring deformation of engineering structures like bridges, dams, and nuclear accelerometers."
12,mechanical alignment is characterised by the realisation of the reference line by a stretched wire.
12,the wire is either made of hard steel or of a synthetic fibre like kevlar.
12,"due to its simplicity, high accuracy (0.1 mm is possible) it is often used for continuous monitoring of structural deformations over distances up to a few hundred metres."
12,electro-optical alignment uses the optical line of sight or a laser beam as reference line.
12,it allows for automation of alignment procedures and for continuous data acquisition.
12,"besides the influence of atmospheric refraction, pointing and focussing are the main sources of error when using an optical telescope."
12,diffraction alignment means that the reference line is created by projecting a pattern of diffraction slits.
12,the highest accuracy and the longest range are obtained with the so-called fresnel zone plates which acts as focussing lenses.
12,deformation measurement of a 3 km long nuclear accelerator gave a relative accuracy of 102 7 of the distance (herrmansfeldt et al.
12,1967).
12,4.8 mechanical measurement of changes in distance and strain the distance can be determinated by sequential placing of an invar wire or a tape extensometer.
12,wire extensometers can give an accuracy of 0.05 mm or better in the interval of 1 to 20 metres if properly calibrated and used.
12,"also measuring rods made of materials like invar, aluminium or fibreglass can be used."
12,they are possible to produce with good accuracy up to a length of 5 metres.
12,"telescopic tubes may replace rods in some applications, e.g. in measuring the convergence between the roof and floor in underground mining."
12,for some applications such as scanning of boreholes a torpedo can be used.
12,several models of torpedo borehole extensometers and sliding micrometers are available on the market.
12,the accuracy of 0.1 mm can be achieved for sequential measurement.
13,"kybernetes 4.9 tilt and inclination measurements 31,2 tiltmeters and inclinometers are used in engineering survey when it is necessary to define deviations from horizontal and vertical planes."
13,"dependably on application, it is possible to choose among different models of liquid, electrostatic, vibrating wire, and pendulum type of instruments."
13,"many source of errors, however, affect the accuracy of the measurements."
13,"temperature 232 changes produce dimensional changes of the mechanical components, and alter the viscosity of the liquid (in electrolytic tiltmeters) and damping oil in the pendulum instruments."
13,normally an accuracy of 0.1 mm over a distance of 20 metres can be achieved in measurements of tilt.
13,suspended and inverted (floating) plumb lines are two methods for mechanical plumbing.
13,"the plumbing device consists of a wire, (usually of invar) with attached plumb weight."
13,"if the plumb line is installed outside the structure, a vertical pipe of proper inner diameter should be used to protect the wire from the wind."
13,inverted plumb lines gives the possibility of monitoring absolute displacements of a structure with respect to deeply anchored points which can be considered stable.
13,vertical movements of the structure with respect to the bedrock can also be determined.
13,"if influence of air currents and the spiral shape of wires a taken in consideration, and accuracy of 0.1 mm or better can be achieved."
13,optical plummets consists of a telescope with crosshairs which can be levelled with the aid of two level bubbles.
13,sometimes the plummets are equipped with laser.
13,the relative accuracy is about 1/200.000.
13,hydrostatic levels use the fact that in connected tubes the clam surface of a liquid forms a horizontal plane.
13,its line of sight is automatically level.
13,several automatic instruments have been developed which normally are connected to permanently installed networks in order to monitor changes in height differences of large structures.
13,a factor limiting the accuracy is the temperature effect which always must be taken into consideration.
13,the accuracy ranges from 0.1 mm to 0.01 mm over a few metres depending on the instrument.
13,"4.10 automated data management of deformation measurements under normal circumstances, the interval of time between sensing and analysis may extend over several days or more."
13,"when critical conditions occur, this is not acceptable."
13,very often real time information about the condition of the object is necessary.
13,"in such situations, an automatic system would be a superior solution."
13,"according to dunnicliff, (1988) the advantages of an automatic data acquisition system are the following: . personal costs for reading instruments and analysis of data, are reduced; . real time information about the condition of the object is possible; . retrieval of data from remote or inaccessible locations is possible;"
14,". instantaneous transmission of data over long distances is possible; monitoring and . excellent reading sensitiveness and accuracy can be achieved; early warning . increased flexibility in selecting required data can be provided; systems . extremely rapid fluctuations, pulsations, and vibrations are possible to detect; 233 . recording errors are fewer and immediately recognized; and . data can be stored electronically in suitable format for direct computer analysis."
14,"unfortunately such systems also have disadvantages of the following kind: . an excess of data is generated, easily leading to a failure in timely response; . data may be uncritical accepted, leading to wrong conclusion; . high initial costs and often high maintenance costs; . the need for site-specific components which may be expensive and unproven; . specialised personnel often required for regular checks and maintenance,; . a manual method is required as an alternative; and . a reliable and continuous source of power is required."
14,"a conclusion will, however, say that the advantages of an automatic system easily outweighs its disadvantages."
14,"such systems have already been commonplace, particularly in the monitoring of dams, hydro-electric power stations and nuclear power plants."
14,space methods for monitoring of environmental changes significant developments have taken place in satellite geodesy with the gps system.
14,it is now possible to solve problems which so far have been insoluble with classical measurement methods.
14,with this system it is no longer relevant to say: the larger the distance the larger the costs and the worse the accuracy.
14,measurement with gps is weather independent and gives three dimensional co-ordinates in a significant short time.
14,the three co-ordinates are essential for deformation analysis as the geometry of the object gives information of what is going on.
14,it is today possible to build gps-systems with antenna-sensors connected to one or more computers.
14,the computer then calculates the object’s position and geometry and the result is transmitted to a network in charge of safety.
14,good gps-technology gives principally the same accuracy as high-precision geodetic measurements for monitoring of large structure behaviour.
14,the condition is that the elimination of systematic errors has been performed
15,kybernetes properly.
15,"the development of gps receivers, low-cost reliable and high-rate 31,2 telemetry links, and the development of tools for processing, storing and retrieval of large volumes of data allow continuous monitoring of deformation at a relatively low cost."
15,today remote sensing methods based on data from aircraft and satellites give the opportunity to monitor environmental changes over a period of time.
15,"234 new data can be continuously compared with older data, and with historical information from aerial photography and maps."
15,"the data processing tool is often a geographical information system, gis, and the result shows what changes have occurred, but also what could be expected in the future."
15,in the study of rapid environmental changes satellite imagery is extremely useful.
15,in such an application the core component of the system is gis-based and combined with the latest communications and weather-forecasting technologies.
15,"long term change detection is technically possible as images from different points in time can be digitally compared and changes detected, analysed, explained and assessed for appropriate future action."
15,a typical application is the study of changes of woody biomass content in developing countries.
15,often a satellite system is part of what can be called a hybrid system.
15,hybrid systems includes several different sensors.
15,the individual components of hybrid systems add independent information which cannot be gained and controlled by one component alone.
15,"the information is integrated in such a way that the individual measurements complete, support and control each other."
15,measured data are redundant to a certain extent so that systematic errors can be estimated and failure of individual components can be neutralised.
15,the complexity and flexibility of hybrid systems allow the solution of many problems and are suitable for the opening up of new fields.
15,"5.1 protecting the environment by analysing the complex relationship between the environment and human populations in a certain area, informed decision can be done."
15,it is possible to map and model air dispersion and downstream water dilution contaminants that may affect important areas like national parks etc.
15,"the use of satellite image maps for declination of rain forest stands or slope maps to assess erosion hazards following tropical rainfall, are very common."
15,5.2 agricultural surveying application of remote sensing techniques in agriculture has now been used for several years.
15,"typical is usa’s interest to obtain information of the world’s cereal production (curran, 1985)."
15,"this was satisfied by the large area crop inventory experiment (lacie) which concerned estimation of the wheat production in the ussr, latin america, china, and australia."
15,data was derived from sensors onboard landsat and a number of meteorological satellites.
16,the resulting information was considered worth more than $200 million/year monitoring and to us agricultural industry. early warning systems 5.3 surveying of soil erosion the effects of water erosion on soil is an increasing problem in the world of today.
16,"it is felt not only in areas where the top soil is removed, but also in areas 235 further down-valley where the ground is covered with sand and silt deposits."
16,the result is channels which are clogged with sediments and reservoirs which are silted.
16,four parameters are the most critical for soil erosion caused by water.
16,"these are field cover, rainfall erosivity, slope gradient and slope parameters."
16,"their estimation can be performed by means of remote sensing, digital elevation models, and gis systems."
16,5.4 forest surveying conventional methods for forest inventory like interpretation of aerial photographs and field inventory are expensive and the data quality is often inconsistent.
16,"by use of satellite based methods, the costs are about half when comparing with older methods."
16,in satellite based forest inventory all existing information is digitised and edited on the remote sensing/gis workstation monitor.
16,the monitor background is a high resolution satellite imagery.
16,forest stand qualitative estimates are derived from the reflectance properties.
16,"the regular tabular data, ancillary data and the estimates are in turn statistically combined in order to achieve new composite estimates with higher precision."
16,"5.5 surveying of land transformation drought, natural erosion, and man-made land degradation may lead to a deterioration of the land quality."
16,"in attempt to differentiate between the impact of man versus the impact of climate on the environment, a number of physical, biological and social variables have to be tested."
16,these can be obtained from remote sensing monitoring.
16,albedo differences are often used together with normalised difference vegetation index between various years.
16,in arid and semi-arid environment the use of albedo is a more appropriate measure of land quality then any vegetation index.
16,the information content in the latter is very restricted during the dry season.
16,5.6 surveying of build environment detecting of damages and anomalies of technical infrastructure by means of remote sensing is today possible with high accuracy.
16,"several systems such as roads, dams, bridges, and district heating networks need continuos maintenance in order to secure functions and to prolong technical life-span."
17,"kybernetes to decrease the cost of energy and above all to eliminate the strong 31,2 environmental effects of energy consumption is another important task."
17,a problem which is directly connected to the global warming is leakage of methane gas from both natural gas pipelines and from land filled bodies.
17,pollution of ground water caused by industrial disposals and processes is another big problem for most countries.
17,"236 to solve such problems, remote sensing, infrared thermography, laser and radar have become important tools."
17,tools of this kind are airborne or implemented in satellite systems.
17,"5.7 population mapping remote sensing is possible to use when estimating the number of people struck, to monitor gross refugee movements and in population census."
17,census is the primary source of data on population dynamics and essential for all governmental planning regarding population pressure and emigration/immigration trends.
17,modern remote sensing for population mapping is very attractive and useful for development countries when a quick information about the population state is necessary for governmental decision making.
17,for developed countries these methods can be used as a support for traditional censuses.
17,5.8 surveying in oceanography and hydrology remote sensing by satellite now plays the most important role for surveying of oceanic areas which cover about 70 per cent of the planet.
17,"many different applications for this purpose have been developed, for example sea ice mapping for shipping and icebreaker routing."
17,"another important task is detection of changes in aquatic ecosystems, monitoring of algae blooms and measuring of sea surface temperature."
17,"in hydrology a method for mapping of snow coverage, studies on water quality and groundwater resources assessment are among the most important tasks."
17,information of this kind has fundamental value for the extent of groundwater utilisation in connection with irrigation in different areas.
17,"also groundwater budgeting, delineation of over-exploited areas and the identification of problem settlement zones can be managed by this kind of information."
17,5.9 meteorology remote sensing data from satellites is a key for diagnosing of present weather and air conditions.
17,"data is processed in order to analyse clouds and to develop numerical prediction models for weather, solar radiation, stratospheric ozone and ultraviolet radiation."
18,"a number of atmospheric environmental models for the long-range monitoring and transport contribution to the total air pollution have also been developed. early warning an example is the mach model, which is a three-dimensional atmospheric systems model for environmental assessment and nuclear alert."
18,"it includes the physical and chemical processes of sources, atmospheric transport and sinks of trace constituents."
18,it can be configured with an arbitrary number of vertical layers and is applied to different geographical areas with different spatial 237 resolutions.
18,design of monitoring systems for environmental disaster areas environmental disasters usually occur very rapidly and can cause enormous changes of all objects in a large zone.
18,"areas affected have some common properties, such as: . they are usually difficult for inspection; . topography of the area can be totally changed; . mass exodus of living creatures from the area take place, because staying will threat the continuous existence; . living conditions at the disaster zone are often hazardous with: – shortages of clean water and food; – infrastructure and communication systems out of order; – extreme weather conditions; and – contaminated soil and water."
18,the most important thing to do after the disaster is to obtain information about: . the situation at the area; . if the forces which caused the disaster still is active or not; . needs for providing a rescue operation; . needs for supply of life for people remaining in the area; . communication possibilities with people remaining in the area; . investigation of accessible local resources available; and . investigation if local authorities have prepared disaster planning and if this is relevant and has been released.
18,"gathering of information about the state of the disaster area can be performed by the use of the following methods: . direct access and analysis of data from active satellites, which continuously control the state of the global environment;"
19,"kybernetes . flying over the area direct accessing data by the use of different sensors 31,2 installed on the airborne platform; . the use of mobile hybrid systems for collection of geographical information; . direct contact with people dwelling in the disaster area; and 238 . computer simulation of the disaster progress with the use of real parameters obtained from the disaster zone."
19,this is possible if there exist prepared computer programs for simulation supplied by authorities responsible for regional security.
19,a great number of satellites which continuously gather information about the state of the world now exist.
19,in the pertinent satellite database it is possible to find detailed description of all active sensors.
19,"after having obtained the satellite data these can be processed, analysed and conclusions about the situation in the disaster area can be drawn."
19,changes of the situation in near future can be concluded.
19,disadvantages sometimes are low data quality due to weather conditions (heavy clouds).
19,flying over the area and directly accessing data by use of different sensors is a method with several advantages.
19,here unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) can be used.
19,these can be equipped with gps systems for automated navigation.
19,the data from the airborne sensors can be sent directly to the computer center for analysis.
19,uavs can fly in extreme weather conditions and over areas with high radiation without exposing anybody to danger.
19,gathering of information can be performed in a selective way with emphasis on the areas in danger.
19,use of hybrid systems (see section 5) is another tool for collection of geographical information.
19,it could be an inertial navigation system mounted together with gps and video or cdd cameras in a vehicle.
19,in this way its is possible to obtain a kinematic stereo-vision system capable of capturing data of road or railway environment at high speed.
19,the coordinates of all points in the field of view of the cameras can be determined and transformed into a homogeneous coordinate system.
19,computer simulation of the disaster progress with the use of real parameters obtained from the catastrophe zone is a good method to obtain realistic information about the situation without direct inspection of the area.
19,the computer program should be prepared and tested in advance by authorities responsible for the area.
19,simulation parameters can be obtained from automated monitoring systems established in advance at the disaster area.
19,people dwelling at the area during the disaster can also deliver important parameters.
19,"when data have been collected and processed to useful information and thereafter analysed, it is possible to predict what will happen in the future."
19,different scenarios with regard to the acting forces are now taken into
20,consideration.
20,"results have to be stored and distributed, first of all, to people monitoring and who are responsible for the security of the area or object."
20,"if further potential early warning danger is detected in the pre-processing, warning procedures should be systems released."
20,a monitoring system for chernobyl site 239 the name chernobyl is well known all over the world due to the catastrophe in 1984 of the nuclear power plant situated there.
20,"to prevent further consequences of a break-down which took several hundred human lives and contaminated vast areas, a sarcophagus was built around the destroyed reactor."
20,the main problem is that the sarcophagus is not tight and does not prevent ground water contamination.
20,the risk for collapse of its roof is also very serious.
20,if this will happen a radiation disaster could be foretold with incalculable consequences.
20,"in waiting for a definite technical solution of the cernobyl problem, a careful monitoring of the plant area and especially the sarcophagus had to be performed."
20,the establishment of an automatic measuring system for continuous information gathering is necessary.
20,the system should consist of the following subsystems: (1) a gps-system for continuous deformation monitoring of the structure with the sarcophagus.
20,(2) a photogrammetrical system for continuous control of the sarcophagus and the “junk-yard” in the vicinity (containing radioactive waste and scrap including helicopters which were used during the rescue and decontamination operations at chernobyl).
20,(3) airborne remote sensing for the detection of environmental pollution and industrial disposals in ground and water.
20,the use of gps technology will give large advantages.
20,the requirement of sight between the measurement points will be eliminated and the process is weather independent.
20,three dimensional coordinates is achieved in a very short time.
20,another important factor is the costs which will be low compared with classical methods of deformation measurement.
20,"the system will be able to detect absolute movements of about 2 – 3 mm in three dimensions, if reference points are situated not more than 30 kilometres of each other."
20,the word “deformation” is here interpreted as both changes in the object geometry in regard to its original state and shifts in the entire object in regard to its surroundings.
20,"deformations, regardless of reason, are always of a geometrical type."
20,the major research tasks for the proposed system should be: (1) identification of systematical error sources and development of methods for elimination of the influence of the errors on the measurement results.
21,"kybernetes (2) development of mathematical models for deformation determination 31,2 with gps."
21,(3) computer simulation of the object’s deformation and estimation of the accuracy for different models with respect to deformation determination.
21,(4) development of tools for integration of gps with terrestrial geodetic and 240 geotechnical measurements.
21,"(5) elaboration of methods for interpretation, prediction and 4d visualisation of deformation of objects."
21,"(6) design, establishment and field test of a computer system for continuos deformation monitoring with gps."
21,a drawing of principle for the proposed system is shown in figure 1.
21,figure 2 shows its main subsystems.
21,the photogrammetry part of the system also has some major advantages.
21,"the camera, for example, has no need for a position on a stable platform, as is the case when geodetical instruments are used."
21,this allows for photography being taken from the most advantageous location.
21,the system should perform the following tasks: figure 1.
21,a gps system for monitoring of the chernobyl site
22,monitoring and early warning systems 241 figure 2.
22,main subsystems of the system shown in figure 1 (1) digital stereo-image acquisition.
22,"(2) image evaluation – orientation of digital image pairs, image matching, computation of digital elevation models and, 3d coordinates for all targets established on the sarcophagus and junk-yard."
22,(3) comparison of results obtained for different measurement epochs in order to determine the changes of the objects.
22,(4) graphical presentation of the results.
22,(5) achieving and storage of the data.
22,"the main software function should be the data flow control between cameras, image memory, computer memory and data storage."
22,"image quality can be tested, using tools for histogram, line or row profiles, or zooming."
22,image acquisition should be automated.
22,the structure of the photogrammetry system is shown in figure 3.
22,"the last part of the system, airborne remote sensing, is an excellent tool for gathering information about large areas."
22,"in the chernobyl case, resolution obtained from satellite sensors is not good enough and low flying mobile vehicles had to be used as platforms for installation of rs sensors."
22,further parts of this subsystem would be gps equipment for flight
23,"kybernetes 31,2 242 figure 3."
23,hardware components of the photogrammetry system navigation and driving of the sensor platform and a fast computer with software for processing of rs data and calibration of the system.
23,"its main tasks would be: (1) creating a 3d model of the area by means of digital photogrammetry, after first flying over the area."
23,(2) by means of rs sensors collect information about; – distribution of temperature in the zone; – distribution of radioactivity; – ground water level; – environmental pollution in the water and soil; and – changes in localisation of industrial deposits.
23,(3) to create a 3d dynamic model of the area including water relations in the zone and water exchange between the restricted zone and kiev water reservoir.
23,(4) to create a mathematical model of expansion of the pollution in the future by sequential comparison of the periodical measurements.
23,principles of the airborne system is shown in figure 4.
24,monitoring and early warning systems 243 figure 4.
24,airborne system for collection of information embedded in the process should be temperature and strain measurements for mass concrete temperature changes as well as soil and water temperature changes.
24,data from piezometric pressure in shear zone in foundation rock at concrete/rock interface and adjacent to penstock should also be valuable.
24,"conclusions design of systems for gathering of information about risk areas, which can be affected by environmental catastrophes, plays a very important role in the process of recognition and prediction of environmental changes."
24,"there are a great number of such areas on the earth, and many of them have already been affected by catastrophes."
24,one of the most critical is the chernobyl area where we have to act quickly and collectively in order to prevent further disasters.
25,"kybernetes the first and most urgent action here is to establish an automated system 31,2 for monitoring which gives the possibility for early warnings."
25,"the main requirements for the design of such a system are: . digital data collection and processing; . automation and real-time access to the results; 244 . compatibility and integration of different types of data from multisensors and/or existing databases; . possibility to easily modify the system by accommodating additional instrumentation and/or installation of new software; . continuous storage and archiving of data; . prediction of events, depending on different scenarios of acting forces; . early warning procedures as part of the system; . visualization of dynamic information; and . quick distribution of results."
25,"interdisciplinary team work, global analysis of all observations and, digital data collection are the key words which describe in a short way a modern system for surveillance of risk areas."
