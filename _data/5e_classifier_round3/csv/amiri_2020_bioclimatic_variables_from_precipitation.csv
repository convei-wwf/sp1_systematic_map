1,"the variables were employed to predict the distribution of artemisia sieberi in central iran through five species distribution models (sdms) such as generalized linear model (glm), random forest (rf), classification tree analysis (cta), multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars), and maximum entropy (maxent)."

1,the results obtained from independent sample t-test on aucratio values derived from the correlative models showed that it had more satisfactory results when they were getting from the data of scenario ii than the scenario i (p < .01).
1,"rf scored the highest partial auc values (aucratio) among the single models, and based on both scenarios, ensemble map was able to provide the most accurate predictions."
1,"there were also non-significant differences among the per- formance of rf, cta and ensemble models under two scenarios (p < .01)."
1,results emphasized the importance of bioclimatic variables derived from remote sensing to produce more up-to-date information and also to improve the predictive performance of sdms.
