1,"published on line 9 october 2006 satellite-based remote sensing is a robust, economic and efficient tool for estimating actual et from irrigated regions and for developing crop coefficient (kc) curves."
1,the technique can keywords: cover hundreds of sampled fields at a time so that large populations of et and kc can be used evapotranspiration to develop representative mean values.
1,"this paper uses a satellite remote sensing technique crop coefficient to analyse the impact of planting and development schedules of crops on et for crops of dry satellite beans, corn, potatoes, sugar beets and small grains (wheat and barley), which are major remote sensing crops in the temperate, semiarid climate of southern idaho."
1,the results indicate that early irrigation planted and developing crops consume 6–10% more water in the southern idaho environ- ment than late developing crops for most major crop types.
1,this increase occurs primarily because early developing crops tend to have a relatively longer growing period than crops developing later in spring.
1,et quantified through this procedure may have application in evaluating irrigation/project performance and in determining economic productivity of water.

8,"the et data midseason sampled from 3095 fields were analyzed among early, normal 40–450 10–15 45–50 50–55 45–60 45–50 and late development categories for the six crop types, 25 including two families of potato varieties."
8,"the results indicate that corn, sugar beet and small grain crops have similar harvest or senescence timing regardless of agrimet whether the crops begin development earlier or later than the 0.95 1.00 0.93 0.93 1.00 1.00 1.00 norm for these crops."
8,the other crops (dry beans and potatoes) exhibited similar lengths of growing periods regardless of period of rapid development.
8,"corn, small grain and dry beans average of 3 (bush variety) are determinate crops (i.e. they tend to mature 0.93 1.03 0.91 0.94 0.96 0.95 0.98 and senesce essentially independent of weather conditions) and sugar beets and many potatoes are indeterminate (these tend to require frost to terminate)."
8,"however, the timing behavior noted did not appear to relate to whether a crop was table 3 – midseason average kco and kcr values by crop type and development category with comparisons to literature values development determinate or indeterminate."
8,"in terms of 7-month total et midseason kcr from mid march to mid october, early development categories late 0.92 1.02 0.91 0.94 0.96 0.92 0.98 consumed more et than late planting groups for most crop types."
8,"compared to the late development categories, early development consumed about 85 mm season1 or 10% more water for corn, sugar beets and spring grain, and 40– development 60 mm season1 or 6–8% more water for dry beans, potatoes normal 0.92 1.03 0.91 0.94 0.96 0.96 0.98 and winter grain."
8,midseason kco and kcr were analyzed for each crop type and compared with two widely accepted literature numbers; fao56 kco and wright (1981) kcr.
