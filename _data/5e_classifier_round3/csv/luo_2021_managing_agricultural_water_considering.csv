2,"in addition, similar studies were carried out on the administrative unit and irrigation district scale."
2,"for example, li et at. determined the water allocation priority among different cities consid- ering different socioeconomic development levels and national or regional policies [11]."
2,"zhang et al. evaluated the priorities of 17 irrigation districts based on fairness, production efficiency and economic benefits, and then input them into a water resource optimization model to obtain a water resource allocation strategy [12]."
2,"however, the priority assessment system contains many spatial variability indicators, such as population, crop yield, etc."
2,"in addition, due to the limitations of data collection, it is difficult for current studies to consider smaller scales than administrative units and irrigation areas, which ignores the spatial variability of the system."
2,"with the development of “3s” technology (i.e., remote sensing, global position system, and geographic information systems), more spatial information can be collected [13]."
2,"some remote sensing data such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and land use can be directly used in water resources management practices [14,15]."
2,"for example, remote sensing data have been utilized to evaluate the efficiency of water resources utilization, and to help optimize water resources allocation [14,16]."
2,"moreover, some socioeconomic statistics can be estimated by appropriate methods and remote sensing data, which are helpful for water resources management [17]."
2,the spatial unit of the collection boundary for socio-economic statistics is usually the administrative unit boundary.
2,"there are several limitations in spatial analysis and interdisciplinary application, including low spatial resolution and a mismatch between administrative regions and geographical units."
2,"compared with traditional socio-economic data, the spatialization of statistical data has the following advantages: (1) reflecting the spatial distribution characteristics of socio-economic data within the statistical region; (2) facilitating spatial analysis through grid-based socio- economic data; and (3) breaking the limitations of administrative boundary."
2,"liang et al. used night-time light and land use data to spatialize the gdp of a chinese city via a linear regression model, which can provide a reference for future urban planning and social and economic development [18]."
2,zhao et al. utilized different regression models to spatialize the gdp of south china and analyzed the performance of different models [19].
2,sutton used night-time light data to map urban population density distribution and analyzed the trend of urban population density in the united states [20].
2,"however, most relevant studies focused to gather the spatialization of gdp and population statistical data, few attempts have been made on agricultural economic statistical data, such as grain yield and agricultural output value [21]."
2,"moreover, there are few reports on the application of statistical data spatialization methods in agricultural water management."
2,"therefore, this research attempts to construct a spatialization method of agricultural output value and grain yield."
2,"after using the obtained spatialized statistical data and remote sensing data, we can ensure that the priority evaluated on a smaller scale contains more spatial information."
2,"to formulate specific planning schemes, the priority of water users was integrated with optimization models."
2,"generally, there are conflicting allocation objectives among different users including economic, social, and environmental impacts [3]."
2,"thus, multiobjective models were developed for tackling multilateral interests from decision-makers [22–24]."
2,"in practical water-allocation problems, economic benefits, crop yield, and environmental impacts were the most common objectives, while fairness in water allocation was attracting more and more attention [25,26]."
2,zhang et al. used the gini coefficient in water distribution to quantify the fairness among different water use sectors [23].
2,li et al. measured the fairness of water distribution by the minimum difference of water use per unit area [3].
2,"these indicators were presented as a function describing the absolute individual differences, such that penalties were incurred for any differences in individual distribution results (whether a customer is worse off or better off) [27]."
2,"through such methods, interactions between allocation individuals, such as jealousy and comparison, can be hardly considered and reflected, which may reduce the resource allocation efficiency [28]."
2,envy is a measure that considers the differences in service quality between all possible pairs of customers [29].
3,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 1536 3 of 28 this fairness index, based on the jealousy value, not only considers the psychology of comparison among the allocation objects, but also effectively avoids the loss of allocation efficiency."
3,"therefore, this indicator is applied to the allocation of limited resources to consider the envy among the allocation objects in the allocation process."
3,"in order to effectively manage agricultural water resources, an evaluation-optimization framework has been developed."
3,"first, a water allocation priority evaluation system is constructed, and remote sensing data is involved."
3,"after applying this evaluation model at the canal scale, both the accuracy and spatial variability can be guaranteed in the evaluation results."
3,"then a nonlinear multi-objective optimal allocation model of agricultural land and water resources (nmolw), considering allocation efficiency and equity, was established."
3,the presented method improves the existing statistical data spatialization method and is applied to the constructed water allocation priority evaluation system.
3,"then we input the priority evaluation results into the nmolw model, and obtained the agricultural water and land resource allocation of irrigation area plan by solving the model."
3,"this can: (1) obtain the water allocation priority through considerations of the social, economic, and environmental factors at the canal scale; (2) improve the spatialization method of agricultural output value (specifically referring to the income from the planting industry) and grain yield statistical data by introduce normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) and remote sensing data on potential yield."
3,"potential yield of farmland refers to the farmland production potential estimated by the gaez (global agro ecological zones) model, considering soil, weather, the environment, and other factors [30]; and (3) illustrate the tradeoff between conflicting objectives, such as economic benefits, water supply priority, grain yield, and minimum envy."
3,the method is applied to a practical case of an irrigation district in northwest china and the optimization results can provide decision-making support for managers.
3,development of methodology 2.1.
3,"overview of the problem in agricultural production, under the constraints of limited agricultural land and water resources, formulating more effective resource utilization strategies requires us to determine the water supply priority of competing water sectors."
3,"however, the current research on the priority of water supply cannot meet the requirements of precise management of water supply in practice."
3,"for example, most previous evaluation programs were carried out on administrative units and irrigation districts, which could not take into account the actual distribution of the canal system; the previous evaluation system does not consider the spatiality of the evaluation index, which has also limited the accuracy of the evaluation plan."
3,"moreover, when allocating limited agricultural water resources, blindly pursuing distribution efficiency, such as economic benefits and grain output, will lead to an unfair distribution of water resources."
3,"thus, to use land and water resources in a more efficient and sustainable way, decision makers are faced with the following issues: (1) how to evaluate the priority of water distribution on a smaller scale according to actual needs?"
3,(2) how to resolve the conflict between the boundary of statistical data and the boundary of the new evaluation unit?
3,(3) how to balance distribution efficiency and distribution fairness in water resource distribution?
3,"especially in the case of water scarcity, managers should not only consider food production and economic benefits, but also consider the fairness of distribution and user satisfaction with the water supply."
3,"therefore, the framework developed in this study (figure 1) attempts to solve the above problems, and can be divided into three parts: (1) spatialize the statistics of agri- cultural output value and grain yield; (2) construct a water allocation priority evaluation system on the canal scale; and (3) formulate a nmlow model to obtain the irrigation water allocation."

13,"statistical regression model when establishing the regression model of agricultural output value and grain yield, we used 12 cities in inner mongolia as the research objects (figure 5)."
13,then the correlation between remote sensing impact factors and statistical data can be analyzed.
13,the results of the correlation analysis are shown in table 5.
13,table 5.
13,correlation analysis results between remote sensing impact factors and statistical data.
13,statistical data cultivated land area ndvi potential yield impact factors of farmland agricultural output value 0.93 ** 0.78 ** 0.65 * grain yield 0.87 ** 0.86 ** 0.73 ** note: ** p < 0.05; * p < 0.1.
13,"as shown in table 5, there are a strong correlation among the three factors and agricultural output value, grain yield."
13,all of them have passed the significance test.
13,"among them, the cultivated land area has a best correlation with agricultural output value and grain yield."
13,this reflects the principle that there is no agricultural output value and grain output without arable land is reasonable.
13,"in addition, the ndvi and potential yield of farmland have a good correlation with agricultural output value and grain yield, so these two factors can be used for predicting the statistical data."
13,"existing studies have shown that, in the application of remote sensing, both the single-factor nonlinear model and the multi-factor multiple linear regression model have been applied well and achieved good estimation accuracy [18,19,21]."
13,"this study not only established a single factor model with ndvi and potential yield of farmland as variables, but also a multiple regression model including these two variables."
13,then a more suitable regression model can be selected by comparing the performance.
13,"for comparison, the fitting results of all algorithms are shown in table 6."
13,statistical regression results of agricultural output value show that the model established by ndvi is better than the potential yield of farmland.
13,"among the four regression models, the power function model established by ndvi has the best fitting performance (r2 = 0.7177, f = 25.42)."
13,statistical regression results of grain yield also show that the model established by ndvi is better.
13,"among these models, the quadratic function model and the power function model established by ndvi have better fitting results."
13,"in real cases, the agricultural output value and grain yield are not supposed to be negative."
13,"however, the linear and quadratic function models are prone to negative values, while the exponential function and power function algorithm would not be negative."
13,"therefore, although the established linear model between ndvi and grain yield has a good fitting effect, we cannot select it due to the existence of negative values."
13,"in addition, considering the combined effects of ndvi and potential yield of farmland a multiple linear regression model is proposed."
13,"for preventing negative values, this study set the intercept of regression model to zero."
13,"then, a power function model of ndvi and agricultural output value, a power function model of ndvi and grain yield, a quadratic function model of ndvi and grain yield, and a multiple linear regression model were selected according to the comparison."

14,"spatialization results five county-level administrative regions (dengkou, hangjin houqi, linhe, wuyuan, and urat qianqi) in the study area were used as verification objects (figure 3)."
14,the relationship between the spatial statistical results and the actual statistical results was analyzed to verify the accuracy.
14,the results are shown in table 7.

14,"among the spatial models of agricultural output value, the precision of multiple linear regression and ndvi power function model are better than the area weighted algorithm."
14,"the ndvi power function model has the highest accuracy, and compared with the traditional method, the accuracy of this method is improved by 16%."
14,this demonstrates that introducing impact factors can improve the simulation accuracy of the spatial model compared with the traditional algorithm.
14,the error of the agricultural output value spatialization result obtained by the multiple linear regression algorithm is larger than that of the previous research [17].
14,"however, previous studies included constants in the area where multiple regression models were established, which is contrary to the understanding that there is no agricultural output value without cultivated land."
14,"as for the spatialization of grain yield, previous studies established relationships between population density, land, and grain yield [50]."
14,"however, in fact, the correlation between population density and food pro- duction is not strong, which restricts the improvement of spatialization accuracy."
14,"among the spatial models of grain yield, the multiple linear regression algorithm has the highest accuracy."
14,"according to the simulation results of grain yield, an algorithm having good fitting results does not necessarily mean high simulation accuracy."
14,this also illustrates the necessity of choosing different regression models instead of a single regression model.
14,"based on the analysis, the ndvi power function algorithm was chosen for agricul- tural output value spatialization (equation (21)), and the multiple linear regression was chosen for grain yield spatialization (equation (22))."
14,"through calculations, the statistical spatialization data was obtained."
14,"as shown in figure 7, areas with higher agricultural output value are concentrated in the central region of the hid, including hangjin houqi,"

17,existing crop irrigation water allocation schemes indicate that corn always gets more irrigation water under different available water conditions [51].
17,"corn has a greater planting advantage in hid, because corn yield and economic benefit are higher than those of wheat."
17,"sunflowers have more non-irrigated areas than wheat, because managers pay more attention to food production."
17,"however, the reduction of guaranteed sunflower irrigation area will decrease farmers’ economic income."
17,"therefore, when the irrigation area requires to ensure the grain yield under water shortage, it is needed to compensate farmers’ economic losses."

18,"moreover, it can be found that hid currently has a large sunflower planting ratio, but the existing water resources cannot guarantee irrigation in so many areas."

20,gross primary productivity is highly correlated with biological productivity and com- monly used in crop yield estimations [52].
20,"therefore, future studies should explore the use of gross primary productivity."
20,"overall, this is likely to enhance the accuracy of the estimation by improving the availability and quality of statistical data and remote sensing data, introducing multi-source data, such as planting structure data."

20,"single-objective models with minimum envy fairness (equation (10)) and gini coefficient (equation (23)) are established, which have the same constraints as the nmolw model."
20,"water supply satisfaction, economic benefit, and grain yield are selected as indicators for assessing the performance of the two models."
20,"the calculation function of water supply satisfaction is shown in equation (24): i k mai mak ∑∑ ai − a k i k mingini = (23) i 2i ∑ maai i i i mai p=∑ (24) i mei as shown in table 10, minimum envy fairness results in higher food production and economic benefits."
20,"when the optimization results of gini coefficient are used they show that the greater the water demand, the higher the degree of dissatisfaction."
20,"moreover, this study suggests that the minimum envy fairness should not be used alone when a significant water demand difference exist among users, but should be combined with other methods for constructing the fairness index."
20,minimum envy fairness well reflects the comparison and jealousy among water users.
20,"in addition, the minimum envy fairness can also be used to consider the distribution from the perspective of demand, avoiding efficiency loss."
20,the gini coefficient cannot consider these factors in practical resources allocation problems [27].

21,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 1536 21 of 28 this paper is more suitable for the main grain producing areas planted as one-year crops."
21,"therefore, how to measure the impact of different cropping systems on the spatialization of agricultural economic statistics is also a topic that we need to give attention to in the future."
21,"in addition, the nmolw model pays more attention to socio-economic goals, but involves insufficient consideration of ecological aspects."
21,"moreover, because of the limitations of the data collection, the factors considered in the evaluation of water allocation priority are limited, which affects the evaluation accuracy."
21,these should be addressed in future work.
21,"conclusions to determine the water allocation priority and manage agricultural water effectively, this study carried out the water allocation priority evaluation, and then a nmolw model was proposed for considering fairness and efficiency."
21,the water supply response units were divided according to the practical water supply condition of the study area.
21,"furthermore, in order to solve the boundary conflict between the response unit and the original statistical data, a spatial method of analyzing the statistical data was introduced."
21,this study has the following advantages:(1) improving the spatial simulation accuracy agricultural output value and grain yield; (2) measuring the precise priorities including more spatial informa- tion; (3) fully considering the tradeoffs between allocation efficiency and equity; and (4) providing decision-making support for irrigation districts to formulate water use plans.
21,"to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach, this method has been applied to hid."
21,the results show that: (1) the spatialization method of grain yield and agricultural production value achieved good simulation accuracy in hid; (2) we can determine the priority of water allocation at the scale of the canal system in hid; and (3) there is still room for increasing grain output in hid.
21,the approach proposed in this study is expected to support sustainable agricultural water management in similar regions.
21,"in fact, due to the variability of water supply response unit division and evaluating indexes, the method can be changed to suit different regions."
21,"there are many factors affecting the spatial distribution of agricultural output value and grain yield statistics, such as the detailed planting structure."
21,these spatialization methods can be further improved.
