1,advances induced by digital innovation have positively impacted this sector and could have a considerable impact by reducing the risk of food insecurity.
1,"in this chapter, applied research experiences conducted in morocco have been reported to highlight some of the opportunities that digital transformation can offer in agriculture."
1,"first, agricultural land management was approached through remote monitoring of agricultural land and mapping of cropland using satellite imageries and machine learning."
1,"then, the question of what digital can offer for the management of agricultural water resources was discussed through two examples: the first deals with the use of remote sensing and modeling to support irrigation water management; and the second is related to another aspect of multi-year bioeconomic modeling for predicting changes in water management indicators."
1,"finally, experiences on the importance of digital transfor- mation in risk management were discussed in order to analyze the risks in a more informed way and to relate aspects that could not be connected before in the past, in an efficient and relevant manner."
1,"indeed, an experiment on the evaluation of spatial variability of wheat yield has been reported and an example of the spatial analysis of risk related to losses in production value using satellite data was discussed."

2,"overall, all of the experiences cited on the use of digital innovation in the agriculture sector can be extended to other contexts, particularly in africa where sustainable agricultural development remains the ultimate goal."

2,it would facilitate the participation of stakeholders in an eco- responsible strategy that meets sustainable development goals (sdgs) (elmassah and mohieldin 2020).
2,"in agriculture, in order to make informed and sustainable decisions, unmanned aerial vehicles or drones (uavs), for example, can allow farmers to better map fields and thus get to know precisely which places need water or nitrogen (talaviya et al."
2,2020).
2,"likewise, software uses data on the climate, crop control, seasonal forecasts and local specifics to achieve better yields in a sustainable manner (peng et al."
2,2018).
2,"in general, ‘digitization of agriculture’ refers to the use of information and commu- nication technologies (ict) in addition to new digital technologies (el bilali and allahyari 2018)."
2,"these include, for example, videos, radio, television, internet, remote detection, digital broadcasting, the use of smartphones (mobile agriculture, also called m-agri), artificial intelligence, etc."
2,"all these technologies make it possible to not only access, store, transfer and manipulate information, but also to analyze it and give it a meaning, in order to transform agriculture into a more modern, profitable, and sustainable sector."
2,"nevertheless, the massive introduction of digiti- zation has significantly impacted the organization of work and jobs (dorn 2017)."
2,"in some cases, it is responsible for job destruction and rising unemployment, while in others it essentially creates new activities and stimulates the economy (brasseur and biaz 2018)."
2,the success of digitization in other sectors has encouraged its adoption in agriculture around the world and also reflects the new expectations of farmers.
2,"however, the introduction of technology into the system that farmers form with their environment risks overturning it and making technology a problem rather than a solution."
2,"in africa, where agriculture is a strategic activity for many countries (fig. 1), the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, despite everything, is an opportunity to promote its socio-economic development and keep its commitments to achieve sdgs (hinson et al."
2,2019).

3,1 socio-economic importance of agriculture in africa.
3,average 1991–2020 calculated based on the world bank data.
3,"source world bank (2021a) located in the north western part of africa, morocco has been endowed with the green morocco plan (gmp) during the period 2008–2020 as an ambitious agricul- tural strategy, which provided a clear and precise roadmap, giving a new impetus to the country’s agricultural sector (lionboui et al. 2020b)."
3,"in such a policy framework, the contribution of digital technology to the governance of agricultural sector, like other sectors, has shown its effectiveness in the monitoring and evaluation of the various actions."
3,"thus, digital technologies had made it possible to report actions carried out in the field and to have centralized dashboards with a view to steering and monitoring the agricultural policy (gmp) impact indicators."
3,"in fact, the moroccan ministry of agriculture has set up several programs during the implementation of gmp, including the national register of farmers, the system of agricultural aid and subsidies (saba), the agricultural gis, the market price monitoring system (asaâr), the international market monitoring system (eacce), the crop growth monitoring system-maroc (cgms-maroc), and the irrigation warning system."
3,"the gmp, which expired in 2020, has generally produced tangible results (treguer and pachon 2019)."
3,"based on the globalization of trade and its fluidity, this plan has favored certain export sectors (early vegetables, citrus fruits, olive oil) allowing the country to acquire foreign currency."
3,"however, it has not been able to ensure a noticeable increase in the production of basic foodstuffs like cereals, pulses, milk,"

4,"during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, evidence shows that countries dependent on imports of basic foodstuffs are the most affected (alvaro et al."
4,2020).
4,hence the importance of reviewing the country’s agricultural choices with regard to its food security.
4,"this context coincided with the launch of a new strategy for the next ten years, called ‘green generation 2020–2030’, which provides solutions for the revitalization of the agricultural sector in order to improve food security and make rural areas more attractive."
4,"this agricultural strategy aims at facilitating the emergence of a new generation of agricultural middle class through the consolidation of the gains made in the agricultural sector and the creation of new activities generating jobs and income, particularly for young people in rural areas."
4,the digital transformation of the agricultural sector is also one of the main objectives of this new strategy.
4,this strategy includes the digitization of the agricultural support system granted through the agricultural development fund (fda).
4,this digitization has accelerated within the framework of the health provisions related to covid-19 pandemic with the establishment of an electronic platform dedicated to the submission of grant application files.
4,"in the area of scientific research, there is not enough published research on digi- tization policies (trendov et al."
4,2019).
4,"nevertheless, a lot of work from a technical point of view exists in the international literature on the different forms of digitiza- tion in agriculture (klerkx et al."
4,2019).
4,"the digitization of agriculture is, therefore, a very topical issue and offers many solutions – such as weather forecasting, irriga- tion planning, plant disease control, market organization, information on agricultural extension services…—to the questions we are making today about climate change, agriculture, and sustainable food security."
4,"this is where this chapter intends to make a contribution, by providing an overview of some examples of research carried out in morocco, and which may constitute a step towards the development of agriculture in africa."
4,an exploratory review of the literature shows that three thematic groups on digitization in agriculture can be identified: agricultural land management; agri- cultural risk management; and agricultural water management.
4,"these themes, which offer a large margin for a future multidisciplinary science on digital agriculture, will be developed in this chapter in order to show the results already achieved and the challenges still open for the development of the agricultural sector."
4,"2 digital agricultural land management sustainable management of agricultural land is fundamental to food security around the world, especially in the context of climate change and increasingly unpredictable weather conditions (misra 2014)."
4,"in the african continent, sustainable land manage- ment is at the heart of the development challenge (emerton and snyder 2018)."
4,"the introduction of digital innovation in the management of agricultural land can help increase agricultural production and strengthen food security in africa, including morocco."
4,"indeed, land degradation in this country impedes agricultural growth and increases the poverty and vulnerability of rural populations (kouba et al."
4,2018).
5,"16 digitalization and agricultural development: evidence from morocco 325 this, the digital transformation of agricultural sector could constitute a major lever for improving the management of agricultural land and minimizing the impact of this degradation on the economic growth of agriculture."
5,sustainable land management is a holistic approach that involves several disci- plines and has the potential for sustainable transformation in the short and long terms.
5,"the goal here is, in particular, to identify, analyze, and discuss promising experiences adapted to the specificity of the african continent while including digital to promote the management of agricultural land."
5,"2.1 remote monitoring of agricultural land monitoring agricultural land is a very complex task for african countries, espe- cially in arid and semi-arid regions where water scarcity and droughts are common."
5,"however, even if field data collection is a time-consuming and expensive task, large-scale information on farming systems is essential for decision-makers to better manage agricultural land."
5,digital innovation has shown its ability to offer solutions that can facilitate better decision-making regarding livelihoods and food production and security.
5,"two studies conducted in the oum er rbia river basin in morocco by lebrini et al. (2020) and lebrini et al. (2019), have confirmed this digital innovation capacity."
5,"in this research, remote monitoring of agricultural land was carried out using satellite data and machine-learning methods."
5,"on the one hand, the authors assessed the performance of machine learning methods in mapping agricultural systems at large spatial scales using phenological metrics derived from long-term spatial remote sensing data acquired by modis sensor."
5,"on the other hand, they studied the spatial and temporal changes between the four classes of agricultural systems in the studied region (fig."
5,"to do this, the timesat software (jönsson and eklundh 2004) was used for both filtering noisy ndvi time series and extracting the main phenological metrics for each fig."

6,"afterwards, the produced metrics were used through three machine learning classifiers based on the caret package of r (kuhn 2008) for land classification."
6,the accuracy of each classifier results was ensured using ground reference data collected through a fieldwork during the 2015–2016 season and from google earth images for the rest of series.
6,"the four identified classes of land cover were: irrigated perennial crops, irri- gated annual crops, rainfed areas, and fallow land."
6,the authors found that the random forest classifier produced satisfactory results on mapping and monitoring the mentioned agricultural systems.
6,"finally, a land cover change analysis was performed to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics between the selected land cover classes in the studied area."
6,the results of this study are encouraging since they can inform the dynamics and the effect of regional policy on changes in agricultural systems at the spatial scale over a longer or shorter period.
6,this can represent for decision-makers a precise and inex- pensive tool for the management of agricultural land in the context of environmental and climatic changes.
6,2.2 cropland classification using a machine learning approach the classification of cropland and crop types is very important for monitoring land use and land cover.
6,"nonetheless, land use is a changing reality."
6,"indeed, plants are subject to natural laws of lifespan, in addition to a large category of crops also obeying cultural principles based on crops rotation for better production and maintenance of crop soil fertility (baldivieso-freitas et al."
6,2018).
6,"usually, information on crop rota- tion types and their areas is done in the conventional way through extensive census and ground surveys, which makes the process both expensive and time-consuming."
6,remote sensing can offer cost-effective solutions that can facilitate the collection and standardization of data.
6,"in the same logic, we present, in this part, a research experience carried out in morocco by htitiou et al. (2019, 2020) that can be very useful for monitoring agricultural activity using a machine learning approach."
6,this research mainly aims to compare and identify the potential of sentinel-2 (s2) and landsat-8 (l8) multi-temporal data to identify different crop types over a heteroge- neous agricultural area.
6,"indeed, the spectral reflectance of a field varies depending on the phenological stage of each type of crop as well as other factors such as their phytosanitary state."
6,the integration of these types of data increases the information available to distinguish between the spectral signatures of each crop class for a more efficient classification.
6,"for this, various phenological information were derived from ndvi time series in order to explore key variables to identify both cropland and crop types."
6,"indeed, 10 feature sets were developed and evaluated to discriminate different types of crops via the rf classifier based on derived sentinel-2 phenological metrics and smoothed"

7,the results showed that the combined use of the adjusted iv and the phenological characteristics gave the best performance.
7,"additionally, the result of using the optimal features was the most accurate among the 10 feature sets, with an overall accuracy of 88% and a kappa of 0.84."
7,"in addition to providing a synoptic view, this research constitutes a considerable contribution in the iden- tification of crop types, with a view to ensuring the efficient management of the agricultural sector during the growing season based on updated information."
7,"in order to improve the temporal datasets frequency for crop type classification in high heterogeneous context, htitiou et al. (2019, 2020) assessed the quality of various fusion models to take advantage of the combined use between s2 and l8 images."
7,"compared to the standard methods of spatiotemporal data fusion (starfm and fsdaf), mapping results from the very deep super-resolution (vdsr) method performs well."
7,these approaches can be successfully applied to other edapho-climatic contexts in africa.
7,"in addition, improvements and adjustments could be made to improve the accuracy of the results depending on the context of each area studied, in particular with the launch of the european sentinel-2b sensor and the upcoming landsat-9 (proposed for launch in middle 2021), which will substantially increase moderate- resolution satellite observations available for agricultural monitoring."
7,these new advances will improve the quality of cultivated land maps in heterogeneous agricultural areas and facilitate the decision-making process.

8,3 using digital in water resource management water resources have become increasingly scarce in a context where the gap between water supply and demand continues to widen sharply in morocco and other north- african countries (schilling et al.
8,2020).
8,"furthermore, non-rational use of irrigation water resources constitutes a major constraint to development in agricultural areas (lionboui et al. 2016a)."
8,"a better valuation and adoption of more water-efficient prac- tices are becoming increasingly necessary, especially in arid and semi-arid regions."
8,"encouraged by the orientation of the implemented agricultural policy (gmp) during the study period in terms of water saving, the research presented in this section offers methodological frameworks for managing and organizing the control and allocation of water resources, thus ensuring their protection and conservation."
8,3.1 support irrigation water management using spatial remote sensing and modeling the scientific advances made possible by the use of satellites in the field of moni- toring the moisture content of crops are not a new phenomenon.
8,"indeed, when there is not enough water and the crop is under water stress, it no longer manages to lose heat quickly enough through perspiration, which increases its temperature."
8,remote sensing can detect this using heat-sensitive electromagnetic spectra.
8,"in addi- tion, it provides very frequent data, which allows the evolution of processes on a spatiotemporal scale to be closely followed."
8,"in the experiment carried out by benabdelouahab et al. (2019b) in the tadla irrigation perimeter (center of morocco), remotely-sensed reflectance was used to estimate the water content of soil and vegetation for various crops and to monitor water irrigation per unit of surface, relying on the high temporal and spatial resolu- tion of satellite images."
8,"in this study, the capacity of two spectral indices (ndwirog and msi), derived from spot-5 images and backscatter values derived from sar images, was evaluated."
8,"then, these indices were compared with the corresponding in situ measurements of soil moisture and vegetation water content in 30 plots sown with wheat, with which they showed a strong correlation."
8,the results of this research stipulate that the ndwirog index could be used as an operational index for moni- toring irrigation during the main stages of crop growth at field and regional level in the tadla irrigation scheme.
8,"in another step, remote sensing was combined with the field crop growth model (aquacrop v4.0) developed by the food and agriculture organization (fao), to provide an operational tool for irrigation and crop manage- ment."
8,"under the conditions of the tadla irrigation scheme, aquacrop was adjusted and tested to simulate the impact of irrigation on durum wheat yields."
8,analysis of irrigation scenarios has shown that the model can optimize the frequency and timing of irrigation water supplies.
8,this could promote the efficiency of water use and guarantee optimal growing conditions during the different stages of the crop.
9,16 digitalization and agricultural development: evidence from morocco 329 the approach presented is an important step towards the establishment of an effective irrigation management system to assist decision makers and managers in planning irrigation supplies.
9,"however, this approach must be verified before judging its suitability for application in other regions and for other crops."
9,"for this, new perspectives for improving crop modeling, by integrating weather forecasting into the decision process and by adopting spatial modeling using data layers on a grid format derived from satellite data, are important."
9,3.2 predict changes in water management indicators using multi-year agro-economic modeling modeling is a representation of the information necessary for a decision-making process such as water resource management.
9,information related to a natural resource such as water is variable over time and space and depends on several factors.
9,"for this, the modeling of such resource can present many solutions by being part of an exhaustive vision of management and monitoring of irrigation water."
9,"such a vision may integrate the agronomic, economic, and hydrological dimensions in the analysis of the management of this resource in the regions under study."
9,"the example presented here focused on the case of tadla sub-basin in central morocco, where a marked decrease in the supply of irrigation water is noticed (lion- boui et al."
9,2018).
9,the aim of this work is to analyze water resource sustainability in the current context of agricultural policies by estimating the likely changes in water management parameters and in the sensitivity of the agricultural sector to possible external shocks.
9,"given the multidimensional nature of water management, this research presents integrated agronomic, economic, and hydrological modeling for the tadla sub-basin, which classifies agricultural areas according to different sources of irrigation water (fig."
9,"to feed the database of this modeling framework and to give a clear idea about the agro-economic system functioning underlying the current water management in the study area, technico-economic efficiency and water valuation were character- ized through the study of the main agricultural crops in the tadla region."
9,"hence, the technico-economic efficiency was analyzed for the tadla farms using the data envelopment analysis method (dea) (lionboui et al. 2016b)."
9,the characteriza- tion of the agro-economic system was followed by a modeling of this system and then by an analysis of water management in the study area.
9,"the proposed model is disaggregated by territorial unit, municipalities, water irrigation sources, and by crops."
9,this tool allows decision-makers to predict the inter-annual variations of selected socio-economic indicators of water management according to different scenarios.
9,"to test the sensitivity of water valuation to external shocks, the impact of an increase in the equilibrium rate of irrigation water applied to surface water at the level of the irrigated perimeter of tadla was simulated."
9,"then, another type of exogenous shocks"

10,4 the disaggregation levels of the proposed water management modeling framework relating to climate change was simulated in order to examine their potential impacts on the long-term agricultural water management in the region (lionboui et al.
10,2018).
10,among the main results of this research is irrigation water shadow price which reflects water scarcity.
10,"it is around 0.15 us $/m3 in the tadla sub-basin, which means that irrigation water is underpaid, since its equilibrium price, paid in this region, is only usd0.04 m3 (lionboui et al. 2016a)."
10,the developed model can constitute a tool for analysis and decision-making support in terms of political choices concerning the allocation of water resources and allows an assessment of water valuation at the scale of the tadla basin.
10,"finally, this research provides a viable modeling framework for sustainable water resource management, applicable to other agro-climatic contexts, in order to help decision-makers improve irrigation water management and mitigate the exogenous shocks’ effects on the sustainability of the system."
10,"4 digital transformation and risk management agriculture must face climatic, health, economic, and environmental risks which can have consequences on the viability of agricultural activity."
10,"in order to increase the resilience of agricultural systems and minimize the impacts, particularly socio- economic, of these risks, digital technology can support the agricultural sector towards better risk management by providing reliable and quality strategic indicators, which are decisive in decision-making."
10,"thus, digital transformation is now shaping"
11,16 digitalization and agricultural development: evidence from morocco 331 up to be a real necessity to identify risk areas in order to improve the competitiveness of farms in a context of growing risks.
11,4.1 assessment of spatial variability of wheat yield using remote sensing crop yields variability has been extensively studied in the world literature in rela- tion to several factors such as soil and climate.
11,"the analysis of yields, generally measured on small elementary areas of a few m2 , conventionally assumes the statis- tical independence of observations (carter et al."
11,1983; snedecor and cochran 1980).
11,"however, given the strong interactions between yields and other factors, the validity of this basic assumption seems very problematic."
11,"indeed, risk in agriculture is now one of the most important elements to be taken into consideration in the overall management of a farm."
11,"this example offers an opportunity to meet the needs of current agricultural poli- cies (gmp and green generation) in which morocco has put in place instruments for monitoring the productivity of agricultural land, in particular for cereals, which constitute a fundamental element of the country’s food security."
11,digital innovation can provide important tools for monitoring the variability of yields in order to opti- mize the profitability of farms in a risky environment.
11,"thus, a study on the spatial variability of yields was carried out by benabdelouahab et al. (2019a) using spatial remote sensing as a data source to understand the variability of wheat yields in morocco."
11,"based on sixteen-year phenological parameters (2000–2016), a yield esti- mation model was developed."
11,phenological metrics were derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis)/ndvi data.
11,"in addition to devel- oping the yield estimation model, a spatio-temporal analysis of variability and anal- ysis of wheat yield trends were carried out for the main cereal areas in morocco (fig."
11,the historical data used in this study contain 400 records of wheat grain yield estimated at the level of the plots sampled by the department of strategy and statistics in morocco for the period 2000/2016.
11,random and stratified sampling was adopted in the selection of plots in order to guarantee the spatial representativeness of rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas.
11,"the model developed showed a good correlation with the field data (r2 and rmse were 0.62 (p < 0.01), 4.01 qs/ha, respectively)."
11,"the results of the spatial variability analysis showed an increase in the instability of wheat grain yields in the central and southern regions, especially in the rainfed areas which represent more than 51% of the cultivated area."
11,"nevertheless, irrigated areas have shown a positive trend in wheat production mainly linked to irrigation and technological improvement that the country has been experiencing for years (fig."
11,"the approach taken in this research overcomes missing data on weather, soil, and irrigation by providing quality data at a spatial scale, which reflects production conditions including physical or human factors."

12,"in addi- tion, it constitutes an inexpensive decision-making aid tool that allows managers and decision-makers to analyse the impact of an agricultural policy, to monitor the dynamics of agronomic potential at the spatial scale, and optimize the choices of agricultural land use."
12,"4.2 spatial analysis of the risk related to losses of wheat production value using satellite data for many africans, the ability to access sufficient, nutritious, and safe food capable of meeting their dietary needs has been diminished by a succession of natural disasters and epidemics."
12,"currently, among the crucial questions that arise is: in addition to climatic conditions, how to support food security in africa in the era of covid-19 pandemic, especially with uncooperative trade policies on global food markets?"
12,"in morocco, wheat production is particularly vulnerable to climate change dynamics and fluctuates from year to year."
12,"considered a dry year, the year 2020 was marked by a major drop in cereal production of 57% compared to an average"
13,16 digitalization and agricultural development: evidence from morocco 333 fig.
13,6 trend of wheat production in the main agricultural areas (2001 to 2016).
13,"source developed by the authors year in last ten years (17.7 million qx of soft wheat; 7.9 million qx of durum wheat and 6.4 million qx of barley) (mapmdref 2020), particularly wheat, which poses major challenges for the country given the food security challenge, especially in the context of covid-19 pandemic."
13,"hence the need to come up with innovative approaches, particularly digital ones, which could help design measures and increase food security at the country level. through an innovative approach that uses digital innovation, the experiment conducted by lionboui et al. (2020a) is a contribution which aims to analyse the risks of losses in wheat production value with a view to helping decision-makers to develop a risk management strategy and achieve an optimal level of socio-economic security."
13,the study looked at thirty-four provinces at the kingdom level representing about 70% of the total area sown to wheat.
13,"in order to achieve the objective assigned to this research, the adopted methodology used data from remote sensing in addition to field data."
13,"on the one hand, a new index (pv_i) has been developed to estimate the intensity of the risk related to losses in production value on a spatial scale."
13,"on the other hand, the probability of occurrence of the risk of losses in wheat production value was calculated for sixteen crop years (2001–2016) (fig."

14,lionboui et al.
14,"7 risk of losses in wheat production value in agricultural areas to perform calculations, wheat yield was estimated from its phenological param- eters as detailed in the previous section, in order to overcome the variability of the farm income risk caused by the growth phase shifts over time and in space and by technological differences between production units (benabdelouahab et al., 2019a)."
14,"in order to make significant the market prices of wheat over time for making compar- isons in the studied period, constant prices were calculated."
14,"then, the value of the annual wheat production was calculated spatially by multiplying the estimated annual yield per pixel and the calculated constant annual price of wheat in the corresponding province."
14,"overall, the results allow us to analyse variability and estimate the severity of differences in terms of the value of wheat production in the provinces studied."
14,the results showed that the value of wheat production varied from one agricultural region to another over the years studied.
14,"its average value is us$533,51/ha calculated for the period 2001–2016, with great variability, i.e. a standard deviation of us$180,14/ha."
14,"in addition, four categories of agricultural areas according to their level of risk of losses in wheat production value have been identified: • areas that present a risk of losses in wheat production value with low frequency and severity (45.34% of the total study area);"
15,16 digitalization and agricultural development: evidence from morocco 335 • areas with a risk of losses in wheat production value with low frequency and high severity (2.7% of the total study area); • risk areas with high frequency and low severity (31.83% of the total study area); and • areas with a high risk of frequency and severity (20.13% of the total area of the study).
15,this last category is the most affected area and requires urgent intervention by agricultural policies to ensure socio-economic viability and fight against rural exodus.
15,"by using digital innovation, this research offers a global and quantified view of the risks related to losses of production value and makes it possible to detect spatio- temporal differences."
15,"in order to prevent risks, the approach adopted could be applied in other context especially in africa and constitute a basis to help policy makers and producers identify and reduce unacceptable losses in production value and ensure agricultural activity sustainability."
15,"5 conclusion due to several factors, people in africa live on the brink of food insecurity."
15,"to face such a challenge, decision-makers should prioritize actions aimed at reducing the risks to food security."
15,"fostering digital innovations in agriculture could present a real solution and would be much less costly than frequent disaster relief and action, both for human lives and for the development of socio-economic conditions in the agricultural sector."
15,"in this chapter, examples of scientific research in morocco were presented, where digital technology continues to develop and guide decision-making in the agricultural sector."
15,"for years, morocco have taken preventive measures to protect its food supply by increasing the productivity of crops and reducing their sensitivity to adverse climatic conditions."
15,"indeed, adaptation to climate change is essential to preserve the achievements that morocco has accomplished in recent decades thanks to the considerable efforts of its ministry of agriculture and its partners in the economic and social development of the agricultural sector."
15,"however, due to several environmental, financial, human, and technical factors, this adaptation remains difficult."
15,"digital innovation can offer even more advantages for analysing, with preci- sion, the current situation of the agricultural sector, making forecasts by considering climate change and agricultural policies and proposing the necessary measures to ensure the development of the agricultural sector and favourable socio-economic conditions for rural population."
15,"nonetheless, farmers are still less involved, hence the importance of adopting participatory approaches."
15,"in addition, the problem of illit- eracy in rural areas, 60.1% for women and 34.9% for men (hcp 2018), makes the situation more delicate since the acquisition of digital data requires the use of social networks by farmers, which seems to be expanding rapidly, but whose development remains conditioned by their access to these technologies."

16,"whether in terms of management of agricultural land, water resources or agri- cultural risk, the experiences carried out in morocco can constitute a basis for the emergence of other digital initiatives and could be applied in different contexts, particularly in africa."
16,"in order to benefit from this research, it is important to broaden the application of the proposed approaches to other crops and regions."
16,"in addition, the launch of new sensors could contribute to the strengthening and relevance of the proposed tools by ensuring regularly updated agricultural land monitoring."
16,these new advances could improve the effectiveness of the approaches presented and potentially benefit the decision-making process.
16,"in this quest for performance, digital transformation is now seen as a real necessity in order to develop agriculture."
16,"however, the sector must acquire the human skills and technical capacities necessary for data management in order to provide a shared and more agile vision of reality to making more informed decisions."
