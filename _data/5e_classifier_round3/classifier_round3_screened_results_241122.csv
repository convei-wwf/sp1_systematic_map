Disaster Management And Virtual Globes: A High Potential For Developing Countries,"Today, the added value of geoinformation for crisis management is well known and accepted. However, experiences show that disaster management units on local administrative levels in the developing world often lack the use of Geographic Information Systems for analysing spatial interrelations and making their own maps. Various studies mention the shortage of financial resources, human capacity, and adequate knowledge as reasons for that. In recent years publically available virtual globes like Google Earth (TM), Microsoft (R) Bing T Maps 3D or Nasa World Wind enjoy great popularity. The accessibility of worldwide high resolution satellite data, their intuitive user interface, and the ability to integrate own data support this success. In this chapter, the potential of these new geospatial technologies for supporting disaster preparedness and response is demonstrated, using the example of Google Earth T. Possibilities for the integration of data layers from third parties, the digitization of own layers, as well as the analytical capacities are examined. Furthermore, a printing module is presented, which supports the production of paper maps based on data previously collected and edited in Google Earth T. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a disaster management scenario in Legazpi, a Philippine city exposed to several natural hazards due to the vicinity to Mayon volcano and the annually occuring typhoons in the region. With this research, current technological trends in geospatial technologies are taken up and investigated on their potential for professional use. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by using freely available software general constraints for using GIS in developing countries can be overcome. Most importantly, the approach presented guarantees low cost for implementation and reproducibility, which is essential for its application in developing countries.",NA,NA,10.4018/978-1-4666-2038-4.ch095,included,NA
The Utility Of Airborne Hyperspectral And Satellite Multispectral Images In Identifying Natura 2000 Non-Forest Habitats For Conservation Purposes,"Aerial hyperspectral and multispectral satellite data are the two most commonly used datasets to identify natural and semi-natural vegetation. However, there is no documented analysis based on data from several areas concerning the difference in the classification accuracy of non-forest Natura 2000 habitat with the use of aerial hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data. Also, there is no recommendation, on which habitat can be classified with sufficient accuracy using free multispectral images. This study aimed to analyse the difference in classification accuracy of Natura 2000 habitats representing: meadows, grasslands, heaths and mires between data with different spectral resolutions and the results utility for nature conservation compared to conventional maps. The analysis was conducted in five study areas in Poland. The classification was performed on multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) and hyperspectral HySpex (HS) images using the Random Forest algorithm. Based on the results, it can be stated that the use of HS data resulted in higher classification accuracy, on average 0.14, than using S2 images, regardless of the area of the habitat. However, the difference in accuracy was not constant, varying by area and habitat characterisation. Greater differences in accuracy were observed for areas where habitats were characterised by high alpha-diversity or beta-diversity. The HS and S2 data make it possible to create maps that provide a great deal of new knowledge about the distribution of Natura 2000 habitats, which is necessary for the management of protected areas. The obtained results indicate that by using S2 images it is possible to identify, at a satisfactory level, alluvial meadows and grassland. For heaths and mires, using HS data improved the results, but it is also possible to acquire general distribution of these classes, whereas HS images are obligatory for mapping salt, Molinia and lowland hay meadows.",NA,NA,10.1038/s41598-023-31705-6,included,NA
"Mapping Of Environmental Sensitivity Index To Oil Spill From Landsat Tm Images: ""A Study Case On The Amazon Coastal Plain""","The environmental sensitivity index (ESI) is represented by a scale ranging from 1 to 10, where the intensity of the impact caused by the oil spill is specified and, the higher the value the higher the sensitivity index. Oil spills impact the environment and are not exclusive to certain regions of the world. Therefore, the production of maps representing the ESI has become important for the implementation of contingency and emergency plans. Curuçá city, located in northeastern Pará state, does not have a map of semi-detailed environmental sensitivity, for that reason, this study aimed to generate a tactical map, scale of 1:100,000, with recognition of coastal environments identified by digital processing of Landsat images and field surveys. The map will help identify the areas more prone to suffer from a possible oil spill. Thus, eight indices were classified as follows: ESI 1B retaining wall, ESI 1C cliffs, ESI 3A sandy beaches and exposed dunes, ESI 7 sandy tidal flat, ESI 9 ebb tide delta, ESI 10A salt marsh, ESI 10B freshwater marsh and ESI 10 mangrove. Finally, the ESI represented in these maps can support the decision making process to prevent and control accidents that may happen during oil production and transportation. Benefits may reflect on lower costs of cleaning and restoration of the impacted areas in case of oil and other potentially harmful load spills.",NA,NA,10.22564/rbgf.v30i4.240,included,NA
"Study Of Productivity And Biomass Above The Ground, Using Vegetation Indices In Plantations Of Tectona Grandis L. (Teak) Located In Guanacaste, Costa Rica","The estimation of wood volume or biomass in forest plantations is one of the key variables for forest management decision making, to improve productivity and profitability of the products and environmental services they offer. Traditional techniques have been based on field inventories, through sampling with plots and human intervention in the acquisition of variables at tree and stand level. Current technology allows estimates to be made using sensors in autonomous vehicles and satellites. In Costa Rica, studies with Landsat and RapidEye satellite images have made it possible to generate updated maps on land cover and land use, including forest types. However, there are few studies on the relationship between volume and biomass values, calculated from data measured in the field and those calculated with remote sensing. This article presents the proposed methodology to estimate the productivity of Tectona grandis L. (Teak) forest plantations using Sentinel-2 satellite images. Taking into account the recommendations of other authors and the experience of the researchers. It is proposed to compare the information generated with Sentinel-2 and that acquired with a UAV with a multispectral camera. It is expected to provide a methodology that uses representative sampling sites, with an adequate sample size, with a control of environmental conditions, considering age, phenological stage and silvicultural treatments.",NA,NA,10.18845/tm.v35i6.6229,included,NA
Use Of Remote Sensing And Gis For Identifying Tanks And Rehabilitation Benefits To The Rural Areas,"Water storage is crucial for water security (WS) in countries with monsoon-driven climates. Tanks significantly contribute to WS by augmenting water supply to agricultural production in parts of south and Southeast Asia. The present paper assesses the potential locations of small tanks for rehabilitation to enhance WS. The Bhadrachalam catchment from the Godavari river basin, India was selected for the study. Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems techniques were used to identify the small tanks and water spread areas for augmenting storage. The cost -benefit analysis was also carried out for the identified tanks with various scenarios, cropping pattern and management options. The returns from desiliting, increase in area under the tank command with paddy and cotton crops are found to be beneficial. It concludes that rehabilitation of small tanks should be considered a priority investment as it will not only enhance WS and financial benefits to local communities, but also augment river flows in the non-monsoon season. © 2019 National Institute of Rural Development.

"Trends And Projections Analysis Of Precipitation And Temperature Data Using Ccsm4 And Gsmap_nrt: Case Study In Sohar, Sultanate Of Oman","Planning for sustainable development requires accurate information on potential future climatic changes. Such climatic information is provided by global climate models (GCMs). One of the key factors determining how biological systems respond to human-caused climate change is variation in temperature and precipitation volume and intensity. The implementation of remote sensing technologies is expanding and increasing in popularity, especially in the context of GCM. However, data are influenced by inaccuracies, even though they are frequently utilized, so correction is necessary. Recent studies show that satellite-based rainfall estimations are inaccurate and have lower values that need to be corrected [1]. In Sohar, Oman, ground station rainfall data were compared with satellite data from several sources, including Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4) and GSMaP_NRT, to assess the correctness of the data. During the evaluation of precipitation, temperatures, and observed and anticipated climatic trends, all sources overestimated the data, particularly rainfall in the summer months. The CCSM4 and GSMaP_NRT data differed from ground station data. Nevertheless, it is possible to improve the data to make sufficiently accurate estimates. When compared to monitoring with a single ground station, using this satellite data will yield significant advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, geographic distribution and coverage, timely issuance, and accuracy with additional or improved inputs. © 2023 by authors, all rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.13189/eer.2023.110411,included,NA
Monitoring And Early Warning Systems - A Design For Human Survival,"Technical means now exist to monitor, predict a danger and issue early warnings when something devastating is estimated to happen in the human environment In order to adapt such means for the benefit of humanity, existing monitoring methods, basic system design principles and natural short and long environmental transformations were investigated. Finally an integrated automatic system for deformation monitoring and surveying of the Chernobyl disaster area, was proposed.

"Advances In Remote Sensing Of Coastal Wetlands: Lidar, Sar, And Object-Oriented Case Studies From North Carolina","Coastal wetlands provide crucial ecosystem services to society including pollution filtration, fish and wildlife nursery and habitat, storm surge mitigation, and sinks for atmospheric carbon. Uncertainty of wetland responses to sea-level rise is a pervasive concern in coastal science and management. Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and multi-sensor and object-oriented image analysis techniques are poised to aid the inventorying, monitoring and management of wetlands to an even greater extent. This chapter reviews developments and coastal wetland applications of these state of the art remote sensing data and techniques and evaluates the utility of these products for management of coastal reserves in case studies. Following concise review of the literature on remote sensing technological and image processing advances, case studies from North Carolina coastal wetlands are presented: (1) multidate SAR and LiDAR imagery for regional salt marsh mapping in Cedar Island National Wildlife Refuge, (2) object-based image analysis (OBIA) for transitional marshes and Phragmites australis inventory in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, and (3) very fine resolution barrier island mapping using multisensor and multidate imagery and OBIA techniques in the Rachel Carson Coastal Reserve. Drawing upon these developments and case studies, insights for practical applications are evaluated to further even wider application to coastal management. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-3-319-06326-3_17,included,NA
The Rocky Road From Research To Operations For Satellite Ocean-Colour Data In Fishery Management,"The aim of the SAFARI project is to accelerate the assimilation of earth-observation data into fisheries research and management by facilitating the application of rapidly evolving satellite technology. This assumes that these data will be available in future. However, for ocean-colour data, that assumption may not hold because of possible gaps in data continuity. Of the many types of satellite data, ocean colour is the most important to fisheries, because it is the only biological measurement. However, current ocean-colour sensors are all operating beyond their planned design life, and there are potential problems with future launches. Although the research community is aware of the value of satellite ocean-colour data, advocacy from the operational community, fishery management in particular, has been lacking. In the United States, the absence of an easily identifiable operational need for ocean-colour data is largely responsible for the likely gap in data continuity. A range of current and potential operational uses of ocean-colour data, some reasons why these data have been underutilized in fishery management, and what can be done to mitigate them are discussed and outlined.",NA,NA,10.1093/icesjms/fsq168,included,NA
Challenges And Opportunities Of Digital Technology In Soil Quality And Land Management Research,"Soil being a unique life elixir determines ecosystem health and success of sustainable practices. However, despite available suite of indicators, sustainable practices are constrained by unreliable yet conflicting information attributed to model abstraction, scale mismatch and non replicability. Besides, stale scientific evidence precludes its relevance to management or policy. It remains a non-trivial task to determine a universal soil quality metric applicable in diverse ecosystems because of the difficulty in modeling soil multifunctionality and complexity across scale and time. The advent of digital technology which incorporate high performance computing systems with cellular communication devices, coupled with agile earth observation systems, creates new prospects for monitoring, demistifying and unravelling the specific drivers of soil quality dynamics. It is increasingly feasible to integrate multiple (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) datasets to inform site specific application of inputs thereby reducing costs, and simultaneously communicating scientific knowledge in real-time to stakeholders. However, fully operationalizing such initiatives remains elusive due to anticipated uncertainity in complex modeling systems. Here, the value addition presented by digital technology in soil and land management research are explicated. The “whole to part” mapping template to guide sustainable land management is revisited, and scientific techniques discussed include multi-criteria analysis intended to: (i) screen-out sensitive variables to any complex-problem, (ii) hierarchically rank significant variables, (iii) investigate the interrelationships of the facets, and (iv) synthesize information at various scales to explore viable solutions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-3-030-71571-7_9,included,NA
Initial Assessment Of Burn Severity Using Transfer Learning Model,"[Objective] Forest fires have broken out frequently in recent years, which severely damages the structure and function of forest ecosystem around the world. Initial assessment of burn severity after forest fires could provide a quantitative basis for rapid implementations of restoration measures in burned areas. In last decades, remote sensing-based models have become an appropriate choice to assess burn severity, which generally requires a certain amount of field survey data. However, this requirement could not be satisfied sufficiently in most cases, since the field survey work would cost a lot of time, labor, and money. Therefore, this would largely limit the efficient application of remote sensing technology to the initial assessment of burn severity. To improve the time-efficiency of traditional remote sensing-based models, a transfer learning algorithm (i.e., SSTCA, semi-supervised Transfer Component Analysis) was employed in this study to build an initial assessment model of burn severity. [Method] At first, the SSTCA algorithm was applied to project a series of new features from original spectral features of remotely sensed data. Based on these projected features, a SVR (Support Vector Regression) model was then trained using historical field survey data of source areas (i.e., Bear fire on June 27, 2002 and Mule fire on July 11, 2002). After that, this combined SSTCA-SVR model was transferred to the initial assessment of burn severity of a target area (i.e., Lushan fire on March 30, 2020). Finally, its performance was quantitatively compared with that of some traditional models (i.e., dNDVI-, dLST-, dNBR-, and SVR-based models). [Results] Results showed that original spectral features of remote sensing images over source and target areas were quite different. After the projection of SSTCA, projected features of source and target samples have similar distribution patterns in the new features-based space. Meanwhile, in the initial assessment of burn severity, dNDVI- and dNBR-based models have overestimated burn severity levels with the lowest accuracy (i.e., overall accuracy was from 20.80% to 24.80% and Kappa value was between 0.01 and 0.06). Compared to these spectral indices-based models, dLST-based model has a better performance with an overall accuracy of 34.80% and a Kappa value of 0.19. Although SVR-based model has shown a promising performance with an overall accuracy of 58.00% and a Kappa value of 0.48, this machine learning model still has overestimated burn severity in some regions of burned areas. Compared to that of mentioned-above models, assessment results of burn severity levels using the SSTCA-SVR model was more accurate with an overall accuracy of 71.20% and a Kappa value of 0.64. [Conclusion] It could be concluded that the application of a transferring learning algorithm would be very helpful for building an assessment model of burn severity with a good transferring ability. In this way, more accurate results could be obtained in the initial assessment of burn severity and the response of post-fire management could thus be speeded up after forest fires. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

Nasa?S Global Precipitation Measurement Mission: Leveraging Stakeholder Engagement \& Applications Activities To Inform Decision-Making,"The application of satellite precipitation estimates from NASA's Global Precipitation Measure-ment (GPM) Mission for decision-making has been a focus for the mission since launch. As a result, GPM data have enabled a range of applications that address societal needs, including water resource management, crop forecasting, ecological monitoring, disaster response, public health, aviation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling, among others. GPM applications activities have continued to focus on user engagement through in person trainings and interviews, work-shops, webinars, and educational outreach activities. The goals of these efforts are to synthesize community data needs in order to effectively support and enable decision-making across agencies, academia and the global community. While these efforts have helped the GPM mission establish a large stakeholder community that encompasses federal and state partners, academic institutions, and private and nonprofit companies, there remains difficulties associated with accessing, pro-cessing, and applying the data to support or enable applications. In this article, we present GPM applications strategies and approaches used to enhance the applications value of GPM data, and most importantly, demonstrate how these efforts have and can inform different decision-making contexts. This work also provides a discussion on key lessons learned from the user community and how this information can be utilized to help better support and shape applications ap-proaches for future NASA Earth Science missions.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100853,included,NA
Contribution Of Remote Sensing For Crop And Water Monitoring,"Agriculture brings with it a number of issues: agricultural production and food security, water and soil resource conservation, limiting the impact of farming on the quality of our environment (water, air, soil). In the context of global changes and the challenges they pose for agriculture sustainability, our ability to characterize how croplands function in terms of water, carbon and particle fluxes is crucial. Developments of agro-ecosystems modeling, including their interactions with the atmosphere and the anthropogenic factors are valuable tools for progress in this direction. Remote sensing, with the high variety of spectral ranges and the fine spatial and temporal resolution currently available, is a tool of great value for various applications in agriculture. The availability of robust inverse methods that allow surface biophysical variables to be assessed, combined with modeling approaches, makes it a high performance tool. The major contributions of remote sensing include:. -its ability to cover large stretches of land and to provide information on the various land uses and practices generated by agriculture. These uses and practices are important to know, both for census purposes (agricultural statistics, agri-environmental monitoring, etc.) and for modeling the behavior of agro-hydrosystems;-providing frequent variables characterizing soil and vegetation properties that allows us to monitor the status of crops, their production potential, their irrigation requirements. This monitoring is a highly strategic issue, both for forecasting purposes, food security and good resource management;-the possibility, from the same information, of assessing the contribution of agricultural lands to net emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs); this assessment is essential for proposing alternative agricultural scenarios for mitigating the contribution of croplands to climate change-thanks to the fine spatial and temporal resolution of information, the possibility of providing a decision support for farming activities according to the intra-field variability (precision farming). This dimension represents an important lever for enabling agricultural systems to achieve better efficiency and economical use of inputs for an agriculture that respects the environment. © ISTE Press Ltd 2016.",NA,NA,10.1016/b978-1-78548-103-1.50004-2,included,NA
Predicting Poverty Index Using Deep Learning On Remote Sensing And Household Data,"The main challenge for approving and implementing policies aiming at sustainable development of country is correct prediction of socioeconomic condition.

Integrating Inland And Coastal Water Quality Data For Actionable Knowledge,"Water quality measures for inland and coastal waters are available as discrete samples from professional and volunteer water quality monitoring programs and higher-frequency, near-continuous data from automated in situ sensors. Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs13152899,included,NA
"Wireless Sensor Networks To Study, Monitor And Manage Cattle In Grazing Systems","Monitoring and management of grazing livestock production systems can be enhanced with remote monitoring technologies collecting information with high temporal and spatial detail. However, the potential benefits of such technologies have yet to be realised and challenges still exist with hardware, and data analysis and interpretation. The objective of this paper was to propose analytical methods and demonstrate the value of remotely collected liveweight (LW) and behaviour of beef cattle grazing tropical pastures. Three remote weighing systems were set up at the water troughs to capture LW of three groups of 20 animals for 341 days. LW data reflected short-term effects following the first rain event (>50 mm) at the end of the dry season, which resulted in LW losses of 22 +/- 8.8 kg of LW at a rate of -1.54 +/- 0.46 kg/day (n = 60). This period was followed by a peak daily LW change (LWC) of +2 kg/day. The remote weighing system also captured longer environmental effects related to seasonal changes in forage quality and quantity with highest LWC during the wet season and weight loss during the dry season. Effects of management on LW and LWC were observed as a result of moving animals to paddocks with more edible forage during the dry season when the negative trend in LWC was reversed after rotating animals. Behavioural monitoring indicated that resting and ruminating took place at camping sites, and foraging resulted in grazing hotspots. Remotely collected LW data captured both short-and long-term temporal changes associated with environmental and management factors, whereas remote monitoring collars captured the spatial distribution of behaviours in the landscape. Wireless sensor networks have the ability to provide data with sufficient detail in real-time making it possible for increased understanding of animal biology and early management interventions that should result in increased production, animal welfare and environmental stewardship.",NA,NA,10.1071/an14368,included,NA
A Daily 25km Short-Latency Rainfall Product For Data-Scarce Regions Based On The Integration Of The Global Precipitation Measurement Mission Rainfall And Multiple-Satellite Soil Moisture Products,"Rain gauges are unevenly spaced around the world with extremely low gauge density over developing countries. For instance, in some regions in Africa the gauge density is often less than one station per 10 000 km(2). The availability of rainfall data provided by gauges is also not always guaranteed in near real time or with a timeliness suited for agricultural and water resource management applications, as gauges are also subject to malfunctions and regulations imposed by national authorities. A potential alternative is satellite-based rainfall estimates, yet comparisons with in situ data suggest they are often not optimal. In this study, we developed a short-latency (i.e. 2-3 d) rainfall product derived from the combination of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) Early Run (IMERG-ER) with multiplesatellite soil-moisture-based rainfall products derived from ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer), SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) L3 (Level 3) satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals. We tested the performance of this product over four regions characterized by high-quality ground-based rainfall datasets (India, the conterminous United States, Australia and Europe) and over data-scarce regions in Africa and South America by using triple-collocation (TC) analysis. We found that the integration of satellite SM observations with in situ rainfall observations is very beneficial with improvements of IMERG-ER up to 20\% and 40\% in terms of correlation and error, respectively, and a generalized enhancement in terms of categorical scores with the integrated product often outperforming reanalysis and ground-based long-latency datasets. We also found a relevant overestimation of the rainfall variability of GPM-based products (up to twice the reference value), which was significantly reduced after the integration with satellite soil-moisture-based rainfall estimates. Given the importance of a reliable and readily available rainfall product for water resource management and agricultural applications over data-scarce regions, the developed product can provide a valuable and unique source of rainfall information for these regions.",NA,NA,10.5194/hess-24-2687-2020,included,NA
Perspectives From Landscape Ecology Can Improve Environmental Impact Assessment,"The outcomes of environmental impact assessment (EIA) influence millions of hectares of land and can be a contentious process. A vital aspect of an EIA process is consideration of the accumulation of impacts from multiple activities and stressors through a cumulative effects assessment (CEA). An opportunity exists to improve the rigor and utility of CEA and EIA by incorporating core scientific principles of landscape ecology into EIA. With examples from a Canadian context, we explore realistic hypothetical situations demonstrating how integration of core scientific principles could impact EIA outcomes. First, we demonstrate how changing the spatial extent of EIA boundaries can misrepresent cumulative impacts via the exclusion or inclusion of surrounding natural resource development projects. Second, we use network analysis to show how even a seemingly small, localized development project can disrupt regional habitat connectivity. Lastly, we explore the benefits of using long-term historical remote sensing products. Because these approaches are straightforward to implement using publicly available data, they provide sensible opportunities to improve EIA and enhance the monitoring of natural resource development activities in Canada and elsewhere.",NA,NA,10.1139/facets-2020-0049,included,NA

Construction Of Super-Resolution Model Of Remote Sensing Image Based On Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"With the continuous improvement of satellite remote sensing technology, using super-resolution image reconstruction technology to reconstruct remote sensing images has important application significance for social development. In the generator model proposed in this paper, the standard convolution layer in the residual network structure is replaced by empty convolution to improve the overall performance of the model while keeping the number of parameters unchanged and the receptive field of convolution at each stage unchanged. By analyzing the advantages of residual network, dense connection network, and cavity convolution in the field of image super resolution, an optimized super-resolution reconstruction model of GAN image with cavity convolution is constructed with dense connection block of cavity residue as a generator component. The cloud computing-based service model is introduced into the image reconstruction system, and the background management module is built through the cloud service system, which is responsible for model training, image transmission, image processing request and database reading. Through experimental analysis, it is proved that the whole automatic data processing from automatic matching data to processing data can be completed, and the performance is better than the traditional service mode, which can produce great economic benefits.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.comcom.2021.06.022,included,NA
Conservation Impacts Of A Near Real-Time Forest Monitoring And Alert System For The Tropics,"Near real-time (NRT) forest monitoring and alert systems based on remotely sensed data are among the most recently developed tools to help manage and protect forest resources. The use of satellite and airborne remote sensing to quickly and accurately detect activities associated with deforestation has great potential for catalyzing local response teams responsible for assessing and interdicting threats to tropical forest ecosystems. To better understand the utility of NRT monitoring technologies in improving environmental protection and management, from 2008 to 2016 Conservation International conducted a series of surveys and interviews with users of these systems in four countries where wildfires threaten tropical forest ecosystems: Madagascar, Indonesia, Bolivia and Peru. Users reported that NRT forest monitoring systems made significant contributions to improving the ability of conservation and forest management organizations to respond to and reduce the impacts of fire, deforestation and other illegal or undesirable forest activity. Understanding the types of applications for which users successfully employed forest monitoring data, the challenges they faced in accessing, analyzing or disseminating these data, and the lessons learned from our attempts to develop and deploy NRT forest monitoring systems is useful to institutions interested in successfully incorporating NRT monitoring into their work.",NA,NA,10.1002/rse2.78,included,NA

Assumption-Versus Data-Based Approaches To Summarizing Species' Ranges,"For conservation decision making, species' geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches. Some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning. We examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses. Extent-of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations. Refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in estimates of species' true areas of distribution. However, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed. Whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing. In contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species' distributional patterns for conservation applications.",NA,NA,10.1111/cobi.12801,included,NA
Remotely Sensed Data For Ecosystem Analyses: Combining Hierarchy Theory And Scene Models,"Remotely sensed data have been used extensively for environmental monitoring and modeling at a number of spatial scales; however, a limited range of satellite imaging systems often. constrained the scales of these analyses. A wider variety of data sets is now available, allowing image data to be selected to match the scale of environmental structure(s) or process(es) being examined. A framework is presented for use by environmental scientists and managers, enabling their spatial data collection needs to be linked to a suitable form of remotely sensed data. A six-step approach is used, combining image spatial analysis and scaling tools, within the context of hierarchy theory. The main steps involved are: (1) identification of information requirements for the monitoring or management problem; (2) development of ideal image dimensions (scene model), (3) exploratory analysis of existing remotely sensed data using scaling techniques, (4) selection and evaluation of suitable remotely sensed data based on the scene model, (5) selection of suitable spatial analytic techniques to meet information requirements, and (6) cost-benefit analysis. Results from a case study show that the framework provided an objective mechanism to identify relevant aspects of the monitoring problem and environmental characteristics for selecting remotely sensed data and analysis techniques.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00267-002-2837-x,included,NA
An Observing System Simulation Experiment Framework For Air Quality Forecasts In Northeast Asia: A Case Study Utilizing Virtual Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer And Surface Monitored Aerosol Data,"Prior knowledge of the effectiveness of new observation instruments or new data streams for air quality can contribute significantly to shaping the policy and budget planning related to those instruments and data. In view of this, one of the main purposes of the development and application of the Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) is to assess the potential impact of new observations on the quality of the current monitoring or forecasting systems, thereby making this framework valuable. This study introduces the overall OSSE framework established to support air quality forecasting and the details of its individual components. Furthermore, it shows case study results from Northeast Asia and the potential benefits of the new observation data scenarios on the PM2.5 forecasting skills, including the PM data from 200 virtual monitoring sites in the Gobi Desert and North Korean non-forest areas (NEWPM) and the aerosol optical depths (AOD) data from South Korea's Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS AOD). Performance statistics suggest that the concurrent assimilation of the NEWPM and the PM data from current monitoring sites in China and South Korea can improve the PM2.5 concentration forecasts in South Korea by 66.4\% on average for October 2017 and 95.1\% on average for February 2018. Assimilating the GEMS AOD improved the performance of the PM2.5 forecasts in South Korea for October 2017 by approximately 68.4\% (\~{}78.9\% for February 2018). This OSSE framework is expected to be continuously implemented to verify its utilization potential for various air quality observation systems and data scenarios. Hopefully, this kind of application result will aid environmental researchers and decision-makers in performing additional in-depth studies for the improvement of PM air quality forecasts.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14020389,included,NA
On Timeliness And Accuracy Of Wildfire Detection By The Goes Wf-Abba Algorithm Over California During The 2006 Fire Season,"The Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF-ABBA) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for geostationary wildfire detection whose results have been increasingly used in a range of environmental applications. At present, the WF-ABBA validation activities and, in general, fire product validation methodologies are at a markedly less advanced stage than the algorithm itself. Particularly, little is known about detection timeliness, despite the value of such information for assessing the potential of geostationary observations to improve tactical decision making of first responders. This paper contributes to reducing this gap in two ways. Firstly, we describe a new methodology that is suitable for evaluating geostationary satellite wildfire detection in terms of incidents with regard to both timeliness and reliability. This methodology utilizes available official multi-agency wildfire reporting information and multitemporal Landsat imagery. Secondly, we apply the proposed validation method to temporally filtered GOES-West WF-ABBA (ver. 6.1) detections for the 2006 fire season over the State of California and present incident-wise and pixel-wise performance information. The results indicate highly reliable pixel-wise performance of WF-ABBA, with about 75\% of fire pixels (or more) corresponding to actual recorded active wildfires. A substantial portion of wildfires were detected during their first hour of activity, and a few incident-even before the initial reports from conventional sources. Although the WF-ABBA performs best at what it was designed for: consistently re-detecting (monitoring) active fires, we believe there is an additional potential for automated detection from current geostationary data to reduce wildfire ignition latencies in the Western U.S. Our results can serve as a guideline for algorithm developers and users of the WF-ABBA fire product.

The Added Value Of A Proposed Satellite Imager For Ground Level Particulate Matter Analyses And Forecasts,"Monitoring aerosols over wide areas is important for the assessment of the population's exposure to health relevant particulate matter (PM). Satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) can contribute to the improvement of highly needed analyzed and forecasted distributions of PM when combined with a model and ground-based observations. In this paper, we evaluate the contribution of column AOD observations from a future imager on a geostationary satellite by performing an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). In the OSSE simulated imager, AOD observations and ground-based PM observations are assimilated in the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to assess the added value of the satellite observations relative to the value of ground-based observations. Results show that in highly polluted situations, the imager AOD observations improve analyzed and forecasted PM2.5 concentrations even in the vicinity of simultaneously incorporated ground-based PM observations. The added value of the proposed imager is small when considering monthly averaged PM distributions. This is attributed to relatively large errors in the imager AODs in case of background aerosol loads coupled to the fact that the imager AODs are column values and an indirect estimate of PM. In the future, model improvements and optimization of the assimilation system should be achieved for better handling of situations with aerosol plumes above the boundary layer and satellite observations containing aerosol profile information. With the suggested improvements, the developed OSSE will form a powerful tool for determining the added value of future missions and defining requirements for planned satellite observations.",NA,NA,10.1109/jstars.2009.2034613,included,NA
Impacts Of Geospatial Information For Decision Making,"Geospatial information contributes to decisions by both societal decision-makers and individuals. Investments in geospatial data have become a part of the political and policy debates that are focused on reducing government spending, as well as increasing societal wellbeing. Although many examples in our everyday life come to mind, good benchmarks of the value of geospatial information are missing. Quantifying this value involves comparisons of the decisions that would have been made with and without the information, and what the consequences of those decisions would have been. The Value of Information (VOI) is linked to the outcome of choice in uncertain situations. Individuals may be willing to pay for improved information depending on how uncertain they are, what is at stake, and the degree to which the benefit exceeds the cost of the information (Macauley 2006). Problems with data access, content interpretation (due to obscure file formats, for example) or use of the data all reduce the information value. Systematic analysis of the benefits of geospatial information in decisions focuses on the quantitative demonstration of why and how scientific data such as earth observations have economic value. Case studies apply the science and technology of geospatial data to inform decisions concerning the costs and benefits of economic and resource development. Two cases studies are provided which show net economic value but different approaches to assessing the VOI. Further steps in refining communication skills, providing a broad acceptance of approaches and a pool of experts to support community needs is envisioned in addressing paths forward. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-3-319-01821-8_10,included,NA
Economic Valuation Of Mangroves In The Niger Delta: An Interdisciplinary Approach,"Today, the concept of an interdisciplinary approach to research has gained tremendous attention, both because it is an antithesis to the conventional divisions of knowledge-based research, and because complex problems in applied research almost always span various disciplines. This study explores one interdisciplinary approach to research, which addresses the problem of equitable mangrove valuation for the sustainable management of the resource in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. By integrating results from satellite remote sensing analysis and socioeconomic surveys, the economic value of mangroves in the Niger Delta, discounted over a 30- year period at 20% discount rate, ranges from $640-2,825ha. The variation in economic value is attributed to the variation in the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities that participated in the study. © 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Exploring The Potential Value Of Satellite Remote Sensing To Monitor Chlorophyll-A For Us Lakes And Reservoirs,"Assessment of chlorophyll-a, an algal pigment, typically measured by field and laboratory in situ analyses, is used to estimate algal abundance and trophic status in lakes and reservoirs. In situ-based monitoring programs can be expensive, may not be spatially, and temporally comprehensive and results may not be available in the timeframe needed to make some management decisions, but can be more accurate, precise, and specific than remotely sensed measures. Satellite remotely sensed chlorophyll-a offers the potential for more geographically and temporally dense data collection to support estimates when used to augment or substitute for in situ measures. In this study, we compare available chlorophyll-a data from in situ and satellite imagery measures at the national scale and perform a cost analysis of these different monitoring approaches. The annual potential avoided costs associated with increasing the availability of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a values were estimated to range between \$5.7 and \$316 million depending upon the satellite program used and the timeframe considered. We also compared sociodemographic characteristics of the regions (both public and private lands) covered by both remote sensing and in situ data to check for any systematic differences across areas that have monitoring data. This analysis underscores the importance of continued support for both field-based in situ monitoring and satellite sensor programs that provide complementary information to water quality managers, given increased challenges associated with eutrophication, nuisance, and harmful algal bloom events.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-020-08631-5,included,NA
Role Of Satellite Remote Sensing In The Geographic Information Economics In France,"In national and international economics, geographic information plays a role which is generally acknowledged to be important but which is however, difficult to assess quantitatively, its applications being rather miscellaneous and indirect. Computer graphics and telecommunications increae that importance still more and justify many investments and research into new cartographic forms. As part of its responsibility for participating in the promotion of those developments, by taking into account needs expressed by public or private users, the National Council for Geographic Information (C.N.I.G.) has undertaken a general evaluation of the economic and social utility of geographic information in France. The study involves an estimation of the cost of production and research activities, which are probably about 0.1% of the Cross National Product-similar to many other countries. It also devised a method of estimating ""cost/advantage"" ratios applicable to these ""intangible"" benefits. Within that framework, remote sensing emphasizes particular aspects related both to the increase of economic performances in cartographic production and to the advent of new products and new ways of utilization. A review of some significant sectors shows effective earnings of about 10-20%, or even 50% or 100% of the costs, and these are doubtless much greater for the efficacy in the exploitation of products. Finally, many applications, entirely new result from extensions in various fields which would have been impossible without remote sensing: here the ""cost advantage"" ratio cannot even be compared with previous processes. Studies were undertaken in parallel for defining different types of products derived from satellite imagery, as well as those domains where development effort is required in order to make new advances. © 1991.",NA,NA,10.1016/0924-2716(91)90065-4,included,NA
Securing Sustainability In Indian Agriculture Through Civilian Uav: A Responsible Innovation Perspective,"Emerging technology like civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has the potential to exert an impact on agriculture production and crop damages assessment. Securing sustainability in agriculture requires accountability and responsibility of the actors engaged in the deployment of the civilian UAV due to associated deployment risks and unintended consequences. UAV technology has the potential to replace remote sensing technologies like satellite imageries and piloted aircraft used in the crop insurance business. The governance of deployment of UAV technology in India is a complex challenge when a well-developed regulatory system is not in place and diverse actors involved in the deployment and operation of civilian UAV for agricultural applications. Therefore, two main questions, how UAV innovations can lead to sustainability in Indian agriculture and how are the issues of governance of civil UAV innovations in crop insurance applications addressed, are dealt with. The responsible innovation approach is adopted as a theoretical framework. The exploratory and qualitative study used in-depth interviews, and the interviewees were selected through snowball sampling technique. The results suggest that in the governance of emerging technologies like UAV certain values such as trust, transparency, safety, autonomy, and environmental friendliness assumed high significance. Findings also suggest that UAV has the risk-taking ability in adverse weather condition. The UAV technology also creates values (social, economic and environmental) for deployment in the crop insurance business in India.",NA,NA,10.1007/s42452-019-1901-6,included,NA
Multilayer Data And Artificial Intelligence For The Delineation Of Homogeneous Management Zones In Maize Cultivation,"Variable rate application (VRA) is a crucial tool in precision agriculture, utilizing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) to access vast satellite image datasets and employ machine learning (ML) techniques for data processing. This research investigates the feasibility of implementing supervised ML models (random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting trees (GBT), classification and regression trees (CART)) and unsupervised k-means clustering in GEE to generate accurate management zones (MZs). By leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and yielding monitor data, these models calculate vegetation indices to monitor crop health and reveal hidden patterns. The achieved classification accuracy values (0.67 to 0.99) highlight the potential of GEE and ML models for creating precise MZs, enabling subsequent VRA implementation.

"Integrative Geospatial Approaches For The Comprehensive Monitoring And Assessment Of Land Management Sustainability: Rationale, Potentials, And Characteristics","Sustainable dryland management seeks to improve the conditions of people and ecosystems affected by degradation, but it is often unclear which land management strategies work, which ones do not and why. Monitoring and assessment (M\&A) can support decision-making by providing this information. As implied by the 10-year Strategy of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), however, M\&A efforts have thus far been insufficient or inadequate. We argue that integrative geospatial approaches should be implemented to enhance dryland management decision-making. By assimilating and linking human and environmental data, qualitative and quantitative data, as well as field and remotely sensed data in a spatially explicit framework, such approaches facilitate assessments of both the complexities and place-specificities inherent to sustainability. In addition, they help represent different stakeholder perspectives, promote communication among scientists from diverse backgrounds as well as between scientific and local experts, facilitate inter-institutional knowledge sharing, and create synergy between the UNCCD and other Conventions. Due to these benefits as well as the rapid evolution and increasing availability and affordability of geospatial data and technologies in all countries, it is appropriate to begin capitalizing more fully on them now for the M\&A of land management sustainability. In order for integrative geospatial approaches to become more central to M\&A efforts, however, capacities and infrastructure must be improved and standards and protocols developed for the collection, analysis, and modeling of data, for the evaluation of outputs, and for the reporting of results.

Sebu: A Novel Fully Automated Google Earth Engine Surface Energy Balance Model For Urban Areas,"Understanding the diverse energy exchange within the city's boundaries would enable better design of future urban planning and environmental policies and update current ones. More importantly, it would facilitate the establishment of smart cities, where human health and wellbeing is a top priority. In this regard, several energy balance models have been proposed for urban areas. Only recently, remote sensing images have been extensively used in these areas, but are still difficult to implement due to the large inputs' sources and types required as well as their complexity. Their accuracy can also be improved. Thus, in this paper, the Surface Energy Balance Model for Urban areas (SEBU) is proposed based on the 100-m Landsat images. It uses other sources as well such as Sentinel-1, MODIS and ERA5. SEBU is based on the innovative hot/cold pixels approach widely known in the agricultural-based models, but also includes several dynamic internal calibrations. It generates monthly turbulent sensible (Qh) and latent (Qe) heat values over a 100-m spatial resolution. When applied over seven different regions (i.e., Denver, New Hampshire, Basel, Heraklion, Singapore, Phoenix and Vancouver) in four contrasting climates (i.e., cold, arid, warm and equatorial) and when compared to local flux tower measurements, absolute mean error varied between 6.13 W m(-2) month-1 for Qe and 14.46 W m(-2) month(-1) for Qh. More importantly, the novelty of SEBU does not lie only in providing reliable accuracy and full reliance on the remote sensing database, but also on its open-source nature and easy-accessibility over the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Thus, SEBU has the potential to be scalable using the massive power and huge database found in GEE, where users need to specify the required date only. This would certainly assist researchers to access urban cilmate information in a timely manner. Policy makers and even local dwellers would then benefit from their findings. Furthermore, SEBU can be improved to accommodate current and future needs of its users, while ultimately, enhancing the urban surface energy models and related science.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101187,included,NA
Possibilities Of The Practical Application Of Remote Sensing Data In Real Property Appraisal,"In the process of real estate evaluation, there are many important elements that should be taken into consideration: for example the type of property which is under evaluation, real estate market analysis, and the selection of appropriate evaluation approaches, methods and techniques. In each of the approaches, different parameters are important. Most importantly, however, is the appropriate selection and identification of real estate characteristics, both physical and economic, as well as the determination of the importance of these qualities so that, when necessary, it will be possible to make the appraisal and select those characteristics which have the greatest impact on value of property. To acquire information about real estate, one can analyze data from multiple sources of information, such as: the land and mortgage register, land and buildings register, local town and country planning, industry data and other. Integrating data from all these sources allows comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge on the assessed property to be developed. One of best sources of data describing the characteristics of real estate is remote sensing. This method offers a high spectrum of information and, therefore, allows a wide range of analyses. As a result, one can obtain highly accurate facts about the property. Remote sensing data, however, are not a panacea for all problems and have some limitations that determine their applicability. This paper describes the possibilities of specifying some characteristics of the property under appraisal based on remote sensing data. For this purpose, the qualitative - quantitative analysis of the four most ""common"" types of remote sensing data were made, along with determining selected characteristics of 30 properties located in the Warsaw - Bemowo suburb area. The results of this research made it possible to answer the question of whether it is practicable and, if so, to what extent, to use remotely sensed data as the basis for determining the characteristics of a property as well as connecting the types of data to individual properties. The paper focuses on defining the characteristics of two kinds of real estate: land and buildings. © 2015 De Gruyter Open Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.1515/remav-2015-0016,included,NA

Potential Of Npp-Viirs Nighttime Light Imagery For Modeling The Regional Economy Of China,"Historically, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) was the unique satellite sensor used to collect the nighttime light, which is an efficient means to map the global economic activities. Since it was launched in October 2011, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite has become a new satellite used to monitor nighttime light. This study performed the first evaluation on the NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery in modeling economy, analyzing 31 provincial regions and 393 county regions in China. For each region, the total nighttime light (TNL) and gross regional product (GRP) around the year of 2010 were derived, and a linear regression model was applied on the data. Through the regression, the TNL from NPP-VIIRS were found to exhibit R2 values of 0.8699 and 0.8544 with the provincial GRP and county GRP, respectively, which are significantly stronger than the relationship between the TNL from DMSP-OLS (F16 and F18 satellites) and GRP. Using the regression models, the GRP was predicted from the TNL for each region, and we found that the NPP-VIIRS data is more predictable for the GRP than those of the DMSP-OLS data. This study demonstrates that the recently released NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery has a stronger capacity in modeling regional economy than those of the DMSP-OLS data. These findings provide a foundation to model the global and regional economy with the recently availability of the NPP-VIIRS data, especially in the regions where economic census data is difficult to access. © 2013 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs5063057,included,NA
The Value Of Rapid Damage Assessment For Efficient Earthquake Response,"Every year earthquakes cause substantial economic losses and loss of life in many parts of the world. Earth observations may provide valuable information on spatial damage distribution and through that increase the efficiency of rapid response actions, finally resulting in reduction of earthquake induced losses. However, a methodology for quantitative assessment of the potential value of information in such a context has not yet been developed. That knowledge would be of high importance for planning and development of Earth observation systems on both regional and international levels when aiming at sustainable development goals. In this paper we suggest a stochastic modeling approach to assess the value of information for earthquake rapid response. Our analysis is focused on a rather short time interval after an earthquake occurrence (order of several hours) when there is a maximum need for urgent help to the earthquake victims. We use rescue efficiency as a performance measure of earthquake response actions; this efficiency is described in terms of timely arrival of rescue teams at places, where their help is mostly needed. We quantify the benefit of using spatial damage distribution information in terms of cost reduction/rescue efficiency gains. We intentionally conduct our analysis at a methodological level and do not go deeper into case studies to keep general conclusions traceable. The modeling exercise we present in the paper is a first step towards a more detailed and integrated approach that could contribute to better systematic understanding of earthquake response actions and ultimately improve their efficiency.

Comprehensive Analysis For Long-Term Hydrological Simulation By Deep Learning Techniques And Remote Sensing,"Hydrological simulation plays a very important role in understanding the hydrological processes and is of great significance to flood forecasting and optimal allocation of water resources in the watershed. The development of deep learning techniques has brought new opportunities and methods for long-term hydrological simulation research at the watershed scale. Different from traditional hydrological models, the application of deep learning techniques in the hydrological field has greatly promoted the development trend of runoff prediction and provides a new paradigm for hydrological simulation. In this study, a CNN-LSTM model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a CNN-GRU model based on CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRN) are constructed to study the watershed hydrological processes. To compare the performance of deep learning techniques and the hydrological model, we also constructed the distributed hydrological model: Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model based on remote sensing data. These models were applied to the Xixian Basin, and the promising results had been achieved, which verified the rationality of the method, with the majority of percent bias error (PBE) values ranging between 3.17 and 13.48, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.63 and 0.91, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.70 and 0.90 on a monthly scale. The results demonstrated their strong ability to learn complex hydrological processes. The results also indicated that the proposed deep learning models could provide the certain decision support for the water environment management at the watershed scale, which was of great significance to improve the hydrological disaster prediction ability and was conducive to the sustainable development of water resources.",NA,NA,10.3389/feart.2022.875145,included,NA
Comparison Of Multi-Source Satellite Data For Quantifying Water Quality Parameters In A Mining Environment,"Population growth and associated anthropogenic activities such as mining are posing a major threat to water resources. Remote sensing provides valuable information for assessing and monitoring water quality and quantity, and thus supports sustainable water management. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of various remote sensing techniques for quantifying water quality parameters, however, more needs to be done to exploit the growing number of satellite sensors available to the public. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of individual and combined bands of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, ASTER and SPOT 6 data as predictors of water quality parameters of open water bodies in a mining area. We applied the all-subsets regression approach to explore all possible candidate models from which selection was made based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), coefficient of determination (adjR2) and Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE). Two secondary objectives that make use of the products of the all-subsets regression approach were added in the study. This included comparison of a parsimonious model containing few predictors with the model that was ranked the best but containing more predictors; and comparison of models consisting of similar bands across sensors per water quality parameter. In general, all sensors yielded promising estimation accuracies, particularly for SAR, permanent hardness and cations (RMSE < 50\% of observed means). Sentinel-2 bands produced the best estimations followed by Landsat 8 bands for most water quality parameters, chiefly due to the greater number of bands these sensors possess compared to ASTER and SPOT 6 sensors. All sensors provided alternative models that used fewer predicting bands than the best-ranked models (lowest AIC) and still showed comparable accuracies with the lowest AIC models for most variables (Pearson's correlation, r up to 0.9). Sentinel-2, in particular, had the most accurate, parsimonious models compared to the other sensors. Pairwise cross-sensor comparison of estimation models using similar bands revealed the best matches when a model consisted of blue band only (r > 0.95) for most parameters while the similarity decreased as the number of predicting bands increased. Furthermore, the best similarities were obtained between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors compared to the other pairs, indicating the potential of replacing one in the absence of the other. The findings of this study showed the advantage of commonly used remotely-sensed data for estimating, and by extension monitoring, water quality parameters in open water bodies. In addition, the results revealed that few, specific bands carry information relevant to characterise most of the water quality parameters considered in the study. We recommend similar studies for different seasons, considering the need to monitor water quality throughout the year.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125322,included,NA
Justification For Site-Specific Weed Management Based On Ecology And Economics,"One of the primary benefits of site-specific agricultural technologies is the potential to reduce the use of polluting inputs, thereby minimizing ecological damage. Weeds are often found in patches, so site-specific (field scale) management offers a straightforward opportunity to minimize ecological effects related to wasteful broadcast use of herbicides. Beyond possible efficiencies related to accurate targeting, site-specific technologies, through a process of parameterizing management decision models for each field, may improve ecological understanding of weed populations and thus encourage ecologically based management. This hypothesis was assessed with a simple model that combined economic injury level prediction with a single parameter (growing season precipitation) to represent environmental variability. Model simulations of crop yield in response to weed density at a virtual farm and six surrounding regional experiment stations suggested that localized (on-farm field) parameter estimation may help to circumvent the variability associated with damage function extrapolation from small-plot experiments at experiment stations and thereby improve predictive accuracy for site-specific weed management (SSWM) strategies. Thus, remote sensing and SSWM technologies may allow producers to reduce the risk associated with the reduced use of purchased inputs and greater reliance on natural weed population-regulating mechanisms. Effective ecologically based weed management may be dependent on local parameterization of models.",NA,NA,10.1614/ws-04-071r2,included,NA
Assessing Impacts Of Mining: Recent Contributions From Gis And Remote Sensing,"Mining produces several environmental, social, and economic impacts which can be analysed spatially using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS). This paper provides an overview of recent studies using these techniques to assess mining impacts on water, land, and society. It also highlights the geographic complexities of these impacts via mining case studies, and discusses spatial research methods, data sources, and limitations. Despite noted simplifications, risks, and uncertainties of mapping the impacts of mining, the cases included in our overview illustrate that there are clearly beneficial applications. At a local level, these include environmental and socioeconomic risk assessments, disaster mitigation, and adjudication on mine-related conflicts. At a regional level, spatial analyses can support cumulative and strategic impact assessments. At a global level, spatial analyses can reveal industry-wide land use trends, and provide key land use data for comparative analyses of mining impacts between commodities, locations, and mine configurations. The degree to which such benefits are realised will likely depend on the resources afforded to what is a growing field of study.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.exis.2019.06.011,included,NA
On The Contribution Of Satellite Altimetry-Derived Water Surface Elevation To Hydrodynamic Model Calibration In The Han River,"Satellite altimetry can fill the spatial gaps of in-situ gauging networks especially in poorly gauged regions. Although at a generally low temporal resolution, satellite altimetry has been successfully used for water surface elevation (WSE) estimation and hydrodynamic modeling. This study aims to investigate the contribution of WSE from both short-repeat and geodetic altimetry to hydrodynamic model calibration, and also explore the contribution of the new Sentinel-3 mission. Two types of data sources (i.e., in-situ and satellite altimetry) are investigated together with two roughness cases (i.e., spatially variable and uniform roughness) for calibration of a hydrodynamic model (DHI MIKE 11) with available bathymetry. A 150 km long reach of Han River in China with rich altimetry and in-situ gauging data is selected as a case study. Results show that the performances of the model calibrated by satellite altimetry-derived datasets are acceptable in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of simulated WSE. Sentinel-3A can support hydrodynamic model calibration even though it has a relatively low temporal resolution (27-day repeat cycle). The CryoSat-2 data with a higher spatial resolution (7.5 km at the Equator) are proved to be more valuable than the Sentinel-3A altimetry data with a low spatial resolution (104 km at the Equator) for hydrodynamic model calibration in terms of RMSE values of 0.16 and 0.18 m, respectively. Moreover, the spatially variable roughness can also improve the model performance compared to the uniform roughness case, with decreasing RMSE values by 2-14\%.

To ensure that participants can enjoy an event safely and carefree, it must be comprehensively prepared and attentively monitored. Remote sensing can provide valuable information to identify potential risks and take appropriate measures in order to prevent a disaster, or initiate emergency aid measures as quickly as possible in the event of an emergency. Especially, three-dimensional (3D) information that is derived using photogrammetry can be used to analyze the terrain and map existing structures that are set up at short notice. Using aerial imagery acquired during a German music festival in 2016 and the celebration of the German Protestant Church Assembly of 2017, the authors compare two-dimensional (2D) and novel fusion-based 3D change detection methods, and discuss their suitability for supporting large-scale events during the relevant phases of crisis management. This study serves to find out what added value the use of 3D change information can provide for on-site crisis management. Based on the results, an operational, fully automatic processor for crisis management operations and corresponding products for end users can be developed.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs10122054,included,NA
"Evaluation Financiere De L‘integration De Technologies Satellitaires, Pour Le Suivi Du Couvert Nival, Au Sein D‘une Entreprise Hydroelectrique (Le Cas De L‘utilisation Du Satellite Radarsat I Dans Le Bassin De La Riviere La Grande (Quebec))","The emergence, on the markets, of new technologies evokes, for the potential users, a lot of questions concerning the implementation and operation costs associated with these technologies. Nevertheless, for a lot of users, costs should be considered with the benefits these technologies are able to generate. The benefit-cost analysis is a useful tool for a financial evaluation of the transferability of the technology. This method has been selected to evaluate the eventual implementation of remote sensing technologies for snow cover measurements in the La Grande river basin (Quebec, Canada). Indeed, a better assessment of the snow water equivalent leads to a better forecasting of the water inputs due to the snowmelt. Thus, the improvement of the snow cover monitoring has direct impact on hydroelectric reservoir management. The benefit-cost analysis was used to compare three acquisition modes of the satellite Radarsat 1 (ScanSAR, Wide and Standard). The costs considered for this project are: R D costs and operations costs (the purchase of images and costs of gound truth measurements). We evaluated the raw benefits on the basis of reducing the standard deviation of predicted inflows. The results shows that the ScanSAR mode is the primary remote sensing tool for the monitoring ofthe snow cover, on an operational basis. With this acquisition mode, the benefit-cost ratios range between 2.3:1 and 3.9:1, using a conservative 4% reduction of the standard deviation. Even if the reduction is only 3%, ScanSAR remains profitable. Due to the large number of images needed to cover all the territory, the Standard and Wide modes are penalized by the purchase and the processing costs of the data and with delays associated to the processing. Nevertheless, with these two modes, it could be possible to work with a partial coverage of the watershed, 75% being covered in 4 days in Wide mode. The estimated B/C ratios (1.5:1 et 2:1) confirm the advantages of this alternative, particularly if any technical problems (geometric correction and radiometric precision) are encountered with ScanSAR products. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",NA,NA,10.1080/014311699212335,included,NA
Comparative Analysis Of Machine Learning Algorithms In Automatic Identification And Extraction Of Water Boundaries,"Monitoring open water bodies accurately is important for assessing the role of ecosystem services in the context of human survival and climate change. There are many methods available for water body extraction based on remote sensing images, such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified NDWI (MNDWI), and machine learning algorithms. Based on Landsat-8 remote sensing images, this study focuses on the effects of six machine learning algorithms and three threshold methods used to extract water bodies, evaluates the transfer performance of models applied to remote sensing images in different periods, and compares the differences among these models. The results are as follows. (1) Various algorithms require different numbers of samples to reach their optimal consequence. The logistic regression algorithm requires a minimum of 110 samples. As the number of samples increases, the order of the optimal model is support vector machine, neural network, random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost. (2) The accuracy evaluation performance of each machine learning on the test set cannot represent the local area performance. (3) When these models are directly applied to remote sensing images in different periods, the AUC indicators of each machine learning algorithm for three regions all show a significant decline, with a decrease range of 0.33–66.52%, and the differences among the different algorithm performances in the three areas are obvious. Generally, the decision tree algorithm has good transfer performance among the machine learning algorithms with area under curve (AUC) indexes of 0.790, 0.518, and 0.697 in the three areas, respectively, and the average value is 0.668. The Otsu threshold algorithm is the optimal among threshold methods, with AUC indexes of 0.970, 0.617, and 0.908 in the three regions respectively and an average AUC of 0.832. © 2021 by the authors.

Geo-Cropsim: A Geo-Spatial Crop Simulation Modeling Framework For Regional Scale Crop Yield And Water Use Assessment,"Remote sensing derived datasets (e.g. Leaf Area Index (LAI)) are increasingly being used in process based cropping system models to improve the prediction skill of the simulations when implementing operationally at regional scale. However, challenges such as inadequate quality of the available remote sensing data products and high reliance of models on climate variables and their uncertainties still exist. To address these challenges, we developed Geo-CropSim, a spatial modeling framework to use high quality remote sensing products in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model to regulate simulated processes and improve predictions of crop yield and evapotranspiration. Geo-CropSim comprises three main features 1) pixel level model initialization using crop emergence dates; 2) ability of the EPIC model to read in the PROSAIL (i.e. combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model) inversion-based crop type LAI; and 3) a stress adjustment function to regulate simulated stress using LAI anomalies. To understand its performance, we implemented it over the State of Nebraska to estimate corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [Merr.]) yields and evapotranspiration (ET) for 2012 (drought year) and 2015 (normal year) at 500-m resolution. Results showed that emergence dates and seasonal LAI captured spatial and temporal differences in crop progression (e.g. delayed planting in 2015) and growth (e.g. declined LAI in 2012) driven by regional differences in crop management and weather conditions very well. These differences were reflected in Geo-CropSim yield estimates, and showed improved spatial and temporal details compared over those from EPIC simulations obtained without using remote sensing derived emergence and LAI. Results revealed that Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Geo-CropSim yield estimates, computed based on USDA-NASS reported yields, were 18.85% and 1.22 Mg ha−1 for corn, and 17.90% and 0.46 Mg ha−1 for soybeans, respectively, which are substantially lower than those of original EPIC estimates (MAPE = 33.74% and RMSE = 2.18 Mg ha−1 for corn; and MAPE = 40.71% and RMSE = 0.98 Mg ha−1 for soybeans). Further, Geo-CropSim was able to capture ET and transpiration dynamics reasonably well (e.g. 10–12 % lower values for soybeans compared to corn values), and showed good agreement with flux measurements (i.e. R2 values of 0.63 and 0.72, RMSE values of 29.88 and 33.41 mm, and MAPE values of 5.0% and 6.8% for corn and soybean, respectively). Overall, this study demonstrated that Geo-CropSim has considerable potential to serve as a reliable operational tool to assess crop yields and water use under various cropping systems and to help in regional yield monitoring and water resource management. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Redefining Climate Regions In The United States Of America Using Satellite Remote Sensing And Machine Learning For Public Health Applications,"Existing climate classification has not been designed for an efficient handling of public health scenarios. This work aims to design an objective spatial climate regionalization method for assessing health risks in response to extreme weather. Specific climate regions for the conterminous United States of America (USA) were defined using satellite remote sensing (RS) data and compared with the conventional Köppen-Geiger (KG) divisions. Using the nationwide database of hospitalisations among the elderly (≥65 year olds), we examined the utility of a RS-based climate regionalization to assess public health risk due to extreme weather, by comparing the rate of hospitalisations in response to thermal extremes across climatic regions. Satellite image composites from 2002-2012 were aggregated, masked and compiled into a multi-dimensional dataset. The conterminous USA was classified into 8 distinct regions using a stepwise regionalization approach to limit noise and collinearity (LKN), which exhibited a high degree of consistency with the KG regions and a well-defined regional delineation by annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation values. The most populous was a temperate wet region (10.9 million), while the highest rate of hospitalisations due to exposure to heat and cold (9.6 and 17.7 cases per 100,000 persons at risk, respectively) was observed in the relatively warm and humid south-eastern region. RS-based regionalization demonstrates strong potential for assessing the adverse effects of severe weather on human health and for decision support. Its utility in forecasting and mitigating these effects has to be further explored. © 2014, Page Press Publications. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.4081/gh.2014.294,included,NA
A Sensor Web And Web Service-Based Approach For Active Hydrological Disaster Monitoring,"Rapid advancements in Earth-observing sensor systems have led to the generation of large amounts of remote sensing data that can be used for the dynamic monitoring and analysis of hydrological disasters. The management and analysis of these data could take advantage of distributed information infrastructure technologies such as Web service and Sensor Web technologies, which have shown great potential in facilitating the use of observed big data in an interoperable, flexible and on-demand way. However, it remains a challenge to achieve timely response to hydrological disaster events and to automate the geoprocessing of hydrological disaster observations. This article proposes a Sensor Web and Web service-based approach to support active hydrological disaster monitoring. This approach integrates an event-driven mechanism, Web services, and a Sensor Web and coordinates them using workflow technologies to facilitate the Web-based sharing and processing of hydrological hazard information. The design and implementation of hydrological Web services for conducting various hydrological analysis tasks on the Web using dynamically updating sensor observation data are presented. An application example is provided to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over the traditional approach. The results confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach in cases of hydrological disaster.",NA,NA,10.3390/ijgi5100171,included,NA
Open-Source Satellite Data And Gis For Land Resource Mapping,"The capabilities of satellite data and geographic information system (GIS) to assess and monitor land resources are escalating with the technical advancements. However, the costs of these data and the GIS softwares are barrier to their use by broader community, particularly in developing countries. To maximize the scientific and societal benefits of the spatial data, open data and softwares are being promoted. Several satellite data from different sources with a wide array of spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions are now being made available free to all categories of users. To analyze the satellite data of widely differing characteristics and other spatial and nonspatial data from different sources, rapid advancements have been observed in free/open-source software (FOSS) development in the field of GIS.

Aggregating High-Priority Landscape Areas To The Parcel Level: An Easement Implementation Tool,"Landscape characteristics and parcel ownership information are often collected on different spatial scales leading to difficulties in implementing land use plans at the parcel level. This study provides a method for aggregating highly resolute landscape planning information to the parcel level. Our parcel prioritization model directly incorporates a Land Trust's conservation goals in the form of a compromise programming model. We then demonstrate the use of our approach for implementation decisions, including parcel selection under a budget constraint and the estimation of a total conservation budget necessary to meet specific conservation goals. We found that these cost constraints significantly alter the composition of the 'best' parcels for conservation and can also provide guidance for implementation. The model's results were integral to a local Land Trust's ability to further define and achieve their goals. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.01.007,included,NA

Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles In Bushfire Management: Challenges And Opportunities,"The intensity and frequency of bushfires have increased significantly, destroying property and living species in recent years. Presently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology advancements are becoming increasingly popular in bushfire management systems because of their fundamental characteristics, such as manoeuvrability, autonomy, ease of deployment, and low cost. UAVs with remote-sensing capabilities are used with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep-learning algorithms to detect fire regions, make predictions, make decisions, and optimize fire-monitoring tasks. Moreover, UAVs equipped with various advanced sensors, including LIDAR, visual, infrared (IR), and monocular cameras, have been used to monitor bushfires due to their potential to provide new approaches and research opportunities. This review focuses on the use of UAVs in bushfire management for fire detection, fire prediction, autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and search and rescue to improve the accuracy of fire prediction and minimize their impacts on people and nature. The objective of this paper is to provide valuable information on various UAV-based bushfire management systems and machine-learning approaches to predict and effectively respond to bushfires in inaccessible areas using intelligent autonomous UAVs. This paper aims to assemble information about the use of UAVs in bushfire management and to examine the benefits and limitations of existing techniques of UAVs related to bushfire handling. However, we conclude that, despite the potential benefits of UAVs for bushfire management, there are shortcomings in accuracy, and solutions need to be optimized for effective bushfire management.",NA,NA,10.3390/drones7010047,included,NA
Evaluating The Potential Of Freely Available Multispectral Remotely Sensed Imagery In Mapping American Bramble (Rubus Cuneifolius),"Globally, alien invasive plant species are considered a serious threat to native flora and fauna. In the eastern parts South Africa, the American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) has been identified as one of the major threats to social and ecological systems. Optimal management and mitigation of American bramble spread requires reliable and cost effective approaches to determine invaded spatial extents. In this study, we test the value of the recently launched, freely available Sentinel-2 (S2), as opposed to conventional Landsat 8 imagery in mapping the American bramble. Using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm, we seek to identify the optimal season for mapping the American bramble as well as the most influential bands in the classification process. Results show that Sentinel-2 out-performed Landsat 8 in all seasons, with summer providing the highest classification accuracy (77\% accuracy). The study also shows that strategically placed Sentinel-2 bands of Near Infrared, Red edge and Short Wave Infrared significantly contribute to an increase in overall bramble mapping accuracy. This study demonstrates the value of freely available multispectral imagery in mapping American bramble at large spatial extents, hence valuable for cost-effective operational use.",NA,NA,10.1080/03736245.2018.1461683,included,NA
Resilience Aspects In The Sensor Web Infrastructure For Natural Disaster Monitoring And Risk Assessment Based On Earth Observation Data,"This paper focuses on enabling resilience of the Sensor Web system for disaster monitoring and risk assessment that is based on the use of Earth Observation (EO) data. Resilience is the ability of the system to maintain trustworthy service delivery in spite of changes. Resilience of the EO infrastructure becomes an extremely important issue, especially in the disaster management domain. We propose to enable resilience through: 1) the use of grid resources and services to meet high performance computing requirements; and 2) assessment of resource reputation to select reliable resources. Grid services enable redundancy through integration of heterogeneous resources administrated by geographically distributed organizations. The same services could be provided by different organizations within the infrastructure, and could be of different levels of quality. Therefore, we propose to incorporate a utility-based reputation model to assess reliability of the resources. The proposed approach is implemented within the Namibia Sensor Web Pilot Project that was created as a testbed for evaluating and prototyping key technologies for rapid acquisition and distribution of data products for decision support systems to monitor floods.",NA,NA,10.1109/jstars.2014.2313573,included,NA
Maximizing Societal Benefit Across Multiple Hyperspectral Earth Observation Missions: A User Needs Approach,"Imaging spectroscopy is a powerful tool used to support diverse Earth science and applications objectives, ranging from understanding and mitigating widespread impacts of climate change to management of water at farm-scale. Community studies, such as those deployed by NASA's Surface Biology and Geology and ESA's Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment, have offered new and tangible insights into user needs that are then incorporated into overall mission planning and design. These technologies and tools will be key to develop and consolidate downstream services for users and resource management, given the current pressures on the environment posed by climate change and population growth. This process has highlighted the degree to which planned mission capabilities are responsive to community needs. In this study, we analyze user requirements belonging to the Italian Copernicus User Forum and to the user pool of NASA's Surface Biology and Geology community for the synergic use of hyperspectral imaging technology, providing a reference for the development of earth observation services and the consolidation of existing ones. In addition, potential cross-mission coordination is analyzed to highlight key benefits-(a) addressing shared community needs around products requiring more frequent temporal revisit and (b) shared resources and community expertise around algorithm development. This paper discusses the critical role of early engagement with users to establish a community of practice ready to work with high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy data sets. The main outcome is a guide for the synergetic use of hyperspectral mission and data together with the identification of the main gaps between user needs and satellite capabilities influencing the development of key national and trans-national downstream services. In this research we have analyzed needs of users to understand how to develop and improve earth observation downstream services. Hyperspectral imaging provides information across the electromagnetic spectrum in more detail than multispectral imaging, allowing more specific analysis and accurate identification of materials and substances. The users in this study belong to the Italian Copernicus User Forum and to the NASA Surface Biology and Geology community which provided requirements respectively for ESA's Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment and NASA's Surface Biology and Geology. This work identifies common users and examines the advantages of potential synergy between these hyperspectral satellites for responding to their needs. This analysis shows that the synergy would bring significant advantages in terms of improved revisit time and represents an opportunity to address shared community needs around product and algorithm development. Current users' needs for hyperspectral earth observation data suggest future investment in improving spatial and temporal resolutionCoordination between missions can fill this gap especially improving temporal revisitShared community and resources can facilitate the improvement of products from these missions and their use across different sectors",NA,NA,10.1029/2023jg007569,included,NA
To Pay Or Not To Pay? Monitoring Performance And Enforcing Conditionality When Paying For Forest Conservation In Mexico,"Paying landowners to conserve forests is a promising new strategy to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. However to succeed with this approach, programme managers need reliable monitoring data to make informed payment decisions. This includes withholding payment from landowners who do not meet conservation objectives. The monitoring method used for the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund compared aerial photographs and conducted field sampling to identify forest changes. The comparison of aerial photographs showed that 161 hectares of forest were degraded in the central core zone of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico between 2001 and 2003. As a result, payment was withheld from one of 13 landowners. Analysis of high resolution (0.6 m) digital aerial photographs did not detect finer scale changes, despite obtaining an average pixel resolution 1000 times greater than Landsat satellite imagery. This suggests that current payment for ecosystem services programmes are underestimating environmental change and overpaying non-compliant participants. In addition, selecting a decision rule to enforce payment conditionality raised new questions about how much ecosystem degradation should be permitted before withholding payment. Sound decisions about withholding payment cannot be developed until the marginal value of ecosystem services is better understood. Until then, payment thresholds can be based on specific policy objectives.",NA,NA,10.1017/s0376892909990063,included,NA
Formalizing A Two-Step Decision-Making Process In Land Use: Evidence From Controlling Forest Clearcutting Using Spatial Information,"In this paper, we examine a particular case of land use pattern: forest management activities facing an uncertainty related to spatial information signals received. We investigate the combination of two well-known theoretical approaches, the Blackwell theorem and entropy analysis, in providing a decision support framework for decision makers. We examine the uncertainty related to the information signals received within a decision support context and compute the optimal actions. Drawing on satellite imagery as an additional source of information provided by French spatial data infrastructure (SDI), we illustrate our approach through a clear-cutting control case study. The control of clear-cutting is a central issue in forest management. In order to perform an efficient control operation, uncertainty regarding the decisions to be taken needs to be minimized. Reducing uncertainty in a decision-making context related to forest management provides greater opportunities for improving productivity and for saving time and money. The results show that the information structure through the SDI signals has the most significant information power. Moreover, a maximum of two information structures can be compared when applying the Blackwell theorem. However, while using the entropy approach, a comparison of several information structures can be performed.",NA,NA,10.3390/land12010015,included,NA
Supporting Management Of Refugee Streams By Earth Observation And Geoinformation,"The sharp increase in refugee numbers arriving in the European Union has recently caused major and manifold challenges for the member states and their administrative services. Location based situation reports and maps may support the refugee management from local to European level. The first support is mapping of the geographical distribution of migrating people which needs more or less real time data. The actual data sources are location related observations along the routes of refugees, actual satellite observations and data mining results. These tools and data are used to monitor spatial distributions as well as extrapolate the arrival of refugees for the subsequent weeks. The second support is the short-term update of the location of initial registration facilities and first reception facilities, their capacities, and their occupancy. The third support level is the systematic inquiry for unoccupied housing facilities and for empty places within build-up areas. For this purpose Geo-coded datasets of house numbers have to be cross-referenced with city maps and communal inhabitants address data. However, the paper will not disclose scientific progress in Earth Observation and GIS, but will actually demonstrate that a new combination of existing methods is required to support actual data needs for improved refugee management and integration. The examples show that EO/GIS cannot only theoretically provide societal benefits. The results can play an important role in factual political, administrative and humanitarian day-to-day reality.",NA,NA,10.1127/pfg/2016/0308,included,NA
Climate Data For The European Forestry Sector: From End-User Needs To Opportunities For Climate Resilience,"The aim of this study is to assess the potential of Earth Observation and climate data for the forestry sector focusing on the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Although forestry researchers recognize the importance of Earth Observation and climate data, forestry practitioners currently work mainly with land cover information, largely neglecting climate data. Understanding its potential for the forestry sector becomes thus important, as to align the vast offer of climate services in Europe to different forestry users and stakeholders' necessities. Interviews, surveys, and dedicated workshops were used to collect a series of forestry end-users' needs and requirements regarding climate data. End-user's requirements were categorized through a SWOT analysis, which allowed to identify perceived internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats to the increased use of the C3S. Results indicate that improved climate services for the forestry sector based on C3S data would benefit from enhanced training on the use of climate data, improved provision of services integrating climate with non-climate data, the provision of new variables and indicators, and the integration of machine learning techniques for developing data and information in support of the deployment of climate services. These findings are relevant to close the gap between demand and supply of climate services for the forestry sector and provide a basis for further exploring the value of climate data in serving a wide array of forestry stakeholders. Going forward, increased knowledge on user requirements from both forest practitioners and policy-makers can be beneficial to develop accessible tailored services.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100247,included,NA
Estimating The Societal Benefits Of Satellite Instruments: Application To A Break-Even Analysis Of The Geoxo Hyperspectral Ir Sounder,"This paper describes the process, and lessons learned in a preliminary benefits study of a proposed infrared hyperspectral sounder (HSS) for NOAA's next generation geostationary satellite program (GeoXO). The valuation of government-owned satellite systems providing a public good with a complex array of instruments is a nascent field of study. Many different sensor configurations are possible, but there are restrictions due to physical and budget constraints. Accounting for economic considerations during the design and planning phase for satellite constellations helps to ensure that the most cost effective instruments are selected. To assess whether the HSS instrument should be included on GeoXO, we applied a value of information approach and found the benefits associated with this instrument are likely to substantially outweigh the costs. Value of information studies often focus on data and information that has a direct use case. Estimating benefits for the HSS is especially challenging because data are not used directly by decision makers. Instead these data along with information from other Earth observing (EO) satellites play a key role in producing the inputs necessary for modern numerical hydrometeorological modeling. We describe strategies to assess the marginal (i.e., incremental) contribution of an instrument that is part of a complex information production process. We make several recommendations that, if implemented, would improve the quality of future studies of this kind. This includes (1) a systems approach to observing system planning, (2) improving the design of observing system experiments (OSSE and OSE), and (3) better tracking of the decisions and needs of end-users, especially those external to the agency.",NA,NA,10.3389/fenvs.2021.749044,included,NA
How Valuable Is Remotely Sensed Information? The Case Of Tropical Deforestation Modelling,"An economic approach to remote-sensing applications needs to be developed to demonstrate the cost-advantage ratio of Earth observation for decision makers. This article aims to conduct such an analysis of the information derived by remote sensing for a specific operational project, following some general chemical consideration about the economic value the economic value of information highlight that: of information. In our study of tropical deforestation modelling the main advantages of the remote-sensing-based information system came from: (i) an improvement of decision making as decisions could be made with a higher degree of confidence, leading to a shorter and less expensive decision cycle, and to earlier implementation of decisions; and (ii) avoidance of bad bad decisions, as the rate of project failure, and the associated resource wastes, was expected to decrease as a result of the availability of more accurate information. The costs of the model development and calibration and model implementation are also discussed. The economic approach is then generalised to three generic categories of remote-sensing projects (private, public with short-term implications and public with long-term implications).

Advanced Processing Of Multiplatform Remote Sensing Imagery For The Monitoring Of Coastal And Mountain Ecosystems,"Coastal areas are key to sustaining biodiversity, but their complexity and variability makes their analysis challenging. On the other hand, mountain ecosystems include a large percentage of the global biodiversity and their monitoring is essential, as they are especially vulnerable to climate change. In this context, remote sensing offers a cost-effective technology for the conservation of both kinds of natural areas. In this work, multispectral and hyperspectral data recorded by sensors, onboard satellites, aircrafts and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), have been used for the sustainable management of natural resources. Specifically, a multiplatform methodology has been developed to process multisensor high spatial resolution imagery and the main benefits and drawbacks of each technology have been identified. Advanced processing techniques in each stage of the methodology have been selected to provide accurate and validated benthic and vegetation maps. Two challenging ecosystems, located in Cabrera and Teide National Parks, have been selected for this study. They correspond with a coastal and a mountain island ecosystem, respectively. To address the associated challenges, the use of imagery with the maximum spatial and spectral resolution, provided by Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, CASI and Pika-L, has been considered. Results have been validated with in-situ data and by the National Parks' managers and they have shown the ability of remote sensing to accurately map both Parks when the appropriate imagery and techniques are selected. The best performance was achieved with the Support Vector Machine classifier and, in general, WorldView can be considered the most appropriate platform when factoring in cost, coverage and accuracy.",NA,NA,10.1109/access.2020.3046657,included,NA
A Review Of Approaches For Automated Habitat Mapping And Their Potential Added Value For Biodiversity Monitoring Projects,"Habitats are important indicators of biodiversity in their own right, as well as being linked to species, hence their widespread use in reporting on nature conservation planning and policy. For reporting consistent mapping and monitoring habitat extent and change is important. Remote Sensing techniques are becoming an important tool for this. In this paper we describe four examples of methods of semi-automated mapping using Remote Sensing. Because the most effective way of improving the accuracy of the estimation of habitat area is by increasing the sample number, it is important to develop methods for reducing in situ surveys which are expensive. Remote Sensing has the major advantage of comprehensive coverage and the four examples illustrate the potential of extrapolation from semi-automated habitat classifications. The potential for using these methods at national scales is likely to be limited by the need for validation of the automated images and the subsequent calculation of error terms. Existing major national monitoring programs are described, which still use mainly traditional in situ methods. The selection of relatively small numbers of representative samples from environmental classifications to obtain regional estimates reduces the need for large numbers of in situ survey sites and is therefore discussed. The recent development of the use of drones to acquire detailed imagery to support in situ habitat surveys is also covered. Finally, practical problems linked to the methods described in the paper are considered, as in some cases these will override the theoretical benefits of a particular approach. It is concluded that automated methods can enhance existing monitoring systems and should be considered in any biodiversity monitoring system as they represent an opportunity for reducing costs, if integrated with an in situ program. © 2019 Sciendo.

Digitalization And Agricultural Development: Evidence From Morocco,"The agricultural sector plays a major role in the socio-economic development of several countries around the world, including African countries. Advances induced by digital innovation have positively impacted this sector and could have a considerable impact by reducing the risk of food insecurity. In this chapter, applied research experiences conducted in Morocco have been reported to highlight some of the opportunities that digital transformation can offer in agriculture. First, agricultural land management was approached through remote monitoring of agricultural land and mapping of cropland using satellite imageries and machine learning. Then, the question of what digital can offer for the management of agricultural water resources was discussed through two examples: the first deals with the use of remote sensing and modeling to support irrigation water management; and the second is related to another aspect of multi-year bioeconomic modeling for predicting changes in water management indicators. Finally, experiences on the importance of digital transformation in risk management were discussed in order to analyze the risks in a more informed way and to relate aspects that could not be connected before in the past, in an efficient and relevant manner. Indeed, an experiment on the evaluation of spatial variability of wheat yield has been reported and an example of the spatial analysis of risk related to losses in production value using satellite data was discussed. With steps added or substituted compared to the research presented in this chapter, digital innovation allows precise monitoring of agricultural land and offers socio-economic conditions that are more advantageous for farmers. Overall, all of the experiences cited on the use of digital innovation in the agriculture sector can be extended to other contexts, particularly in Africa where sustainable agricultural development remains the ultimate goal. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Detection And Mapping The Spatial Distribution Of Bracken Fern Weeds Using The Landsat 8 Oli New Generation Sensor,"Bracken fern is an invasive plant that presents serious environmental, ecological and economic problems around the world. An understanding of the spatial distribution of bracken fern weeds is therefore essential for providing appropriate management strategies at both local and regional scales. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the freely available medium resolution Landsat 8 OLI sensor in the detection and mapping of bracken fern at the Cathedral Peak, South Africa. To achieve this objective, the results obtained from Landsat 8 OLI were compared with those derived using the costly, high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery. Since previous studies have already Successfully mapped bracken fern using high spatial resolution WorldView-2 image, the comparison was done to investigate the magnitude of difference in accuracy between the two sensors in relation to their acquisition costs. To evaluate the performance of Landsat 8 OLI in discriminating bracken fern compared to that of Worldview-2, we tested the utility of (i) spectral bands; (ii) derived vegetation indices as well as (iii) the combinatidn of spectral bands and vegetation indices based on discriminant analysis classification algorithm. After resampling the training and testing data and reclassifying several times (n =100) based on the combined data sets, the overall accuracies for both Landsat 8 and WorldView-2 were tested for significant differences based on Mann-Whitney U test. The results showed that the integration of the spectral bands and derived vegetation indices yielded the best overall classification accuracy (80.08\% and 87.80\% for Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 respectively). Additionally, the use of derived vegetation indices as a standalone data set produced the weakest overall accuracy results of 62.14\% and 82.11\% for both the Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 images. There were significant differences \{U (100) = 569.5, z = -10.8242, p < 0.01\} between the classification accuracies derived based on Landsat OLI 8 and those derived using WorldView-2 sensor. Although there were significant differences between Landsat and WorldView-2 accuracies, the magnitude of variation (9\%) between the two sensors was within an acceptable range. Therefore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the recently launched Landsat 8 OLI mtiltispectral sensor provides valuable information that could aid in the long term continuous monitoring and formulation of effective bracken fern management with acceptable accuracies that are comparable to those obtained from the high resolution WorldView-2 commercial sensor.

Optimal Decision-Making Model Of Spatial Sampling For Survey Of China's Land With Remotely Sensed Data,"In the remote sensing survey of the country land, cost and accuracy are a pair of conflicts, for which spatial sampling is a preferable solution with the aim of an optimal balance between economic input and accuracy of results, or in other words, acquirement of higher accuracy at less cost. Counter to drawbacks of previous application models, e.g. lack of comprehensive and quantitative-comparison, the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is proposed. This model first acquires the possible accuracy-cost diagrams of multiple schemes through initial spatial exploration, then regresses them and standardizes them into a unified reference frame, and finally produces the relatively optimal sampling scheme by using the discrete decision-making function (built by this paper) and comparing them in combination with the diagrams. According to the test result in the survey of the arable land using remotely sensed data, the Sandwich model, while applied in the survey of the thin-feature and cultivated land areas with aerial photos, can better realize the goal of the best balance between investment and accuracy. With this case and other cases, it is shown that the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is a good choice in the survey of the farm areas using remote sensing, with its distinguished benefit of higher precision at less cost or vice versa. In order to extensively apply the model in the surveys of natural resources, including arable farm areas, this paper proposes the prototype of development using the component technology, that could considerably improve the analysis efficiency by insetting program components within the software environment of GIS and RS.",NA,NA,10.1360/03yd0376,included,NA
The Advantages Of Using Drones Over Space-Borne Imagery In The Mapping Of Mangrove Forests,"Satellite data and aerial photos have proved to be useful in efficient conservation and management of mangrove ecosystems. However, there have been only very few attempts to demonstrate the ability of drone images, and none so far to observe vegetation (specieslevel) mapping. The present study compares the utility of drone images (DJI-Phantom-2 with SJ4000 RGB and IR cameras, spatial resolution: 5cm) and satellite images (Pleiades-1B, spatial resolution: 50cm) for mangrove mapping-specifically in terms of image quality, efficiency and classification accuracy, at the Setiu Wetland in Malaysia. Both object- and pixel-based classification approaches were tested (QGIS v.2.12.3 with Orfeo Toolbox). The object-based classification (using a manual rule-set algorithm) of drone imagery with dominant land-cover features (i.e. water, land, Avicennia alba, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata and Casuarina equisetifolia) provided the highest accuracy (overall accuracy (OA): 94.0 +/- 0.5\% and specific producer accuracy (SPA): 97.0 +/- 9.3\%) as compared to the Pleiades imagery (OA: 72.2 +/- 2.7\% and SPA: 51.9 +/- 22.7\%). In addition, the pixel-based classification (using a maximum likelihood algorithm) of drone imagery provided better accuracy (OA: 90.0 +/- 1.9\% and SPA: 87.2 +/- 5.1\%) compared to the Pleiades (OA: 82.8 +/- 3.5\% and SPA: 80.4 +/- 14.3\%). Nevertheless, the drone provided higher temporal resolution images, even on cloudy days, an exceptional benefit when working in a humid tropical climate. In terms of the user-costs, drone costs are much higher, but this becomes advantageous over satellite data for long-term monitoring of a small area. Due to the large data size of the drone imagery, its processing time was about ten times greater than that of the satellite image, and varied according to the various image processing techniques employed (in pixel-based classification, drone >50 hours, Pleiades <5 hours), constituting the main disadvantage of UAV remote sensing. However, the mangrove mapping based on the drone aerial photos provided unprecedented results for Setiu, and was proven to be a viable alternative to satellite-based monitoring/management of these ecosystems. The improvements of drone technology will help to make drone use even more competitive in the future.",NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0200288,included,NA
Influence Of Spatial Resolution On Satellite-Based Pm2.5 Estimation: Implications For Health Assessment,"Satellite-based PM2.5 estimation has been widely used to assess health impact associated with PM2.5 exposure and might be affected by spatial resolutions of satellite input data, e.g., aerosol optical depth (AOD). Here, based on Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD in 2020 over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and three PM2.5 retrieval models, i.e., the mixed effects model (ME), the land-use regression model (LUR) and the Random Forest model (RF), we compare these model performances at different spatial resolutions (1, 3, 5 and 10 km). The PM2.5 estimations are further used to investigate the impact of spatial resolution on health assessment. Our cross-validated results show that the model performance is not sensitive to spatial resolution change for the ME and LUR models. By contrast, the RF model can create a more accurate PM2.5 prediction with a finer AOD spatial resolution. Additionally, we find that annual population-weighted mean (PWM) PM2.5 concentration and attributable mortality strongly depend on spatial resolution, with larger values estimated from coarser resolution. Specifically, compared to PWM PM2.5 at 1 km resolution, the estimation at 10 km resolution increases by 7.8%, 22.9%, and 9.7% for ME, LUR, and RF models, respectively. The corresponding increases in mortality are 7.3%, 18.3%, and 8.4%. Our results also show that PWM PM2.5 at 10 km resolution from the three models fails to meet the national air quality standard, whereas the estimations at 1, 3 and 5 km resolutions generally meet the standard. These findings suggest that satellite-based health assessment should consider the spatial resolution effect. © 2022 by the authors.

Grid-Scale Agricultural Land And Water Management: A Remote-Sensing-Based Multiobjective Approach,"This paper developed a remote-sensing-based multiobjective (RSM) approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale. To meet the spatial resolution and accuracy need of agricultural management, downscaled precipitation data sets were obtained with the help of global precipitation measurement (GPM) data and other spatial information. Spatial crop water requirement information were obtained via the combination use of the Penman-Monteith method, remote sensing information (MOD16/PET) and virtual water theory. Through integrating these spatial data and considering the impact of different spatial environments on crop growth, a grid-based integer multiobjective programming (GIMP) model was developed to determine best suitable crop planting types at all grids. GIMP can simultaneously consider several conflicting objectives: crop growth suitability, crop spatial water requirements, and ecosystem service value. Further, GIMP results were inputted into a grid-based nonlinear fractional multiobjective programming (GNFMP) model with three objectives: maximize economic benefits, maximize water productivity, and minimize blue water utilization, to optimize irrigation-water allocation. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, a realworld application in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China was conducted. Results show that the proposed method can improve the ecosystem service value by 0.36 x 10(8) CNY, the economic benefit by 21.85\%, the irrigation-water productivity by 25.92\%, and reduce blue water utilization rate by 24.32\% comparing with status quo.

"Economic Comparison Of Satellite, Plane And Uav-Acquired Ndvi Images For Site-Specific Nitrogen Application: Observations From Italy","Defining the most profitable remote sensing platforms is a difficult decision-making process, as it requires agronomic and economic considerations. In this paper, the price and profitability of three levels of remote sensing platforms were evaluated to define a decision-making process. Prices of satellite, plane and UAV-acquired vegetation indices were collected in Italy during 2020 and compared to the economic benefits resulting from variable rate nitrogen application, according to a bibliographic meta-analysis performed on grains. The quality comparison of these three technologies was performed considering the error propagation in the NDVI formula. The errors of the single bands were used to assess the optical properties of the sensors. Results showed that medium-resolution satellite data with good optical properties could be profitably used for variable rate nitrogen applications starting from 2.5 hectares, in case of medium resolution with good optical properties. High-resolution satellites with lower optical quality were profitable starting from 13.2 hectares, while very high-resolution satellites with good optical properties could be profitably used starting from 76.8 hectares. Plane-acquired images, which have good optical properties, were profitable starting from 66.4 hectares. Additionally, a reference model for satellite image price is proposed.",NA,NA,10.3390/agronomy11112098,included,NA
Key Technologies Of Monitoring High Temperature Stress To Rice By Portable Uav Multi Spectral Remote Sensing,"Rice is an important cereal crop in the world and the most important food resource in China. Under the background of global warming, the degree and frequency of extreme high temperature heat waves are also increasing. From July to August every year, continuous high temperature weather with daily maximum temperature exceeding 35.0℃ often occurs in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River affected by subtropical high. At this time, rice is in a sensitive period of growth and development, and continuous high temperature will seriously influences the physiological development of rice. Consequently, scientific and reasonable monitoring of the occurrence and development process of high temperature stress to rice is of great scientific significance and practical value for impact assessment of rice yield variation and agricultural production decisions in the context of global warming. At present, crop growth monitoring methods mainly rely on field investigation and satellite remote sensing. However, the traditional field investigation methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the accuracy is also influenced by the subjective consciousness of investigators. In addition, satellite remote sensing also has some shortcomings, such as low spatial resolution, long transit period, cloud pollution and so on. So, the application technology research of real-time monitoring of crop growth using multi-spectral sensors carried by portable drones is an important supplement and improvement to the existing monitoring and investigation methods for high temperature stress to rice. In this paper, a remote sensing monitoring system for rice growth and data post-processing analysis and application methods were designed based on consumer-grade drones and portable multi-spectral sensors, and then Wuhu super rice production base in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river was selected as the experimental area, and the continuous high temperature days from July 20 to August 9, 2019 was taken as the experimental period. Experimental results showed that there was a significant exponential relationship between the rice vegetation index and the leaf area index, with the correlation coefficient of 0.918, and then the inversion model of rice leaf area index was established. Finally, the discrimination conditions of leaf area index of rice under high temperature stress were further determined. The inversion model and discrimination conditions of leaf area index were used to extract and to analyze the spectral characteristics of rice under high temperature stress in the experimental area. During this continuous high temperature period, 15.3% of rice in the experimental area was damaged by the continuous high temperature stress, which is coincided with the reality from the field investigation conducted by agricultural department (i.e., the grain filling rate of rice was 82.2% in the experimental area). Compared with the traditional field survey and satellite remote sensing monitoring methods, the portable UAV multispectral remote sensing monitoring technology developed in this paper has advantages of high spatial resolution, real-time and large-scale monitoring and application of low cost, which is conducive to the popularization and promotion. It has a certain application prospect in the remote sensing monitoring of crop natural disasters. © 2020 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

Water Balance Estimation Of A Poorly Gauged Catchment In West Africa Using Dynamically Downscaled Meteorological Fields And Remote Sensing Information,"Scientifically sound decisions in sustainable water management are usually based on hydrological modeling which can only be accomplished by meteorological driving information. Especially in regions with weak infrastructure this task is hampered by limited hydro-meteorological information in sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. We investigated three approaches to provide required meteorological fields driving the distributed hydrological model: the results of the mesoscale meteorological model MM5 which are available near real time, the TRMM product 3B42 available with approximately one month delay, and station data available with a delay of one year or more. The study site is the White Volta catchment in the semi-arid environment of West Africa. The results for 2004 show that the meteorological model is able to provide meteorological input data for near real time water balance estimations. In this study the TRMM product does not improve the simulation results. Besides missing important meteorological data, also gridded information on land surface properties (albedo, LAI, etc.) is usually difficult to obtain, albeit it is an essential input for distributed hydrological models. This information is commonly taken from ""static"" tables depending on the land use. Satellite remote sensing provides worldwide spatially detailed information on land surface properties which is particularly suitable for large regions in remote settings. Therefore the MODIS products for albedo and LAI were processed to annual time series including the identification and replacement of low quality observations by interpolation. The impact using MODIS data on the spatial distribution of water balance variables occurs mainly on local scale. The hydrological simulations using MODIS LAI and albedo values result in higher annual evapotranspiration and lower total discharge sums for 2004. Altogether it is concluded that hydrological decision support systems in regions with weak infrastructure can benefit significantly from the integration of atmospheric modeling and satellite-derived land surface data. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mapping Crop Fractional Green Canopy Cover Using High Spatial Resolution Thermal And Optical Remote Sensing In Southern Ontario, Canada","Fractional green canopy cover (FGCC) is a commonly used diagnostic parameter to describe plant growth and vitality. Remote sensing estimates of crop FGCC have been used to support a wide range of agricultural applications, including the assessment of management practices designed to promote crop productivity and maintain environmental sustainability. This study investigated the potential of using affordable thermal and optical remote sensing sensors to map FGCC at the Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada experimental farm located in Woodslee, Ontario, Canada. Airborne RGB (red-green-blue) colour and thermal images and ground-level red-edge images were collected in August 2019 over crop fields with different treatment plots. The 20 cm resolution RGB images and 5 cm red-edge images were used to extract reference data for FGCC, which were then linked to thermal data and red-edge vegetation indices. We found that the airborne thermal data explained 77% of the variation in FGCC at a range of 0%–100%. However, the airborne thermal image could only explain 17% of the variation within the cornfields, which had low FGCC values, ranging from 20% to 40%. In contrast, the simple ratio derived from the ground-level red-edge image explained 81% of the FGCC variation in the cornfields. These results suggest that both thermal and red-edge images are capable of estimating crop FGCC, with the red-edge outperforming the thermal images in estimating low FGCC for single-crop fields. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an efficient and affordable means to map crop FGCC, which could play an essential role in generating insights related to crop canopy development, light interception, and evapotranspiration partitioning, which can be used as indicators for soil health and nutrient status. © Canadian Science Publishing.

Monitoring Water-Related Ecosystems With Earth Observation Data In Support Of Sustainable Development Goal (Sdg) 6 Reporting,"Lack of national data on water-related ecosystems is a major challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 targets by 2030. Monitoring surface water extent, wetlands, and water quality from space can be an important asset for many countries in support of SDG 6 reporting. We demonstrate the potential for Earth observation (EO) data to support country reporting for SDG Indicator 6.6.1, 'Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time' and identify important considerations for countries using these data for SDG reporting. The spatial extent of water-related ecosystems, and the partial quality of water within these ecosystems is investigated for seven countries. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5, 7, and 8 with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used to measure surface water extent at 250 m and 30 m spatial resolution, respectively, in Cambodia, Jamaica, Peru, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia. The extent of mangroves is mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1, and SRTM data for Jamaica, Peru, and Senegal. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A imagery, total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are mapped over time for a select number of large surface water bodies in Peru, Senegal, and Zambia. All of the EO datasets used are of global coverage and publicly available at no cost. The temporal consistency and long time-series of many of the datasets enable replicability over time, making reporting of change from baseline values consistent and systematic. We find that statistical comparisons between different surface water data products can help provide some degree of confidence for countries during their validation process and highlight the need for accuracy assessments when using EO-based land change data for SDG reporting. We also raise concern that EO data in the context of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting may be more challenging for some countries, such as small island nations, than others to use in assessing the extent of water-related ecosystems due to scale limitations and climate variability. Country-driven validation of the EO data products remains a priority to ensure successful data integration in support of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. Multi-country studies such as this one can be valuable tools for helping to guide the evolution of SDG monitoring methodologies and provide a useful resource for countries reporting on water-related ecosystems. The EO data analyses and statistical methods used in this study can be easily replicated for country-driven validation of EO data products in the future.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs12101634,included,NA
Applying Bag Of Words Approach To Determine Remote Sensing Technology Acceptance Among Smallholder Plantations,"Purpose: Technology acceptance is a measure of that technology’s usefulness. Oil palm is one of the biggest contributors to Indonesia’s revenues, thus fueling its economy. Using remote sensing would allow a plantation to monitor and forecast its production and the amount of fertilizer used. This review aims to provide a policy recommendation in the form of a strategy to improve the added value of Indonesia’s oil palm and support the government in increasing oil palm production. This recommendation needs to be formulated by determining the users’ acceptance of remote sensing technology (state-owned plantations, private plantation companies and smallholder plantations). Design/methodology/approach: This review’s methodology used sentiment analysis through text mining (bag of words model). The study’s primary data were from focus group discussions (FGDs), questionnaires, observations on participants, audio-visual documentation and focused discussions based on group category. The results of interviews and FGDs were transcribed into text and analyzed to 1) find words that can represent the content of the document; 2) classify and determine the frequency (word cloud); and finally 3) analyze the sentiment. Findings: The result showed that private plantation companies and state-owned plantations had extremely high positive sentiments toward using remote sensing in their oil palm plantations, whereas smallholders had a 60% resistance. However, there is still a possibility for this technology’s adoption by smallholders, provided it is free and easily applied. Research limitations/implications: Basically, technology is applied to make work easier. However, not everyone is tech-savvy, especially the older generations. One dimension of technology acceptance is user/customer retention. New technology would not be immediately accepted, but there would be user perceptions about its uses and ease. At first, people might be reluctant to accept a new technology due to the perception that it is useless and difficult. Technology acceptance is the gauge of how useful technology is in making work easier compared to conventional ways. Practical implications: Therefore, technology acceptance needs to be improved among smallholders by intensively socializing the policies, and through dissemination and dedication by academics and the government. Social implications: The social implications of using technology are reducing the workforce, but the company will be more profitable and efficient. Originality/value: Remote sensing is one of the topics that people have not taken up in a large way, especially sentiment analysis. Acceptance of technology that utilizes remote sensing for plantations is very useful and efficient. In the end, company profits can be allocated more toward empowering the community and the environment. © 2023, Shinta Rahma Diana and Farida Farida.",NA,NA,10.1108/agjsr-02-2023-0056,included,NA
Ground Level Lidar As A Contributing Indicator In An Environmental Protection Application,"The value attributed to the forests in developed countries has shifted from commercial wood production towards carbon reduction, habitat for wildlife, scenery and recreation. With the increasing perceived benefits came more concern and effort towards better forest management.

Measuring The Economic Benefits Of Advanced Technology Use For River Flood Forecasting,"As part of the Hudson Bay drainage system in North America, the Red River of the North Basin (RRB) has been subject to Spring River flooding in the past century. Previously, forecast errors had led to inadequate flood preparations that resulted in tremendous losses and overspending of taxpayer's dollars in flood response. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's satellite microwave remote sensing technology offers improved snow water equivalent measurement information needed for spring flood forecasting in this region. This study evaluates the economic benefits of the technology use to the farm sector in the RRB. We found that farm support for the technology use for river flood forecast is overwhelming, and higher farm support yields higher willingness to pay for the product use. However, respondents who are content with the existing spring flood forecasts tend to have a lower valuation of the new product. Tellingly, landowners who lease to farm operators have noticeably zero perceived economic valuation of the product even though river flooding on their land could depress future land value.",NA,NA,10.1111/jfr3.12781,included,NA
Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Sebal Algorithm Integrated With Remote Sensing And Experimental Methods,"Evapotranspiration is one of the most important elements of the hydrological cycle. Estimation of evapotranspiration is imperative for effective forest, irrigation, rangeland and water resources management as well as to increase yields and for better crop management. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in estimating evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of corn in the Mediterranean region of Adana province, Turkey. The Landsat 8 satellite images from March to September 2018 were used to acquire the coefficients of the respective bands. Then, the net radiation flux on the earth's surface and the earth's heat flux is obtained using incoming-outgoing radiation fluxes from albedo, surface emissivity coefficients, land surface temperature, and plant indicators. Next, the sensible heat flux is calculated by determining the hot and cold pixels under consideration via the atmospheric stability conditions. Finally, evapotranspiration maps are plotted. The crop coefficient of corn is also estimated with the respected maps being plotted. To validate the outcomes from the SEBAL algorithm, experimental methods were employed to calculate the evapotranspiration values and evaluated using suitable performance metrics. The results showed that the SEBAL generated evapotranspiration values are in high agreement with the FAO Penman-Monteith method registering the highest correlation (R = 0.91) and the lowest error (RMSE = 1.14). In addition, the SEBAL method registered the highest correlation values of 0.89, 0.87 and 0.68 with Turk, Makkink and Hargreaves experimental methods, respectively. Moreover, the crop coefficients estimated using SEBAL also manifested an acceptable correlation with all methods. The highest correlation value registered was with the FAO Penman-Monteith method (R = 0.98). The outcomes show that since the performance of the SEBAL algorithm in estimating the actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient using Landsat 8 satellite images is acceptable, the SEBAL algorithm could be a very convenient method. Moreover, it could easily be assimilated into farming management systems and precision agriculture for better decision-making and higher yield.",NA,NA,10.1080/17538947.2021.1962996,included,NA
Spaceborne Imaging Spectroscopy For Sustainable Agriculture: Contributions And Challenges,"Agriculture faces the challenge of providing food, fibre and energy from limited land resources to satisfy the changing needs of a growing world population. Global megatrends, e.g., climate change, influence environmental production factors; production and consumption thus must be continuously adjusted to maintain the producer-consumer-equilibrium in the global food system. While, in some parts of the world, smallholder farming still is the dominant form of agricultural production, the use of digital information for the highly efficient cultivation of large areas has become part of agricultural practice in developed countries. Thereby, the use of satellite data to support site-specific management is a major trend. Although the most prominent use of satellite technology in farming still is navigation, Earth Observation is increasingly applied. Some operational services have been established, which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information. These services have mostly been boosted by the increased availability of multispectral imagery from NASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus programs, respectively. Using multispectral data has arrived in the agricultural commodity chain. Compared to multispectral data, spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling, often referred to as hyperspectral sensing, can potentially provide additional information and/or increased sampling accuracy. However, due to the lack of hyperspectral satellite systems with high spatial resolution, these advantages mostly are not yet used in practical farming. This paper summarizes where hyperspectral data provide additional value and information in an agricultural context. It lists the variables of interest and highlights the contribution of hyperspectral sensing for information-driven agriculture, preparing the application of future operational spaceborne hyperspectral missions.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10712-018-9492-0,included,NA

Uav Assisted Spatiotemporal Analysis And Management Of Bushfires: A Case Study Of The 2020 Victorian Bushfires,"Australia is a regular recipient of devastating bushfires that severely impacts its economy, landscape, forests, and wild animals. These bushfires must be managed to save a fortune, wildlife, and vegetation and reduce fatalities and harmful environmental impacts. The current study proposes a holistic model that uses a mixed-method approach of Geographical Information System (GIS), remote sensing, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based bushfire assessment and mitigation. The fire products of Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used for monitoring the burnt areas within the Victorian Region due to the 2020 bushfires. The results show that the aggregate of 1500 m produces the best output for estimating the burnt areas. The identified hotspots are in the eastern belt of the state that progressed north towards New South Wales. The R-2 values between 0.91-0.99 indicate the fitness of methods used in the current study. A healthy z-value index between 0.03 to 2.9 shows the statistical significance of the hotspots. Additional analysis of the 2019-20 Victorian bushfires shows a widespread radius of the fires associated with the climate change and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomenon. The UAV paths are optimized using five algorithms: greedy, intra route, inter route, tabu, and particle swarm optimization (PSO), where PSO search surpassed all the tested methods in terms of faster run time and lesser costs to manage the bushfires disasters. The average improvement demonstrated by the PSO algorithm over the greedy method is approximately 2\% and 1.2\% as compared with the intra route. Further, the cost reduction is 1.5\% compared with the inter-route scheme and 1.2\% compared with the intra route algorithm. The local disaster management authorities can instantly adopt the proposed system to assess the bushfires disasters and instigate an immediate response plan.",NA,NA,10.3390/fire4030040,included,NA
Assessing The Impact Of L-Band Observations On Drought And Flood Risk Estimation: A Decision-Theoretic Approach In An Osse Environment,"Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are often conducted to evaluate the worth of existing data and data yet to be collected from proposed new missions. As missions increasingly require a broader Earth systems focus, it is important that the OSSEs capture the potential benefits of the observations on end-use applications. Toward this end, the results from the OSSEs must also be evaluated with a suite of metrics that capture the value, uncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science and societal impacts. This article presents a soil moisture OSSE that employs simulated L-band measurements and assesses its utility toward improving drought and flood risk estimates using the NASA Land Information System (LIS). A decision-theory-based analysis is conducted to assess the economic utility of the observations toward improving these applications. The results suggest that the improvements in surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and total runoff fields obtained through the assimilation of L-band measurements are effective in providing improvements in the drought and flood risk assessments as well. The decision-theory analysis not only demonstrates the economic utility of observations but also shows that the use of probabilistic information from the model simulations is more beneficial compared to the use of corresponding deterministic estimates. The experiment also demonstrates the value of a comprehensive modeling environment such as LIS for conducting end-to-end OSSEs by linking satellite observations, physical models, data assimilation algorithms, and end-use application models in a single integrated framework.",NA,NA,10.1175/jhm-d-13-0204.1,included,NA
Testing And Validation Of Cloud Infrastructures For Earth Observation Services With Satellite Constellations,"Earth observation (EO) with satellites has been applied in different fields such as environment monitoring, natural disasters response, emergencies management, civil security, intelligence, maritime surveillance, and many others. Some of the application fields are very demanding in terms of system revisit time and product delivery time. This is the case of responses to natural disasters. However EO still presents critical challenges to overcome in order to cover the actual demand of services: (i) high revisit time, (ii) high response time, and (iii) easy and instant access to EO products. To increase the revisit time and broaden the applications of the remote sensing, new space concepts such as constellations and formations of satellites have been developed. However, the traditional ground infrastructures, which are required to process and store data, are expensive. Moreover, their limited scalability as well as their limited flexibility to manage large and variable amounts of imagery data shall also be considered. Along this work, we propose a cloud infrastructure for data management to be validated with a constellation of 17 satellites acquiring the Earth’s surface on a daily basis in order to offer high added value services for highly demanding applications. The satellites download the raw data images in a network of 12 ground stations distributed around the world to provide global coverage. The cloud system is based on previous works carried out by the research group. Thus the cloud infrastructure is tested and evaluated for its use in the EO sector and applied to different realistic scenarios, including an intensive comparison with a traditional system responding to the Lorca’s earthquake, which occurred in Spain in 2011. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2015.1070324,included,NA
Technological Innovations Bringing Spatial Technology To Precision Agriculture In The Northern Great Plains,"In addition to land, labor, and capital, which have long been agriculture's traditional assets, technology and information management has become the fourth asset of increasing importance and has come to be known as precision agriculture. Information of both spatial and temporal dimensions is required for precision agriculture. Remote sensing imagery acquired from satellites, aircrafts, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers tremendous potential in providing information in both dimensions for precision crop management. Of course, spatial data is valuable only to the extent that it is timely delivered and properly interpreted to drive decision making. To help regional producers benefit from recent advancements in spatial technology, we have innovated in multiple frontiers, including sensor technology, Internet data delivery, and knowledge diffusion. Airborne Environmental Research Observational Camera and International Space Station Agriculture Camera were developed to provide near real-time high-resolution imagery. Data acquired by the two sensors and those by satellites are delivered to users through Digital Northern Great Plains (DNGP) and a zone-mapping application for precision agriculture (ZoneMAP), the two systems that were designed to allow regional producers access to remote sensing data easily and efficiently. By creating a learning community, we lowered the barrier for end users to understand and learn the technologies effectively from peers as well as professionals. Through continuous innovative efforts, we have been helping the producers utilizing the spatial technology to increase profit while reducing waste for over one decade.",NA,NA,10.3727/194982414x13971392823271,included,NA
Big Data Analysis Applied In Agricultural Planting Layout Optimization,"Mile is a region in Yunnan Province, China. The planting-related industry is its pillar industry. Its agricultural population accounts for 59.3\% of the total population. Temporal fluctuations of crop price and yield have a significant influence on farmers' revenue. Farmers' selection of crop species, crop planting strategy, and agricultural planting layout according to the market price is important in securing their revenue. In this study, we used a web crawler program to obtain a large amount of data on agricultural product prices from the Internet. Then, the price fluctuation trend of the main economic crops was analyzed by using the K-means clustering method. The net investment yield and the Sharpe ratio were used to compare the economic benefits and investment risks of 10 crops and five cultivation strategies in Mile. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparative advantage index, which integrates the net investment yield, Sharpe ratio, scale advantage index, productivity advantage index, and ecological suitability advantage index, was adopted to comprehensively measure the advantages of crop cultivation. Finally, we propose a spatial-temporal big data analysis model based on the cuckoo search algorithm to optimize the spatial layout of the main crops in Mile in 2017. Based on the comparative analysis of the remote sensing monitoring results and the spatial optimization layout results of the main crops in 2017, several suggestions were given. The results based on agricultural big data analysis, such as crop selection cluster analysis, economic benefit analysis, and crop planting layout optimization, can give suggests to farmers plant suitable crops on right lands, in right time. Thus, it can help farmers stabilize their revenue and minimize the risk by choosing the right crops and planting strategy in accordance with the local conditions.",NA,NA,10.13031/aea.12790,included,NA
Remote Sensing For Assessing Landslides And Associated Hazards,"Multi-platform remote sensing using space-, airborne and ground-based sensors has become essential tools for landslide assessment and disaster-risk prevention. Over the last 30 years, the multiplicity of Earth Observation satellites mission ensures uninterrupted optical and radar imagery archives. With the popularization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, free optical and radar imagery with high revisiting time, ground and aerial possibilities to perform high-resolution 3D point clouds and derived digital elevation models, it can make it difficult to choose the appropriate method for risk assessment. The aim of this paper is to review the mainstream remote-sensing methods commonly employed for landslide assessment, as well as processing. The purpose is to understand how remote-sensing techniques can be useful for landslide hazard detection and monitoring taking into consideration several constraints such as field location or costs of surveys. First we focus on the suitability of terrestrial, aerial and spaceborne systems that have been widely used for landslide assessment to underline their benefits and drawbacks for data acquisition, processing and interpretation. Several examples of application are presented such as Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), lasergrammetry, Terrestrial Optical Photogrammetry. Some of these techniques are unsuitable for slow moving landslides, others limited to large areas and others to local investigations. It can be complicated to select the most appropriate system. Today, the key for understanding landslides is the complementarity of methods and the automation of the data processing. All the mentioned approaches can be coupled (from field monitoring to satellite images analysis) to improve risk management, and the real challenge is to improve automatic solution for landslide recognition and monitoring for the implementation of near real-time emergency systems.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10712-020-09609-1,included,NA
Using The Social Cost Of Carbon To Value Earth Observing Systems,"The goal of this study is to show how to quantify the benefits of accelerated learning about key parameters of the climatic system and use this knowledge to improve decision-making on climate policy. The US social cost of carbon (SCC) methodology is used in innovative ways to value new Earth observing systems (EOSs). The study departs from the strict US SCC methodology, and from previous work, in that net benefits are used instead of only damages to calculate the value of information of the enhanced systems. In other respects the US SCC methodology is followed closely. We compute the surfeit expected net benefits of learning the actionable information earlier, with the enhanced system, versus learning later with existing systems. The enhanced systems are designed to give reliable information about climate sensitivity on accelerated timescales relative to existing systems; therefore, the decision context stipulates that a global reduced emissions path would be deployed upon receiving suitable information on the rate of temperature rise with a suitable level of confidence. By placing the enhanced observing system in a decision context, the SCC enables valuing this system as a real option. Policy relevance Uncertainty in key parameters of the climatic system is often cited as a barrier for near-term reductions of carbon emissions. It is a truism among risk managers that uncertainty costs money, and its reduction has economic value. Advancing policy making under uncertainty requires valuing the reduction in uncertainty. Using CLARREO, a new proposed EOS,as an example, this article applies value of information/real option theory to value the reduction of uncertainty in the decadal rate of temperature rise. The US interagency social cost of carbon directive provides the decision context for the valuations. It is shown that the real option value of the uncertainty reduction, relative to existing observing systems, is a very large multiple of the new system's cost. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",NA,NA,10.1080/14693062.2015.1110109 and ce and real option value and social cost of carbon and value of in,included,NA
Resource Management In Rangeland,"Adequate assessments of vast expanses of rangeland-a primary prerequisite to effective conservation planning-require landscape-scale evaluations that accurately represent the resources (e.g., soil, vegetation, wildlife, water), the structure and function of the resource-providing systems, and the natural range of variation in measured resource condition indicators. We discuss why conventional rangeland survey methods are inadequate for this task and how geographic information systems, ground survey data, and high-altitude and/or satellite imagery can be used with 1-to 50-mm-resolution digital imagery and new software programs to make rangeland surveys more objective, repeatable, and cost effective. We then review example applications of rangeland surveys that we have conducted to answer specific landscape-scale management questions. The online exercise adds to the illustrated utility of these kinds of aerial surveys with hands-on examples of survey planning, database queries, and how to use commonly available software in data evaluation and analyses. © 2015 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,10.1201/b18173-15,included,NA
Accuracy And Impact Of Spatial Aids Based Upon Satellite Enumeration To Improve Indoor Residual Spraying Spatial Coverage,"Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a key tool in the fight to control, eliminate and ultimately eradicate malaria. IRS protection is based on a communal effect such that an individual's protection primarily relies on the community-level coverage of IRS with limited protection being provided by household-level coverage. To ensure a communal effect is achieved through IRS, achieving high and uniform community-level coverage should be the ultimate priority of an IRS campaign. Ensuring high community-level coverage of IRS in malaria-endemic areas is challenging given the lack of information available about both the location and number of households needing IRS in any given area. A process termed 'mSpray' has been developed and implemented and involves use of satellite imagery for enumeration for planning IRS and a mobile application to guide IRS implementation. This study assessed (1) the accuracy of the satellite enumeration and (2) how various degrees of spatial aid provided through the mSpray process affected community-level IRS coverage during the 2015 spray campaign in Zambia. Methods: A 2-stage sampling process was applied to assess accuracy of satellite enumeration to determine number and location of sprayable structures. Results indicated an overall sensitivity of 94\% for satellite enumeration compared to finding structures on the ground. Results: After adjusting for structure size, roof, and wall type, households in Nchelenge District where all types of satellite-based spatial aids (paper-based maps plus use of the mobile mSpray application) were used were more likely to have received IRS than Kasama district where maps used were not based on satellite enumeration. The probability of a household being sprayed in Nchelenge district where tablet-based maps were used, did not differ statistically from that of a household in Samfya District, where detailed paper-based spatial aids based on satellite enumeration were provided. Conclusion: IRS coverage from the 2015 spray season benefited from the use of spatial aids based upon satellite enumeration. These spatial aids can guide costly IRS planning and implementation leading to attainment of higher spatial coverage, and likely improve disease impact.",NA,NA,10.1186/s12936-018-2236-2,included,NA
"Comparing The Information Content Of Coral Reef Geomorphological And Biological Habitat Maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean","Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

"Assessing The Effects Of Severe Weather Events Through Remote Sensing On Samothrace, Greece: Applications For The Management Of Cultural Resources","This article demonstrates the utility of high temporal and spatial resolution satellite imagery for the detection and study of the effects of intense surface runoff, particularly in respect to mitigation efforts to protect archaeological sites. We make use of PlanetScope imagery, which has recently become available as a freely available remote sensing data source with a revisit time of less than 24 hours, almost global coverage, and spectral and spatial resolution on par with other commercially available sensors. The high temporal resolution of PlanetScope data allows for better detection of changes in land cover that are the result of severe weather events, whose effects may be cleared up within several days of occurring or are more pronounced in the immediate aftermath of disturbances. Focusing on two severe storms that struck the island of Samothrace, in the northern Aegean, on July 17 and September 25/26 2017 respectively and which caused considerable damage to local infrastructure and archaeological sites, we test the utility of these data for detecting the island-wide distribution of the effects of these weather events. We find that these data are sufficiently sensitive to detect and quantify the extent of surface runoff processes and argue that the detection and monitoring capabilities of these data provide a useful tool for outlining policies to mitigate future damages to cultural heritage sites.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.09.002,included,NA
"Digital Soil Texture Mapping And Spatial Transferability Of Machine Learning Models Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, And Terrain-Derived Covariates","Soil texture is an important property that controls the mobility of the water and nutrients in soil. This study examined the capability of machine learning (ML) models in estimating soil texture fractions using different combinations of remotely sensed data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and terrain-derived covariates (TDC) across two contrasting agroecological regions in Southwest Germany, Kraichgau and the Swabian Alb. Importantly, we tested the predictive power of three different ML models: the random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) coupled with the remote sensing data covariates. As expected, ML model performance was not consistent regarding the input covariates, soil texture fractions, and study regions. For example, in the Swabian Alb, the SVM model performed the best for the sand content with S2 + TDC (RMSE = 3.63\%, R-2 = 0.42), and XGB best predicted the clay content with S1 + S2 + TDC (RMSE = 6.84\%, R-2 = 0.64). In Kraichgau, the best models for sand (RMSE = 7.54\%, R-2 = 0.79) and clay contents (RMSE = 6.14\%, R-2 = 0.48) were obtained using XGB and SVM, respectively. Moreover, the results indicated that TDC were critical in estimating soil texture fractions, especially in Kraichgau, which indicated that topography plays an important role in defining the spatial distribution of soil properties. In contrast, the contribution of remote sensing data better predicted the silt and clay content in the Swabian Alb. The transferability of a region-specific model to the other region was low as indicated by poor predictive performance. The resulting soil-texture-fraction maps could be a significant source of information for efficient land resource management and environmental monitoring. Nonetheless, further research to evaluate the added value of the Sentinel imagery and to better analyze the spatial transferability of machine learning models is highly recommended.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14235909,included,NA
"Correlation Of Publication Frequency Of Newspaper Articles With Environment And Public Health Issues In Fire-Prone Peatland Regions Of Riau In Sumatra, Indonesia","Forest fires in peatlands emit pollutants to the atmosphere, affecting public health.

Using the database of a local newspaper, Riau Pos, in Riau Province of Sumatra, Indonesia, we have studied spatiotemporal correlations between publication frequency of newspaper articles mentioning search terms relevant to health issues and Fire Radiation Power (FRP) of peatland fires. FRP from one of the NASA satellite databases has been used as an index of air pollution caused by peatland fires. Visibility data for airport operation were also used as an index of particulate matter concentrations.

Applications Of Geospatial Technologies For Precision Agriculture,"Agriculture remains one of the most important concerns for sustainable livelihood and employment. Precision Agriculture (PA) offers a sustainable management solution to meet the increasingly high demand of food and raw materials. PA is also believed to increase safety of the environment, reduce climate change effects, and improve food security. Farmers need to make timely decisions throughout the agricultural life cycle, that is, from paddock to plate. Crop management (from sowing till harvesting) is an important component of this cycle and needs apt decision by the farmers. Such decisions must be timely and precise, for example, how much of weedicide needs to be sprayed and where exactly in the fields it is needed. Geospatial technologies assist in identifying variabilities in soil, weather, water, and crop performance. These are important crop limiting factors and need to be addressed through various management operations. Geospatial technologies in combination with Internet of Things (IoT) guides farmers not only to identify these factors but also provide support in making optimal decisions. This process makes agriculture a digital entity and thus provides considerable information about the land characteristics of individual farms. Remotely sensed imagery is frequently used for mapping agricultural land use, crop yield prediction, and stress monitoring. Remote and in-situ sensors have been developed and used for mapping and monitoring of soil and water characteristics such as electrical conductivity, soil moisture, and microclimate of plants. This information is transformed into knowledge through using machine learning techniques. The potential of these machine learning techniques to monitor various types of crop stresses has been explored to a large extent during past 10 years and more recently deep learning techniques are being developed owing to the rapid advancements in computing capabilities. This chapter, firstly, introduces the need of PA in response to economic and environmental impacts of increased food production to feed about eight billion people. While introducing its need, we argue that PA needs to be adopted as a management philosophy. Secondly, enabling geospatial technologies including Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) has been discussed in relation to their utility in PA. After giving the reader an idea about the magnitude of data obtained using GIS and RS techniques, big data analytics have been presented to show its potential for operationalizing PA. Thirdly, a state-of-the-art conceptual system of PA is described along with the practical use of geospatial technologies for its various components with practical examples from Australian Center for International Agriculture Research's (ACIAR) funded projects. However, the user can be doubtful when it comes to data sharing. Lastly, survey results have been shared with the readers to apprise them of the use of technology in agriculture relevant to PA components. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Managing Agricultural Water Considering Water Allocation Priority Based On Remote Sensing Data,"To fairly distribute limited irrigation water resources in arid regions, a water allocation priority evaluation method based on remote sensing data was proposed and integrated with an optimization model. First, the water supply response unit was divided according to canal system conditions. Then, a spatialization method was used for generating spatial agricultural output value (income from planting industry) and grain yield (yield of food crops) with the help of NDVI and the potential yield of farmland. Third, the AHP-TOPSIS method was employed to calculate the water allocation priority based on the above information. Finally, the evaluation results were integrated with a nonlinear multiobjective model to optimally allocate agricultural land and water resources, considering the combined objective of minimum envy and proportional fairness. The method was applied to Hetao irrigation area, an arid agriculture-dominant region in Northwest China. After solving the model, optimization alternatives were obtained, which indicate that: (1) the spatial method of agricultural output value can improve the accuracy by around 16\% compared with the traditional method, and the spatial method of grain yield also have good accuracy (MAPE = 14.66\%); (2) the rank of water allocation priority can reflect more spatial information, and provide practical decision support for the distribution of water resources; (3) the envy index can better improve the efficiency of an allocation system compared to the Gini coefficient method.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs13081536,included,NA
Mapping Of Potential Fuel Regions Using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles For Wildfire Prevention,"This paper presents a comprehensive forest mapping system using a customized drone payload equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), cameras, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The goal is to develop an efficient solution for collecting accurate forest data in dynamic environments and to highlight potential wildfire regions of interest to support precise forest management and conservation on the ground. Our paper provides a detailed description of the hardware and software components of the system, covering sensor synchronization, data acquisition, and processing. The overall system implements simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, particularly Fast LiDAR Inertial Odometry with Scan Context (FASTLIO-SC), and LiDAR Inertial Odometry Smoothing and Mapping (LIOSAM), for accurate odometry estimation and map generation.

Bioclimatic Variables From Precipitation And Temperature Records Vs. Remote Sensing-Based Bioclimatic Variables: Which Side Can Perform Better In Species Distribution Modeling?,"Bioclimatic variables are considered as an indispensable data type in species distribution modeling. Such variables are available from the WorldClim database for the entire earth surface and at various spatial resolutions. Moreover, convenient access to real-time satellite data and their products has recently created a new way to produce environmental variables. Therefore, in the present study, it was attempted to compare the performance of bioclimatic variables derived from precipitation and temperature instrumental records (scenario I) and variables derived from remote sensing data (scenario II) where both scenarios were from 2001 to 2017. The variables were employed to predict the distribution of Artemisia sieberi in central Iran through five Species Distribution Models (SDMs) such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). The DEM layer was derived from 90-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 1-km MODIS land surface temperature and vegetation indices products, and downscaled PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data were employed as derivations of temperature and precipitation to produce bioclimatic variables for scenario II. The results obtained from independent sample t-test on AUC(ratio) values derived from the correlative models showed that it had more satisfactory results when they were getting from the data of scenario II than the scenario I (p < .01). RF scored the highest partial AUC values (AUC(ratio)) among the single models, and based on both scenarios, ensemble map was able to provide the most accurate predictions. There were also non-significant differences among the performance of RF, CTA and ensemble models under two scenarios (p < .01). Results emphasized the importance of bioclimatic variables derived from remote sensing to produce more up-to-date information and also to improve the predictive performance of SDMs. Finally, it was suggested that convenient access to reliable and up-to-date information can assist modelers to outline management practices well.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101060,included,NA
Implication Of Geo-Informatics (Gis/Rs) On Agricultural Irrigation Management: The State Of The Art,"The agricultural sector is the highest water consumer worldwide. Its production is the essential pillar in world’s food security. Limited water resources are the major constraint in an agricultural production system. Better application of irrigation water will result in increased water and land productivity for the planted crops. Precision irrigation is one of the promising keys to solve this dilemma. It allows applying the exact needed amount of water in its optimal place at the right time. Yet, this requires a huge information database to be accurately able to apply precision irrigation. The traditional trial-and-error technique in agricultural experiments to improve land and water productivity is time-consuming and sometimes is economically unaffordable. Thus, there is a need to develop more cost-effective and accurate tools to correctly survey world’s natural resources and its most sustainable exploitation. Geo-informatics implication in combination with suitable decision support systems plays a relevant role in water management in agricultural sector, especially when applying precision irrigation and farming techniques. This chapter aims to provide an overview about the implication of geo-informatics (with a special focus on geographic information systems and remote sensing) in irrigation water management on both local level (Egypt) and international level. Although geo-informatics applications for agricultural management have been used since the early 1980s, still there is a place for further research to maximize the benefits of its use.

Using Remote Sensing As A Support To The Implementation Of The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive In Sw Portugal,"The exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of coastal countries are coming under increasing pressure from various economic sectors such as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and energy production. In Europe, there is a policy to expand the maritime economic sector without damaging the environment by ensuring that these activities comply with legally binding Directives, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). However, monitoring an extensive maritime area is a logistical and economic challenge. Remote sensing is considered one of the most cost effective, methods for providing the spatial and temporal environmental data that will be necessary for the effective implementation of the MSFD. However, there is still a concern about the uncertainties associated with remote sensed products. This study has tested how a specific satellite product can contribute to the monitoring of a MSFD Descriptor for ""good environmental status"" (GES). The results show that the quality of the remote sensing product Algal Pigment Index 1 (API 1) from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor of the European Space Agency for ocean colour products can be effectively validated with in situ data from three stations off the SW Iberian Peninsula. The validation results show good agreement between the MERIS API 1 and the in situ data for the two more offshore stations, with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.79, and with lower uncertainties for the average relative percentage difference (RPD) of 24.6\% and 27.9\% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.40 and 0.38 for Stations B and C, respectively. Near to the coast, Station A has the lowest R-2 of 0.63 and the highest uncertainties with an RPD of 112.9\% and a RMSE of 1.00. It is also the station most affected by adjacency effects from the land: when the Improved Contrast between Ocean and Land processor (ICOL) is applied the R-2 increases to 0.77 and there is a 30\% reduction in the uncertainties estimated by RPD. The MERIS API 1 product decreases from inshore to offshore, with higher values occurring mainly between early spring and the end of the summer, and with lower values during winter. By using the satellite images for API 1, it is possible to detect and track the development of algal blooms in coastal and marine waters, demonstrating the usefulness of remote sensing for supporting the implementation of the MSFD with respect to Descriptor 5: Eutrophication. It is probable that remote sensing will also prove to be useful for monitoring other Descriptors of the MSFD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Evaporative Fluxes And Surface Soil Moisture Retrievals In A Mediterranean Setting From Sentinel-3 And The ""Simplified Triangle""","Earth Observation (EO) makes it possible to obtain information on key parameters characterizing interactions among Earth's system components, such as evaporative fraction (EF) and surface soil moisture (SSM). Notably, techniques utilizing EO data of land surface temperature (Ts) and vegetation index (VI) have shown promise in this regard. The present study investigates, for the first time, the accuracy of one such technique, known as the ""simplified triangle"", using Sentinel-3 EO data, acquired for 44 days in 2018 at three savannah FLUXNET sites in Spain. The technique was found to be able to predict both EF and SSM with reasonable accuracy when compared to collocated ground measurements. Comparisons performed for all days together showed relatively low Root Mean square Difference (RMSD) for both EF (0.191) and SSM (0.012 cm(3) cm(-3)) and good correlation coefficients (R) of 0.721 and 0.577, respectively. Both EF and SSM were also largely in agreement with land cover and seasonal variability. The present study comprises the first detailed assessment of the ""simplified triangle"", in this case, using Sentinel-3 data and in a Mediterranean setting.

International efforts are seeking to integrate existing and emerging Earth observation systems into a global network, with enhanced data distribution, models, and decision support tools. Remote sensing is poised to fulfill the increasing need for a synoptic framework. However, the desire to improve the connection between scientific research and societal benefits has not been matched with resources and tools required to bridge the gap between research and applications. Natural hazards research and disaster management are a prime example. Here, we present a conceptual case for how interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data could make a definitive contribution to understanding earthquake processes while simultaneously supporting policy- and decision-making. InSAR measurements derived from time series of radar observations from Earth orbit uniquely can provide geographically comprehensive maps of surface deformation. Observing system simulations are suggested to evaluate the potential contributions of a future system. Simulations would adopt an open seismic hazard analysis (SHA) framework, OpenSHA, recognizing the need for more physics-based modeling and computational infrastructure. SHA is employed by the HAZUS-MH earthquake module to estimate losses. InSAR measurements of strain accumulation would provide event magnitude recurrence bounds for probabilistic SHA, while coseismic InSAR measurements would add constraints on fault rupture models for deterministic approaches. Moreover, interferograms would be incorporated graphically as proxy seismic risk maps for planning and mitigation.",NA,NA,10.1109/tgrs.2007.895848,included,NA
Compliance With European Union Environmental Law: An Analysis Of Digitalization Effects On Institutional Capacities,"This article presents evidence for the positive effects of digitalization on the institutional capacity of key stakeholders, which is a necessary precondition for narrowing the existing implementation gap in European Union environmental law. Based on document analysis and semistructured interviews with actors involved in the implementation process, four main factors are considered. First, the Commission's institutional capacity benefits from a change of focus of the reporting system from textual information to data and indicators and by the development of new data harvesting methods. Second, subnational actors have improved their institutional capacity through knowledge transfers and strategic planning, facilitated by better information and communication technology and statistical data. Third, inspection networks benefitted from technical advances, such as the access to satellite images, presenting new opportunities for the detection of environmental crimes, and new software programs facilitating risk-based inspections. Finally, citizens' and nongovernmental organizations' improved access to data and to justice in environmental matters strengthened their monitoring capacities.",NA,NA,10.1002/eet.1877,included,NA
Geocolor: A Blending Technique For Satellite Imagery,"Value-added imagery is a useful means of communicating multispectral environmental satellite radiometer data to the human analyst. The most effective techniques strike a balance between science and art. The science side requires engineering physical algorithms capable of distilling the complex scene into a reduced set of key parameters. The artistic side involves design and construction of visually intuitive displays that maximize information content within the product image. The utility of such imagery to human analysts depends on the extent to which parameters or features of interest are conveyed unambiguously. Here, we detail and demonstrate a dynamic blended imagery technique, based on spatially variant transparency factors whose values are tied to algorithmically isolated parameters. The technique enables seamless display of multivariate information, and is applicable to any imaging system based on red-green-blue composites. We illustrate this technique in the context of GeoColor-an application of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R (GOES-R) series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) supporting operational forecasting and used widely in public communication of weather information.",NA,NA,10.1175/jtech-d-19-0134.1,included,NA
Exploring The Potential Of Google Earth As A Communication And Engagement Tool In Collaborative Natural Flood Management Planning,"This paper considers the development and evaluation of a Google Earth ""virtual globe"" tour for communicating spatial data and engaging stakeholders in the early stages of a natural flood management (NFM) planning scenario, using a rural UK river catchment that suffered significant flooding in 2007. With a range of diverse stakeholder interests to consider, early engagement and the development of trust before decision-making are essential for the long-term success of such catchment-wide projects. A local catchment group was consulted to identify key information requirements, and from this a ""virtual globe"" tour was created. The process involved specialist skills and expert leadership, but the end result was accessible to a range of audiences. User evaluation indicated that it was easy to navigate and can be used to stimulate interest and engage stakeholders. Participants trusted the content and valued the interactivity of the tour. It was helpful for communicating and educating participants about the catchment, the issues it faces, and the potential to incorporate NFM, particularly for those with little or no prior knowledge. More abstract information was harder to convey and there were limitations in the availability of suitable data for some variables and the in quality of satellite imagery. This exploratory research found that a Google Earth ""virtual globe"" tour can be a valuable tool in the initial stages of an NFM project, but there are also opportunities to use this technique in the more advanced stages of the planning process. The approach could be used as part of a wider toolkit for communication and engagement and has potential as a decision support tool in other environmental management scenarios with requirements for public participation, enabling the views of a range of participants to be captured through online distribution and to generate discussion in workshop settings.",NA,NA,10.1111/geoj.12323,included,NA
Unmanned Aircraft In Nature Conservation: An Example From Plant Invasions,"To successfully fight plant invasions, new methods enabling fast and efficient monitoring are needed, and remote sensing can make their management more efficient and less expensive. However, the data resolution, cost, and availability can be limiting. Optimal solution depends on the species characteristics, where the spectral and spatial resolution can compensate each other to some extent, and phenology plays an important role. Available high spatial resolution satellite data are sufficient for recognition of species that are distinct and either large or form uniform patches at size comparable to the data pixel size. For other species, higher spatial resolution is needed, and unmanned aircraft (UAV) provide data of extremely high spatial resolution (cm) at low cost and high flexibility. We assess its potential to map invasive black locust (BL, Robinia pseudoaccacia), testing imagery of different origin (satellite, UAV), spectral (multispectral, red, green, and blue (RGB) + near-infrared (NIR)) and spatial resolution, and various technical approaches to choose the best strategy for the species monitoring balancing between precision of detection and economic feasibility. Using purposely designed low-cost UAV with tailless fixed wing design for two consumer cameras (RGB and modified NIR) ensures robustness and repeatable field performance while maintaining high aerodynamic efficiency, with resulting mapping capacity over 10 km(2) per day. Several challenges exist in UAV application, such as lower spectral resolution, geometrical and radiometric distortions, and significant amount of data (necessity of automatic processing). In our study, we tested different options of UAV data processing and present comparison of resulting orthomosaic accuracies. For repeated measurements, it is extremely important to ensure spatial co-registration of pixels/objects from different phenological phases. Investment in GPS receiver in the UAV and GPS post-processing eliminated laborious collection of ground control points, while maintaining the co-registration of objects across multiple flights. In our study we provide evidence of benefit of the low cost unmanned system for species monitoring with high classification accuracies of target species from UAV orthomosaic outcompeting WorldView-2 satellite data, and describe methodology that can be used for practical management of invasions.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2016.1275059,included,NA
Biophysical Characterization Of Protected Areas Globally Through Optimized Image Segmentation And Classification,"Protected areas (PAs) need to be assessed systematically according to biodiversity values and threats in order to support decision-making processes. For this, PAs can be characterized according to their species, ecosystems and threats, but such information is often difficult to access and usually not comparable across regions. There are currently over 200,000 PAs in the world, and assessing these systematically according to their ecological values remains a huge challenge. However, linking remote sensing with ecological modelling can help to overcome some limitations of conservation studies, such as the sampling bias of biodiversity inventories. The aim of this paper is to introduce eHabitat+, a habitat modelling service supporting the European Commission's Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, and specifically to discuss a component that systematically stratifies PAs into different habitat functional types based on remote sensing data. eHabitat+ uses an optimized procedure of automatic image segmentation based on several environmental variables to identify the main biophysical gradients in each PA. This allows a systematic production of key indicators on PAs that can be compared globally. Results from a few case studies are illustrated to show the benefits and limitations of this open-source tool.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs8090780,included,NA
Sharing Environmental Data Through Geoss,"Understanding the complexity of earth-system processes is crucial to convey improved information on the environment to decision-makers and the general public. Addressing this need by sharing environmental data is challenging because it requires a common agreed framework that allows easy and seamless integration of data from different sources. In this regard, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) portends major benefits through various sharing mechanisms and by giving access to services that could be linked together to process and generate new understandable knowledge and information. Various United Nations projects could greatly benefit from the GEOSS approach.",NA,NA,10.4018/jagr.2011010101,included,NA
"Earth Observation For Citizen Science Validation, Or Citizen Science For Earth Observation Validation? The Role Of Quality Assurance Of Volunteered Observations","Environmental policy involving citizen science (CS) is of growing interest. In support of this open data stream of information, validation or quality assessment of the CS geo-located data to their appropriate usage for evidence- based policy making needs a flexible and easily adaptable data curation process ensuring transparency. Addressing these needs, this paper describes an approach for automatic quality assurance as proposed by the Citizen OBservatory WEB (COBWEB) FP7 project. This approach is based upon a workflow composition that combines different quality controls, each belonging to seven categories or ""pillars"". Each pillar focuses on a specific dimension in the types of reasoning algorithms for CS data qualification. These pillars attribute values to a range of quality elements belonging to three complementary quality models. Additional data from various sources, such as Earth Observation (EO) data, are often included as part of the inputs of quality controls within the pillars. However, qualified CS data can also contribute to the validation of EO data. Therefore, the question of validation can be considered as ""two sides of the same coin"". Based on an invasive species CS study, concerning Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), the paper discusses the flexibility and usefulness of qualifying CS data, either when using an EO data product for the validation within the quality assurance process, or validating an EO data product that describes the risk of occurrence of the plant. Both validation paths are found to be improved by quality assurance of the CS data. Addressing the reliability of CS open data, issues and limitations of the role of quality assurance for validation, due to the quality of secondary data used within the automatic workflow, are described, e.g., error propagation, paving the route to improvements in the approach.",NA,NA,10.3390/data2040035,included,NA
Pollution Monitoring: Optimal Design Of Inspection - An Economic Analysis Of The Use Of Satellite Information To Deter Oil Pollution,"A cost-benefit analysis defines the optimal monitoring technique to fight against tankers' illegal oil dumping in the sea: aerial inspection of maritime areas is compared with inspection using imperfect but costly satellite information to design aerial inspection, when polluters are fined if observed by a plane. We provide theoretical modeling and show that, at the equilibrium of the game between polluters and the monitoring agency, satellite information can decrease pollution, reduce monitoring costs, or both, depending an the social cost of pollution. We prove that the condition under which combining satellite and aerial observation dissuades more polluters than only relying on aerial monitoring does not depend on satellite information accuracy. A numerical example applies the model to the choice of the optimal monitoring technique over the Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 1999 Academic Press.",NA,NA,10.1006/jeem.1999.1072,included,NA
A Study Of Autonomous Small Satellite Constellations For Disaster Management And Deep Space Strategy,"The complex and dynamic space environment is both exciting and challenging in this NewSpace era. In particular, Low-Earth Orbits are being realigned and reinvented for various purposes using suitable technological advancement. This paper is focused on the major parameters that can be analyzed to attain orbit control and autonomy of small-satellite constellations for real-time applications. By applying industry experience to graduate research, this work addresses the related concerns in a realistic manner. Currently, global small-satellite constellation solutions are too expensive and inaccessible for many nations to help in their data reception requirements. This issue was addressed, and some of the main aspects relating to low-cost and high-benefit technical synthesis, in addition to utilization for deep-space missions, were also discussed in detail. In conclusion, this paper demonstrated a strategic approach to optimize the coverage and performance, and reduce the cost of small-satellite constellations, compared with present day constellations, allowing the data to be relayed faster and with precision. This will benefit the industry in the development of low-cost constellations, and effectively assist in disaster management and deep-space communication relays. Autonomous orbit selection and navigation can be established for better path alignment for satellites to efficiently propagate and deliver the required data.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14236148,included,NA
"When Digital Technology Innovation Enhances Indigenous Peoples' E-Participation In Climate Change Resilience-Building: Perspectives Under The ""E-Gis Smart, Inclusive, And, Climate-Resilient Indigenous Peoples Landscape And Community Clearing-House Mechanism Solution""","Web-based multilingual tools to facilitate communication between Local and Indigenous Communities is an environmental technology approach emerging under the United Nations Biodiversity Global Agenda. To better address present climate resilience-building challenges in the current smart world, this contribution presents innovative avenues leading to the development of the << e-GIS Smart, Inclusive, and, Climate-resilient Indigenous Peoples Landscape and Community Clearing-House Mechanism Solution >> which is meant to be used in the mobile-friendly website environment and the e-app environment. This technology policy paper shows that digital GIS, remote sensing products of observation satellites, and smartphone applications products derived from telecommunication satellites can help facilitate Indigenous Peoples' contribution to climate resilience-building within their territories in terms of biodiversity and within their communities in terms of poverty eradication throughout the implementation of the United Nations Indigenous Peoples' Affairs Global Agenda. The methodology used consists, therefore, of a plural technology interface that promises, among many other benefits, to facilitate Indigenous Peoples' participation in decision-making processes. This research reminds us of the importance of state responsibility in these matters. It shows the importance of Indigenous Peoples' participation in the implementation of global instances' agendas through national reporting. It highlights the key role of Indigenous information decolonization and governance as principles of Indigenous Peoples' sovereignty over Indigenous information. The results of this research are illustrated with case studies, when possible, to show the potential of the Solution to achieve its goals in climate resilience-building in Indigenous Peoples Landscapes and Communities with Indigenous Peoples and the financial support of state governments and inter-governmental institutions.

Operational Evaluation Of A Wildfire Air Quality Model From A Forecaster Point Of View,"An evaluation of an operational wildfire air quality model (WFAQM) has been performed. Evaluation metrics were chosen through an analysis of interviews and a survey of professionals who use WFAQM forecasts as part of their daily responsibilities. The survey revealed that professional users generally focus on whether forecast air quality will exceed thresholds that trigger local air quality advisories (e.g., an event), their analysis scale is their region of responsibility, they are interested in short-term (approximate to 24 h) guidance, missing an event is worse than issuing a false alarm, and there are two types of users-one that takes the forecast at face value, and the other that uses it as one of several information sources. Guided by these findings, model performance of Environment and Climate Change Canada's current operational WFAQM (FireWork) was assessed over western Canada during three (2016-18) summer (May-September) wildfire seasons. Evaluation was performed at the geographic scale at which individual forecasts are issued (the forecast region) using gridded particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) fields developed from a machine learning-based downscaling of satellite and meteorological data. For the ""at face value"" user group, model performance was measured using the Peirce skill score. For the ""as information source"" user group, model performance was measured using the divergence skill score. For this metric, forecasts were first converted to event probabilities using binomial regression. We find when forecasts are taken at face value, FireWork cannot outperform a nearest-neighbor-based persistence model. However, when forecasts are considered as an information source, FireWork is superior to the persistence-based model.",NA,NA,10.1175/waf-d-21-0064.1,included,NA
Mapping Open Data And Big Data To Address Climate Resilience Of Urban Informal Settlements In Sub-Saharan Africa,"This perspective paper highlights the potentials, limitations, and combinations of openly available Earth observation (EO) data and big data in the context of environmental research in urban areas. The aim is to build the resilience of informal settlements to climate change impacts. In particular, it highlights the types, categories, spatial and temporal scales of publicly available big data. The benefits of publicly available big data become clear when looking at issues such as the development and quality of life in informal settlements within and around major African cities. Sub-Saharan African (SSA) cities are among the fastest growing urban areas in the world. However, they lack spatial information to guide urban planning towards climate-adapted cities and fair living conditions for disadvantaged residents who mostly reside in informal settlements. Therefore, this study collected key information on freely available data such as data on land cover, land use, and environmental hazards and pressures, demographic and socio-economic indicators for urban areas. They serve as a vital resource for success of many other related local studies, such as the transdisciplinary research project ""DREAMS-Developing REsilient African cities and their urban environMent facing the provision of essential urban SDGs"". In the era of exponential growth of big data analytics, especially geospatial data, their utility in SSA is hampered by the disparate nature of these datasets due to the lack of a comprehensive overview of where and how to access them. This paper aims to provide transparency in this regard as well as a resource to access such datasets. Although the limitations of such big data are also discussed, their usefulness in assessing environmental hazards and human exposure, especially to climate change impacts, are emphasised.",NA,NA,10.3390/cli10120186,included,NA
Precision Farming: Technologies And Information As Risk-Reduction Tools,"Precision farming (PF) or site-specific fanning (SSF) is a relatively new concept in the management of production agriculture. Rooted in ""management"", PF brings the information age and space-age technology together with the science of producing food and fiber. In this process, there exists an increased opportunity to reduce environmental risks from pesticide use with improved environmental stewardship and greater economic profitability via more efficient use of scarce resources. PF thus is an example of combining newer techniques of satellites, remote sensing and computers with the familiar tools of soil testing, scouting and yield analyses. Information can help farmers reduce pesticide use, lower the need for insurance sprays, cut input costs and bring added environmental and economic soundness to the forefront. In order to exploit the potential for PF in accurately locating spatially variable pest/weed populations, a system of selectively applying cpas' (N, etc) is thus required. Development of ""patch"" sprayers, which are connected to computer-linked mapping, could allow treatment to patches within the field. Requirements for information acquisition, analysis strategy development, delivery and evaluation of results can be very intensive depending upon the state of knowledge about the soil, N needs, as well as pest identification and development profiles There remain serious questions about information ownership and economic benefits to all farmers. The various levels of information have to be well integrated in order to achieve an understanding about crop health and pest abundance/damage interactions, pest aggressiveness and invasion capacity, needed for a sustainable agriculture.",NA,NA,10.1021/bk-1999-0734.ch008,included,NA
Satellite-Based Et Mapping To Assess Variation In Et With Timing Of Crop Development,"Evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated agriculture is an important issue in and and semiarid regions where it has large impact on water resources depletion and water management. Satellite-based remote sensing is a robust, economic and efficient tool for estimating actual ET from irrigated regions and for developing crop coefficient (K-c) curves. The technique can cover hundreds of sampled fields at a time so that large populations of ET and K, can be used to develop representative mean values. This paper uses a satellite remote sensing technique to analyse the impact of planting and development schedules of crops on ET for crops of dry beans, corn, potatoes, sugar beets and small grains (wheat and barley), which are major crops in the temperate, semiarid climate of southern Idaho. The results indicate that early planted and developing crops consume 6-10\% more water in the southern Idaho environment than late developing crops for most major crop types. This increase occurs primarily because early developing crops tend to have a relatively longer growing period than crops developing later in spring. ET quantified through this procedure may have application in evaluating irrigation/project performance and in determining economic productivity of water. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Examining The Value Of Satellite Data In Halting Transmission Of Polio In Nigeria: A Socioeconomic Analysis,"In 2014, Nigeria halted transmission of wild poliovirus for the first time in its history. A critical enabling component in this historic achievement was the use of satellite data to produce more accurate maps and population estimates used in planning and implementing vaccination campaigns. This article employs a value-of-information approach to estimate the net socioeconomic benefits associated with this use of satellite data. We calculate the increase in the likelihood of halting transmission of polio associated with the use of satellite-based information compared to traditional data sources, and we consider the benefits associated with savings to the healthcare system as well as health benefits. Using a conservative approach focused on just 1 year of benefits, we estimate net socioeconomic benefits of between \$46.0 million and \$153.9 million. In addition to these quantified benefits, we also recognize qualitative benefits associated with improving human health, reaching marginalized communities, and building capacity among local populations. We also explore the substantial benefits associated with follow-on projects that have made use of the satellite-based data products and methodologies originally developed for the Nigeria polio eradication effort.",NA,NA,10.1017/dap.2023.12,included,NA
Remote Sensing And Site-Specific Weed Management,"Weeds typically occur in patches rather than uniformly across a field; however, conventional management practices rely on whole-field management. Site-specific weed management (SSWM), applying control measures only where weeds are located at densities greater than those that cause economic losses, has tremendous potential for economic and environmental benefits. Current commercially available systems can detect green vegetation and activate a herbicide spray nozzle. Researchers are actively exploring how ground-based, aerial, or satellite sensor systems can be further developed to delineate weeds from crops during the growing season. Aerial and satellite systems can provide large-area coverage on a regular basis, but typically do not have the spatial resolution necessary to detect small weeds among agricultural crops, which is necessary if effective control and minimized crop yield losses are to be achieved. Ground-based systems overcome spatial resolution issues and can analyze plant shape characteristics as well as spectral profiles for weed detection. The primary limitation for ground-based sensors is the highly complex computational capabilities and the relatively slow speeds required to allow image processing and sprayer activation in a single operation. To date, economic and technical limitations for SSWM have not favored widespread adoption. However, as research continues and technology advances, the opportunities for site-specific control of weeds will greatly increase.",NA,NA,10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0526:rsaswm]2.0.co;2,included,NA
Crossing The (Watershed) Divide: Satellite Data And The Changing Politics Of International River Basins,"Acquiring freshwater resources is a necessary component of sustainable human settlement subject to increasing pressure from population and climate changes. This sometimes scarce resource primarily comes from rivers, and international river basins (IRBs), where watersheds and watercourses cross political boundaries, are often spaces of great political tension and conflict worldwide. Such conflict potential has garnered interest from a wide range of research communities, and each emphasises public access to hydrologic data as integral to successful international management of IRBs. However; these hydrologic data, especially measurements of river flow rate, are often closely guarded state secrets. Satellites have been cited as a key technology set to challenge this data monopoly that have yet been unable to calculate river flow rate without some form of guarded ancillary data. Now, at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) offers a means of circumventing data limitations without any a priori information, and the forthcoming NASA/CNES Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite also promises to estimate flow rates solely from its novel measurements following launch. In this paper, we explore how these newly available estimates of river flow rate could reconfigure water-management and interstate relations in IRBs, and demonstrate AMHG, for two cases: the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong. For these basins we find that satellite flow rate retrievals will likely reinforce and favour state-level negotiations of water resource governance. Also, satellite flow retrievals can have the direct, concrete effect of improving hydrologic understanding of the upstream Ganges-Brahmaputra, a sorely needed advance that will positively benefit millions of Bangladeshis and affect state-level interactions between India, China, and Bangladesh. Finally, we avoid offering prescriptive water management solutions for each case, as local stakeholders will ultimately determine if and how such satellite retrievals will be used.",NA,NA,10.1111/geoj.12155,included,NA
System Modelling Of Very Low Earth Orbit Satellites For Earth Observation,"The operation of satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO) has been linked to a variety of benefits to both the spacecraft platform and mission design. Critically, for Earth observation (EO) missions a reduction in altitude on can enable smaller and less powerful payloads to achieve the same performance as larger instruments or sensors at higher altitude, with significant benefits to the spacecraft design. As a result, renewed interest in the exploitation of these orbits has spurred the development of new technologies that have the potential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude range. In this paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve aerodynamic performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and resistance to atomic oxygen erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) for sustained drag compensation or mitigation in VLEO. Attitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic forces and torques in VLEO are also discussed. These system models are integrated into a framework for concept-level satellite design and this approach is used to explore the system-level trade-offs for future EO spacecraft enabled by these new technologies. A case-study presented for an optical very-high resolution spacecraft demonstrates the significant potential of reducing orbital altitude using these technologies and indicates possible savings of up to 75\% in system mass and over 50\% in development and manufacturing costs in comparison to current state-of-the-art missions. For a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, the reduction in mass and cost with altitude were shown to be smaller, though it was noted that currently available cost models do not capture recent commercial advancements in this segment. These results account for the additional propulsive and power requirements needed to sustain operations in VLEO and indicate that future EO missions could benefit significantly by operating in this altitude range. Furthermore, it is shown that only modest advancements in technologies already under development may begin to enable exploitation of this lower altitude range. In addition to the upstream benefits of reduced capital expense and a faster return on investment, lower costs and increased access to high quality observational data may also be passed to the downstream EO industry, with impact across a wide range of commercial, societal, and environmental application areas.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.07.004,included,NA
In-Season Prediction Of Corn Grain Yield Through Planetscope And Sentinel-2 Images,"Crop growth and yield monitoring are essential for food security and agricultural economic return prediction. Remote sensing is an efficient technique for measuring growing season crop canopies and providing information on the spatial variability of crop yields. In this study, ten vegetation indices (VIs) derived from time series PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images were used to investigate the potential to estimate corn grain yield with different regression methods. A field-scale spatial crop yield prediction model was developed and used to produce yield maps depicting spatial variability in the field. Results from this study clearly showed that high-resolution PlanetScope satellite data could be used to detect the corn yield variability at field level, which could explain 15\% more variability than Sentinel-2A data at the same spatial resolution of 10 m. Comparison of the model performance and variable importance measure between models illustrated satisfactory results for assessing corn productivity with VIs. The green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) values consistently produced the highest correlations with corn yield, accounting for 72\% of the observed spatial variation in corn yield. More reliable quantitative yield estimation could be made using a multi-linear stepwise regression (MSR) method with multiple VIs. Good agreement between observed and predicted yield was achieved with the coefficient of determination value being 0.81 at 86 days after seeding. The results would help farmers and decision-makers generate predicted yield maps, identify crop yield variability, and make further crop management practices timely.",NA,NA,10.3390/agronomy12123176,included,NA
Use Of Google Earth™ To Strengthen Public Health Capacity And Facilitate Management Of Vector-Borne Diseases In Resource-Poor Environments,"Objective: Novel, inexpensive solutions are needed for improved management of vector-borne and other diseases in resource-poor environments. Emerging free software providing access to satellite imagery and simple editing tools (e.g. Google Earth™) complement existing geographic information system (GIS) software and provide new opportunities for: (i) strengthening overall public health capacity through development of information for city infrastructures; and (ii) display of public health data directly on an image of the physical environment. Methods: We used freely accessible satellite imagery and a set of feature-making tools included in the software (allowing for production of polygons, lines and points) to generate information for city infrastructure and to display disease data in a dengue decision support system (DDSS) framework. Findings: Two cities in Mexico (Chetumal and Merida) were used to demonstrate that a basic representation of city infrastructure useful as a spatial backbone in a DDSS can be rapidly developed at minimal cost. Data layers generated included labelled polygons representing city blocks, lines representing streets, and points showing the locations of schools and health clinics. City blocks were colour-coded to show presence of dengue cases. The data layers were successfully imported in a format known as shapefile into a GIS software. Conclusion: The combination of Google Earth™ and free GIS software (e.g. HealthMapper, developed by WHO, and SIGEpi, developed by PAHO) has tremendous potential to strengthen overall public health capacity and facilitate decision support system approaches to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.",NA,NA,10.2471/blt.07.045880,included,NA
Crowdsourcing To Enhance Insights From Satellite Observations,"Insights from satellite observations are increasingly being used to enhance a range of domains from highly specialised scientific research through to everyday applications directly benefiting members of the public. A particular category of satellite observations-Earth Observations (EO)-is concerned with capturing information regarding the Earth's atmospheric and environmental conditions and observing human activity and its impact on the Earth's surface. A growing number of technologies and services heavily rely on EO data and the rapidly improving fidelity, coverage, timeliness and accessibility of such observations are providing significant opportunities for new applications of economic and societal benefit. With the increasing importance, relevance and size of EO data sets, it is critical to understand how the value of such data can be maximised by complementing EO with other sources of data and efficiently making complex interpretations and decisions. The wide adoption and availability of smartphones, Internet devices and increased accessibility to information has paved the way for large numbers of citizens and communities to participate in scientific, technological, societal and decision-making activities. This chapter discusses the experience of the European Space Agency funded Crowd4Sat project led by the University of Sheffield that investigated different facets of how crowdsourcing and citizen science impact upon the validation, use and enhancement of Observations from Satellites products and services.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-3-319-70878-2\_2,included,NA
The Utility Of Infrequent Snow Depth Images For Deriving Continuous Space-Time Estimates Of Seasonal Snow Water Equivalent,"Snow water equivalent (SWE), particularly in mountains regions, has been an elusive hydrologic measurement. We examine the utility of a data assimilation approach to generate space-time continuous estimates of SWE from more readily available snow depth (SD) measurements. A multitemporal lidar data set provides a unique opportunity to assimilate single SD images and verify posterior estimates against SD images at nonassimilation times. Application over three water years shows significant improvement in the posterior estimates with an average correlation between estimated and measured SD fields of 0.88 compared to 0.52 for prior estimates that do not benefit from the assimilated SD data. We also show that posterior estimates are consistent with independent in situ SWE and streamflow measurements. This work demonstrates that using high-resolution/high-accuracy, but infrequent, SD measurements combined with a data assimilation framework could make significant inroads toward the goal of spatially distributed SWE and snowmelt estimates at the global scale. Plain Language Summery The mass of water stored in seasonal snowpacks (snow water equivalent) is a key parameter for water supply management. Yet, despite its importance and decades of effort, snow water equivalent has been an elusive variable to characterize over the mountainous areas of the globe, with no existing satellite capable of providing routine estimates of these important water stores. We propose a new approach using so-called data assimilation techniques to transform infrequently available measurements of snow depth to continuous estimates of snow water equivalent and snowmelt rates. We show that even a single snow depth measurement near the time of peak snow accumulation can result in accurate estimation of the evolution of snow water equivalent and snowmelt rates across the water year. Our results suggest a potential new pathway for the hydrologic community in its long-pursued goal of global-scale estimates (from satellite remote sensing) of snow water equivalent and its space-time variability. If applied at large scales with satellite-derived snow depth measurements, such methods could have significant implications for improved water resource and hazard management.",NA,NA,10.1029/2019gl082507,included,NA
The Role Of Satellite Technologies In Relief Logistics,"Purpose - The devastating impact of catastrophic disasters on terrestrial infrastructure requires the adoption of alternative technology solutions among humanitarian organizations.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines both the benefits and limitations of satellite technologies in light of the existing literature and through a complementary questionnaire survey with field workers involved in humanitarian operations in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Findings - The results show that the use of satellite technologies can facilitate most of the key logistics challenges encountered by relief actors. However, they also highlight important barriers within humanitarian organizations such as the lack of skilled workers and high costs, underlining the need for long- term training, resource investments, and cooperation between users and technology providers. Research limitations/implications - The research findings remain valid only in the context of catastrophic disaster responses, which lead to similar destructions, logistical problems, and needs for satellite technologies. Practical implications - This paper shows how satellite technologies can support humanitarian professionals in the field. It also provides policy recommendations that can facilitate the use of these technologies. Originality/value - The applications of satellite technologies within humanitarian supply chains are not well- defined in the literature. This paper is the first to be dedicated to analyze the role of the main satellite technologies used in a relief logistics setting.",NA,NA,10.1108/jhlscm-07-2016-0031,included,NA
Identification Of Agricultural Management Zones Through Clustering Algorithms With Thermal And Multispectral Satellite Imagery,"Precision Agriculture entails the appropriate management of the inherent variability of soil and crops, resulting in an increase of economic benefits and a reduction of environmental impact. However, site-specific treatments require maps of the soil variability to identify areas of land that share similar properties. In order to produce these maps, we propose a cost-efficient method that combines clustering algorithms with publicly available satellite imagery. The method does not require exploring the parcels with any special equipment or taking samples of the soil for laboratory analysis. The proposed method was tested in a case study for three vineyard parcels with topographical dissimilarities. The study compares different spectral and thermal bands from the Landsat 8 satellite as well as vegetation and moisture indices to determine which one produces the best clustering. The experimental results seem promising for identification of agricultural management zones. The findings suggest that thermal bands produce better clustering than those based on the NDVI index.",NA,NA,10.1142/s0218488517400062,included,NA
Ocean Colour Opportunities From Meteosat Second And Third Generation Geostationary Platforms,"Ocean colour applications from medium-resolution polar-orbiting satellite sensors have now matured and evolved into operational services. These applications are enabled by the Sentinel-3 OLCI space sensors of the European Earth Observation Copernicus programme and the VIIRS sensors of the US Joint Polar Satellite System programme. Key drivers for the Copernicus ocean colour services are the national obligations of the EU member states to report on the quality of marine, coastal and inland waters for the EU Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Further applications include CO2 sequestration, carbon cycle and climate, fisheries and aquaculture management, near-real-time alerting to harmful algae blooms, environmental monitoring and forecasting, and assessment of sediment transport in coastal waters. Ocean colour data from polar-orbiting satellite platforms, however, suffer from fractional coverage, primarily due to clouds, and inadequate resolution of quickly varying processes. Ocean colour remote sensing from geostationary platforms can provide significant improvements in coverage and sampling frequency and support new applications and services. EUMETSAT's SEVIRI instrument on the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation platforms (MSG) is not designed to meet ocean colour mission requirements, however, it has been demonstrated to provide valuable contribution, particularly in combination with dedicated ocean colour polar observations. This paper describes the ongoing effort to develop operational ocean colour water turbidity and related products and user services from SEVIRI. SEVIRI's multi-temporal capabilities can benefit users requiring improved local-area coverage and frequent diurnal observations. A survey of user requirements and a study of technical capabilities and limitations of the SEVIRI instruments are the basis for this development and are described in this paper. The products will support monitoring of sediment transport, water clarity, and tidal dynamics by providing hourly coverage and long-term time series of the diurnal observations. Further products and services are anticipated from EUMETSAT's FCI instruments on Meteosat Third Generation satellites (MTG), including potential chlorophyll a products.",NA,NA,10.5194/os-12-703-2016,included,NA

"Testing The Water Balance Model Criteria Using Tdr Measurements, Micrometeorological Data And Satellite-Based Information","Aiming at developing real time water balance modelling for irrigation scheduling, this study assesses the accuracy of the soil water balance model CRITERIA, developed by the hydro-meteorological service of the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). The model consists of (i) an algorithm for coupling the surface flow components (i.e. Richards equation), and (ii) various Modules which may be applicable to different topographical and environmental conditions. In this study, CRITERIA was applied to simulate the soil water balance for an orange orchard in semi-arid Mediterranean conditions (Eastern Sicily, insular Italy) during the cropping season 2011. The model was implemented by varying the evapotranspiration rates (ET) as input; ET fluxes were estimated by using satellite-based approach and the Penman-Monteith expression for reference rates, or were directly measured by the eddy covariance technique and the sap flow heat pulse Method for transpiration. Model outputs, in term of soil moisture, were validated with direct measures of volumetric soil water content obtained by time domain reflectrometry (TDR) probes. Results of the study proved the reliability of CRITERIA to reproduce the soil moisture profile at the experimental site. The model performance was significantly high when direct measurements of crop water demand were included as input for model application. The satellite-based approach provided reliable crop evapotranspiration estimates, confirming the utility of the remote sensing techniques as support for water management in agriculture.

Characterization Of Field-Scale Soil Variation Using A Stepwise Multi-Sensor Fusion Approach And A Cost-Benefit Analysis,"The potential of a stepwise fusion of proximally sensed portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectra and electromagnetic induction (EMI) with remote Sentinel-2 bands and a digital elevation model (DEM) was investigated for predicting soil physicochemical properties in pedons and across a heterogeneous 80-ha crop field in Wisconsin, USA. We found that pXRF spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models can predict sand, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), silt contents, and clay with validation R-2 of 0.81, 0.74, 0.73, 0.68, and 0.64 at the pedon scale but performed less well for soil pH (R-2 = 0.51). A combination of EMI, Sentinel-2, and DEM data showed promise in mapping sand, silt contents, and TN at two depths and Ap horizon thickness and soil depth across the field. A clustering analysis using combinations of mapped soil properties or proximal and remote sensing data suggested that data fusion improved the characterization of field-scale variability of soil properties. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the most accurate management zones (MZs) for topsoil can be generated only using estimated soil property maps while it was the most costly as compared to other data sources. For an intermediate-high (for topsoil) and high (subsoil) accuracy and a moderate economic budget, the combination of sensors (proximal + remote sensing + DEM) might be a better approach for effective MZs generation than collecting soil samples for laboratory analysis while the latter produced the most accurate maps for topsoil. It can be concluded that pXRF spectra can be useful for predicting key soil properties (e.g., sand, TN, OC, silt, clay) at different soil depths, and a combination of proximal and remote sensing provides an effective way to delineate soil MZs that are useful for decision-making.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.catena.2021.105190,included,NA
"A Call For An Aloft Air Quality Monitoring Network: Need, Feasibility, And Potential Value","Changing precursor emission patterns in conjunction with stringent health protective air quality standards necessitate accurate quantification of nonlocal contributions to ozone pollution at a location due to atmospheric transport, that by nature predominantly occurs aloft nocturnally. Concerted efforts to characterize ozone aloft on a continuous basis to quantify its contribution to ground-level concentrations, however, are lacking. By applying our classical understanding of air pollution dynamics to analyze variations in widespread surface-level ozone measurements, in conjunction with process-based interpretation from a comprehensive air pollution modeling system and detailed backward-sensitivity calculations that quantitatively link surface-level and aloft pollution, we show that accurate quantification of the amount of ozone in the air entrained from aloft every morning as the atmospheric boundary layer grows is the key missing component for characterizing background pollution at a location, and we propose a cost-effective continuous aloft ozone measurement strategy to address critical scientific gaps in current air quality management. Continuous aloft air pollution measurements can be achieved cost-effectively through leveraging advances in sensor technology and proliferation of tall telecommunications masts. Resultant improvements in ozone distribution characterization at 400-500 m altitude are estimated to be 3-4 times more effective in characterizing the surface-level daily maximum 8-h average ozone (DM8O(3)) than improvements from surface measurements since they directly quantify the amount of pollution imported to a location and furnish key missing information on processes and sources regulating background ozone and its modulation of ground-level concentrations. Since >80\% of the DM8O(3) sensitivity to tropospheric ozone is potentially captured through measurements between 200 and 1200 m altitude (a possible design goal for future remote sensing instrumentation), their assimilation will dramatically improve air quality forecast and health advisories.",NA,NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b02496,included,NA
More Than Counting Pixels - Perspectives On The Importance Of Remote Sensing Training In Ecology And Conservation,"As remote sensing (RS) applications and resources continue to expand, their importance for ecology and conservation increases - and so does the need for effective and successful training of professionals working in those fields. Methodological and applied courses often form part of university curricula, but their practical and long-term benefits only become clear afterwards. Having recently received such training in an interdisciplinary master's programme, we provide our perspectives on our shared education. Through an online survey we include experiences of students and professionals in different fields. Most participants perceive their RS education as useful for their career, but express a need for more training at university level. Hands-on projects are considered the most effective learning method. Besides methodological knowledge, soft skills are clear gains, including problem solving, self-learning and finding individual solutions, and the ability to work in interdisciplinary teams. The largest identified gaps in current RS training concern the application regarding policy making, methodology and conservation. To successfully prepare students for a career, study programmes need to provide RS courses based on state-of-the-art methods, including programming, and interdisciplinary projects linking research and practice supported by a sound technical background.",NA,NA,10.1002/rse2.27,included,NA
Development Of A Multi-Spatial Resolution Approach To The Surveillance Of Active Fire Lines Using Himawari-8,"Satellite remote sensing is regularly used for wildfire detection, fire severity mapping and burnt area mapping. Applications in the surveillance of wildfire using geostationary-based sensors have been limited by low spatial resolutions. With the launch in 2015 of the AHI (Advanced Himawari Imaginer) sensor on board Himawari-8, ten-minute interval imagery is available covering an entire earth hemisphere across East Asia and Australasia. Existing active fire detection algorithms depend on middle infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) channels to detect fire. Even though sub-pixel fire detection algorithms can detect much smaller fires, the location of the fire within the AHI 2 x 2 km (400 ha) MIR/TIR pixel is unknown. This limits the application of AHI as a wildfire surveillance and tracking sensor. A new multi-spatial resolution approach is presented in this paper that utilizes the available medium resolution channels in AHI. The proposed algorithm is able to map firelines at a 500 m resolution. This is achieved using near infrared (NIR) (1 km) and RED (500 m) data to detect burnt area and smoke within the flagged MIR (2 km) pixel. Initial results based on three case studies carried out in Western Australia shows that the algorithm was able to continuously track fires during the day at 500 m resolution. The results also demonstrate the utility for wildfire management activities.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs8110932,included,NA
Optimizing Observing Systems Using Aspen: An Analysis Tool To Assess The Benefit And Cost Effectiveness Of Observations To Earth System Applications,"The Advanced Systems Performance Evaluation tool for NOAA (ASPEN) is developed to help support designing and evaluating existing and planned observing systems in terms of comparative assessment, trade-offs analysis, and design optimization studies. ASPEN is a dynamic tool that rapidly assesses the benefit and cost effectiveness of environmental data obtained from any set of observing systems, whether ground-based or space-based, whether an individual sensor or a collection of sensors. The ASPEN assessed cost effectiveness accounts for the level of ability to measure the environment, the cost(s) associated with acquiring these measurements, and the degree of usefulness of these measurements to users and applications. It computes both the use benefit, measured as a requirements-satisfaction metric, and the cost effectiveness (equal to the benefit-to-cost ratio). ASPEN provides a uniform interface to compare the performance of different observing systems and to capture the requirements and priorities of applications. This interface describes the environment in terms of geophysical observables and their attributes. A prototype implementation of ASPEN is described and demonstrated in this study to assess the benefits of several observing systems for a range of applications. ASPEN could be extended to other types of studies, such as assessing the cost effectiveness of commercial data to applications in all the NOAA mission service areas, and ultimately to societal application areas, and thereby become a valuable addition to the observing systems assessment toolbox.",NA,NA,10.1175/bams-d-22-0004.1,included,NA
Remote Sensing Applications For Precision Agriculture: A Learning Community Approach,"Farmers throughout the world are constantly searching for ways to maximize their returns. Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) may provide technologies needed for farmers to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of precision fanning. However, most farmers do not have the skills to utilize these technologies effectively. Through a learning community approach led by the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium (UMAC), information was shared among scientists, agricultural producers, and data providers. Farmers and ranchers received value-added information derived from AVHRR, MODIS, ETM+, IKONOS, Digit Inc's DALSA camera system and Positive Systems' ADAR 5500 digital aerial camera, over four growing seasons. Emphasis has been placed on reducing the time between data acquisition and delivery of value-added products to farmers, developing practical uses for the data and providing basic training so that the end users could understand how to interpret the information. Farmers and ranchers in rural areas were connected via wide-bandwidth satellite link to a central distribution center at the University of North Dakota. The farmers participated actively in evaluating the usefulness of inputs derived from remotely sensed data, sometimes even by conducting experiments on fertilizer and fungicide applications and assessing the economic benefits. Resulting applications included management zone delineation, verifying the effectiveness of variable-rate fertilizer applications, verifying the effectiveness of fungicide applications, quantifying the loss due to accidental spray drift damage, selecting acres within sugar beet fields under the Payment in Kind program, and monitoring physical damage due to insect, inundation, wind and bail. Several other in-field, early season management practices were also reviewed using high-resolution images. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rse.2003.04.007,included,NA
Remote Sensing For Ecosystem Services And Urban Sustainability,"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how geospatial technologies, especially remote sensing, can play a leading role in defining urban sustainability based on the evaluation of demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). A brief review of sustainable development and urban sustainability will be given followed by demonstrations of the need for green spaces in cities, and the consequences of fragmentation of green spaces on biodiversity. Although there are no substantive figures for desirable levels of green spaces in urban areas for the benefit of inhabitants, the paper proposes minimum desirable areal percentages. The paper defines natural capital and ES and the procedures adopted by researchers in balancing the supply and demand for ES for urban areas. The genuine progress indicator is presented as a measure of assessing human welfare, but it is not pursued as an indicator of sustainability. Examples of the applications of remote sensing technologies for determining supply and demand of ES are reviewed as are the potential of the supply and demand of ES to support decision-making in urban areas, to ensure that development decisions are sustainable and are in the best interests of the urban residents who depend on ES for their life support.",NA,NA,10.14358/pers.87.3.189,included,NA
"Use Of Social Networks For Outreach, Education And Training On Space Applications: Know-How And Experience Of Planete Sciences Midi-Pyrenees And Cnes","Using space technologies and activities for outreach activities, education and training purposes have been developed in France since the creation of CNES in 1962, with one main partner: Planete Sciences. Beyond the development of technological activities and projects (experimental rockets, satellites, and stratospheric balloons), the increasing interest for space applications and services in the daily life (GMES and environment, Galileo, Climate Change, etc.) adds a new dimension to outreach activities. In this context, the social networks have become essential components of the communication on Internet. Acknowledging that the development of social media is a disruption in communication, CNES and Planete Sciences Midi-Pyrenees have integrated these tools in their outreach strategy and experiment what can be done in the space sector with these new tools and evaluate their potential benefits and specific role: blogs and social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) can be considered as a ""market place"", in order to target a new audience, in particular young people. Focusing on earth observation and attractive education tools, Planete Sciences Midi-Pyrenees created the blog ""Un autre regard sur la Terre"" in 2010. CNES included the social networks in its communication strategy since 2008. 4 years of experience allow a first evaluation of the results and the impact. The two complementary approaches show that social media provides a very powerful support for communication and outreach activities during the major space events but can also enable in-depth and educative activities. The powerful dimension of the image is a very strong factor. One main challenge is to go beyond the event itself and to disseminate background messages or in-depth information, with the objective to transform the initial interest raised by social media in a long lasting curiosity or in an involvement in other type of activities, including the practice of hands-on activities by teachers in the classroom. Additional issues and risks related to the use of social media have been identified. - The fact that a longer experience is needed in order to perform a more comprehensive evaluation. - The issue of the ""reaction speed"" and the control of the value of the information by professional organisations. - The issues raised by the use of social networks by employees. - The management of the e-reputation. A last recommendation is related to the resources and manpower needed to animate, drive and develop an online community and manage the social media. This activity requires also a very good knowledge of space activities and shall involve skilled people and experts. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Overview And Applications Of The New York State Mesonet Profiler Network,"Vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, moisture, wind, and aerosols are essential information for weather monitoring and prediction. Their availability, however, is limited in space and time because of the significant resources required to observe them. To fill this gap, the New York State Mesonet (NYSM) Profiler Network has been deployed as a national testbed to facilitate the research, development, and evaluation of ground-based profiling technologies and applications. The testbed comprises 17 profiler stations across the state, forming a long-term regional observational network. Each profiler station comprises a ground-based Doppler lidar, a microwave radiometer (MWR), and an environmental Sky Imager-Radiometer (eSIR). Thermodynamic profiles (temperature and humidity) from the MWR, wind and aerosol profiles from the Doppler lidar, and solar radiance and optical depth parameters from the eSIR are collected, processed, disseminated, and archived every 10 min. This paper introduces the NYSM Profiler Network and reviews the network design and siting, instrumentation, network operations and maintenance, data and products, and some example applications that highlight the benefits of the network. Some sample applications include improved situational awareness and monitoring of the sea-land breeze, long-range wildfire smoke transport, air quality (PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth) and boundary layer height. Ground-based profiling systems promise a path forward for filling a critical gap in the U.S. observing system with the potential to improve analysis and prediction for many weather-sensitive sectors, such as aviation, ground transportation, health, and wind energy.Significance StatementThe New York State Mesonet (NYSM) Profiler Network enables routine measurement of aboveground weather data and products to monitor weather and air quality across the state at high resolutions. The NYSM Profiler Network provides real-time vertical profile information to users across the emergency management, aviation, utility, and public health sectors, including NOAA and NASA, for operations and research, filling a critical gap in monitoring the low-level atmosphere. These data have been used to improve situational awareness and monitor boundary layer dynamics, sea-land breeze development, precipitation type, and air quality. Most important, the NYSM Profiler Network provides a national testbed for the creation and evaluation of new ground-based profiling instrumentation and products.",NA,NA,10.1175/jamc-d-21-0104.1,included,NA

Viirs Nighttime Light Data For Income Estimation At Local Level,"The aim of the paper is to develop a model for the real-time estimation of local level income data by combining machine learning, Earth Observation, and Geographic Information System. More exactly, we estimated the income per capita by help of a machine learning model for 46 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, based on the National Polar-orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime satellite images from 2012-2018. For the automation of calculation, a new ModelBuilder type tool was developed within the ArcGIS software called EO-Incity (Earth Observation-Income city). The sum of light (SOL) data extracted by means of the EO-Incity tool and the observed income data were integrated in an algorithm within the MATLAB software in order to calculate a transfer equation and the average error. The results achieved were subsequently reintegrated in EO-Incity and used for the estimation of the income value at local level. The regression analyses highlighted a stable and strong relationship between SOL and income for the analyzed cities. The EO-Incity tool and the machine learning model proved to be efficient in the real-time estimation of the income at local level. When integrated in the information systems specific for smart cities, they can serve as a support for decision-making in order to fight poverty and reduce social inequalities.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs12182950,included,NA
Estimation Of Surface Soil Moisture With Downscaled Land Surface Temperatures Using A Data Fusion Approach For Heterogeneous Agricultural Land,"Field-scale surface soil moisture (SSM, 0–10 cm), which is closely linked with land surface temperature (LST), is particularly important to agricultural water resource management. Active and passive microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrievals on the order of kilometer squared resolutions are difficult to apply to heterogeneous agricultural land surfaces that may need SSM data at a resolution of 30 m. In this study, the High-resolution Urban Thermal Sharpener and Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model were applied to downscale optical and thermal remote sensing data simultaneously by blending Landsat and MODIS red-near infrared-LST data, with the ultimate goal to generate field-scale SSM values from the trapezoidal approach. To evaluate the performance of the downscaled LST E (based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model method) and SSM, an irrigation district (Area 1) in Inner Mongolia and an irrigation district in the North China Plain (Area 2) with varying spatial heterogeneity were selected as the testbeds. Results indicated that the downscaled LST E was highly consistent with synchronous Landsat LST H and in situ LST measurements in Area 1, with the root-mean-square error ranging from 0.73 to 2.75 K. Compared with the MODIS SSM, the average root-mean-square error of the downscaled SSM improved from 0.048 to 0.038 cm 3 /cm 3 for both areas. The downscaled LST E and SSM developed in this study enhance the spatiotemporal resolutions of the SSM estimates, maximizing the potential of remotely sensed information for agricultural water resource management. ©2019.

"Gap-Free Monitoring Of Annual Mangrove Forest Dynamics In Ca Mau Province, Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Using The Landsat-7-8 Archives And Post-Classification Temporal Optimization","Ecosystem services offered by mangrove forests are facing severe risks, particularly through land use change driven by human development. Remote sensing has become a primary instrument to monitor the land use dynamics surrounding mangrove ecosystems. Where studies formerly relied on bi-temporal assessments of change, the practical limitations concerning data-availability and processing power are slowly disappearing with the onset of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud-computing services, such as in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). This paper combines the capabilities of GEE, including its entire Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 archives and state-of-the-art classification approaches, with a post-classification temporal analysis to optimize land use classification results into gap-free and consistent information. The results demonstrate its application and value to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove forests and land use changes in Ngoc Hien District, Ca Mau province, Vietnamese Mekong delta. The combination of repeated GEE classification output and post-classification optimization provides valid spatial classification (94–96% accuracy) and temporal interpolation (87–92% accuracy). The findings reveal that the net change of mangroves forests over the 2001–2019 period equals −0.01% annually. The annual gap-free maps enable spatial identification of hotspots of mangrove forest changes, including deforestation and degradation. Post-classification temporal optimization allows for an exploitation of temporal patterns to synthesize and enhance independent classifications towards more robust gap-free spatial maps that are temporally consistent with logical land use transitions. The study contributes to a growing body of work advocating full exploitation of temporal information in optimizing land cover classification and demonstrates its use for mangrove forest monitoring. © MDPI AG.

Developments In Land Information Systems: Examples Demonstrating Land Resource Management Capabilities And Options,"Land Information Systems (LIS) provide a foundation for supporting decision-making across a broad spectrum of natural resource applications: agronomic, environmental, engineering and public good. Typically, LIS constitute a computerized database repository holding geospatial components, mapping unit' geometry and related georeferenced materials such as satellite imagery, meteorological observations and predictions and scanned legacy mapping. Coupled with the geospatial data are associated property, semantic and metadata, representing a range of thematic properties and characteristics of the land and environment. This paper provides examples of recent developments of national and regional LIS, presenting applications for land resource capabilities and management. These focus on the Land Information System' (LandIS) for England and Wales, and the World Soil Survey Archive and Catalogue' (WOSSAC) and consider Agricultural Land Classification in Wales, an Irish land and soil information system, and a scheme to optimize land suitability for application of palm oil biofertilizers in Malaysia. Land Information Systems support purposeful environmental interpretations, drawing on soil and related thematic data, offering insight into land properties, capabilities and characteristics. The examples highlight the practical transferability and extensibility of technical and methodological approaches across geographical contexts.

"Practicing Critical Zone Observation In Agricultural Landscapes: Communities, Technology, Environment And Archaeology","The aims of agricultural land management change continuously, reflecting shifts in wider societal priorities. Currently, these include addressing the climate crisis, promoting environmental sustainability, and supporting the livelihoods of rural communities while ensuring food security. Working toward these aims requires information on the character of agricultural land and how dynamic processes influence it. Remote and near-surface sensing data are important sources of information on the characteristics of soils, plants, water, topography, and related processes. Sensing data are collected, analysed, and used in decision-making by specialists in multiple domains connected to land management. While progress has been made to connect the use of sensing data across agricultural and environmental applications under the umbrella of integrated sustainable land management, archaeological and heritage uses of these data remain largely disconnected. This creates barriers to accounting for the impacts of past human activities on contemporary agricultural landscapes through the alteration of soils, topography, and plant communities. In parallel, it hinders the creation of knowledge about the archaeological features which form an essential part of the heritage of agricultural landscapes. The ipaast-czo project explores the potential of a coordinated approach across all these domains, which would reduce these barriers and provide benefits by better integrating information generated using sensing. To do so, both conceptual and practical barriers to developing shared practices and how these might be overcome were considered. In this study, a conceptual framework designed to create a shared understanding of how agricultural landscapes work and enable collaboration around their management was proposed. This framework treats present-day rural agricultural landscapes as Critical Zones: complex entities shaped by long-term human-environment interactions including contemporary farming. Practitioners in precision agriculture and archaeological remote and near-surface sensing, as well as users of these data, were engaged using workshops and interviews. The relationships between practitioners' objectives, data requirements for their applications, and their perceptions of the benefits and disadvantages of changing working practices were interrogated. The conceptual framework and assessment of practical benefits and challenges emerging from this work provide a foundation for leveraging shared sensing data and methods for long-term integrated sustainable land management.",NA,NA,10.3390/land12010179,included,NA
High Resolution Satellite Image Orientation Models,"A few years ago high resolution satellite imagery became available to a limited number of government and defense agencies that managed such imagery with highly sophisticated software and hardware tools. Such images became available to civil users in 1999 with the launch of Ikonos, the first civil satellite offering a spatial resolution of 1 m. Since then other high resolution satellites have been launched, among which there are EROS-A (1.8 m), QuickBird (0.61 m), Orbview-3 (1 m), EROS-B (0.7 m), Worldview-1 (0.5 m) and GeoEye-1 (0.41 m), with many others being planned to launch in the near future. High resolution satellite imagery is now available in different formats and processing levels at an affordable price. The diverse types of sensors and their growing availability are revolutionizing the role of satellite imagery in a number of applications, ranging from intelligency to insurance, media, marketing, agriculture, utilities, urban planning, forestry, environmental monitoring, transportation, real estate etc. As a possible alternative to aerial imagery, high resolution satellite imagery has also impact in cartographic applications, such as in orthophoto production, especially for areas where the organization of photogrammetric surveying may be critical. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-1-4419-0050-0_4,included,NA
Rejuvenation Of Agriculture In India: Cost Benefits In Using Eo Products,"India is looking for rejuvenating its sagging agricultural production and productivity by integrating high technology space inputs for both irrigated and rainfed areas. The Earth Observations (EO) products today serve as major inputs to policy, planning and targeted interventions, contributing to building social capitals, natural resources assets and environmental gains on the long-term basis. The benefits are mostly indirect and often difficult to quantify in terms of money. The cost benefit analysis of EO products is therefore an involved exercise and not many examples exist globally. The present paper, taking into account major national as well as some local level agriprojects in India, highlights the criticality of EO products in terms of their short-term as well as long-term economic and social values. Three aspects viz., catalytic, timeliness and enabling have been analyzed to visualize the role of EO products in a holistic fashion. In the catalytic role, EO inputs have been found to play a role in the successful implementation of major natural resources development projects. The cost of EO inputs may be of less than 2-5% to the total cost of the development projects, but the nature of such inputs are critical and catalytic. For example, a major project on reclamation of around 0.6 Mha sodic soils in Indo-Gangetic Plans costs US$89 million where EO products costs less than 2%; but demonstrates their catalytic roles in terms of identification, monitoring and evaluation and as inputs to mid-course corrections. The second aspect is timeliness in terms of opportunity cost. In India, Forecasting Agricultural Output Using Space-borne, Agro-meteorological and Land Observations (FASAL) project is carried out for in-season multiple crop production forecasting in support of strategic decision on trade, price and procurements. In the past, timely forecasts from FASAL have been found to be accurate and helpful for the country to plan many of its activities, including taking early decisions on wheat import to meet the shortfalls. The enabling role EO products have been demonstrated in several projects especially those related to building physical and social infrastructure and also natural resources assets building. The cost effective role EO has played in the watershed development planning and implementation in India, including improving the livelihoods as well as natural resources assets building, is one success story worth emulating in many developing countries. The most important aspect, however, is how the information is put to use for decision making and actual ground level implementation. The paper attempts to provide a glimpse of these aspects in a coherent fashion. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.12.027,included,NA
Discharge Estimation And Forecasting By Modis And Altimetry Data In Niger-Benue River,"Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world and its forecast is essential in flood risk reduction and disaster response decision. The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting. In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2. The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Network For High-Speed Sar Ship Detection,"As an active microwave imaging sensor for the high-resolution earth observation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been extensively applied in military, agriculture, geology, ecology, oceanography, etc., due to its prominent advantages of all-weather and all-time working capacity. Especially, in the marine field, SAR can provide numerous high-quality services for fishery management, traffic control, sea-ice monitoring, marine environmental protection, etc. Among them, ship detection in SAR images has attracted more and more attention on account of the urgent requirements of maritime rescue and military strategy formulation. Nowadays, most researches are focusing on improving the ship detection accuracy, while the detection speed is frequently neglected, regardless of traditional feature extraction methods or modern deep learning (DL) methods. However, the high-speed SAR ship detection is of great practical value, because it can provide real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military planning. Therefore, in order to address this problem, we proposed a novel high-speed SAR ship detection approach by mainly using depthwise separable convolution neural network (DS-CNN). In this approach, we integrated multi-scale detection mechanism, concatenation mechanism and anchor box mechanism to establish a brand-new light-weight network architecture for the high-speed SAR ship detection. We used DS-CNN, which consists of a depthwise convolution (D-Conv2D) and a pointwise convolution (P-Conv2D), to substitute for the conventional convolution neural network (C-CNN). In this way, the number of network parameters gets obviously decreased, and the ship detection speed gets dramatically improved. We experimented on an open SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) to validate the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method. To verify the strong migration capacity of our method, we also carried out actual ship detection on a wide-region large-size Sentinel-1 SAR image. Ultimately, under the same hardware platform with NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU, the experimental results indicated that the ship detection speed of our proposed method is faster than other methods, meanwhile the detection accuracy is only lightly sacrificed compared with the state-of-art object detectors. Our method has great application value in real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military planning.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11212483,included,NA
Measurement Of Seagrass Standing Crop Using Satellite And Digital Airborne Remote Sensing,"The standing crop of seagrass is highly sensitive to environmental disturbance. We evaluate 3 optical remote sensing methods for measuring standing crop in the tropical Western Atlantic. Extensive field measurements of standing crop were used to define empirical relationships with imagery from satellite sensors {[}Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT (Systeme Probatoire de l'Observation de la Terre) XS (multispectral)], and the digital airborne imager CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Predictions of standing crop from processed imagery had high coefficients of determination: 0.74, 0.79 and 0.81 respectively. Using a bootstrap method to measure standard error, the 95\% confidence interval of predictions was found to have a similar order of magnitude to quadrat sampling in situ at a precision (standard error/mean) of 10\%. Explicit cost-benefit and monitoring considerations are discussed.",NA,NA,10.3354/meps159051,included,NA
Remote Sensing Satellites And Privacy: A Framework For Policy Assessment,"Current and forthcoming capabilities of remote sensing technology will affect the ease with which satellites provide newer or less expensive means for uncovering otherwise private information. Consequently, RSS (Remote Sensing Satellites) technology is moving from the relatively obscure domains of oil companies and military strategists to the attention of those concerned with privacy rights and the social, political, and economic consequences of access to and distribution of information. We explicate factors determining how, if at all, to control the use and availability of information gathered by remote sensing satellites. While we discuss the intrinsic value of privacy, we emphasize the economic and social objectives privacy rights instrumental^ promote, such as incentives to generate information and to promote competition or cooperation. To evaluate the need for policy regarding RSS data flows, we propose some generalizations on the effects and desirability of RSS-supplied information. An important consideration is the extent to which relations between the observer and the observed should be regarded as adversarial or complementary. Applying the framework to four categories of problematic situations, depending upon whether the observer or the observed are private parties or governmental entities, illuminates the effects RSS may have on market competition, political systems, civil liberties, and international agreements. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Selecting Optimal Prices And Outpost Locations For Rural Vaccination Campaigns,"A contingent valuation survey (willingness-to-pay study) was conducted in 2004 to measure household demand for typhoid vaccines in a rural township in China with approximately 54,000 people living in 141 villages. The results showed that travel distance to vaccination sites and vaccination price affected the private demand for typhoid fever vaccinations. The number and location of vaccination outposts are thus important decision variables for a new vaccination campaign that is under consideration. This article develops and applies an optimization model for planning vaccination programs. The model determines what price to charge, how many vaccination outposts to use, where to locate them, and what capacities they need. The model uses demand information from the contingent valuation survey and cost information from similar vaccination campaigns in China and assumes that costs must be covered by user fees. The model determined that the number of outposts to use for maximizing coverage was fourteen, which would make average one-way travel distance for users about 0.6 km. The optimal vaccination price was USD 1.25, and about 87 percent of the population would be vaccinated. A suboptimal solution of the model showed that only 6 outposts instead of 14 would probably vaccinate about 83 percent of the population, and the price could be reduced to USD 0.83. The model is easy to use and solve and can be applied to different size regions. © 2012 SAGE Publications.",NA,NA,10.1177/0160017612461505,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Methodological Processes For The Placement Of Satellite Transmitters In Hard-Shelled Sea Turtles On Nesting Beaches,"Sea turtles are migratory species that occupy several marine and coastal habitats along their different life stages. The study of the spatial and temporal distribution of these vertebrates has been revolutionized with technological advances such as satellite telemetry, which in the last two decades has substantially increased its implementation. This technology attends the need of knowing and locating their critical habitats (such as inter-nesting, migrating, feeding and mating) as well as know their migratory movements for the understanding of their biology and protection through the deployment of satellite transmitters on sea turtle individuals. Because the cost of a satellite transmitter is high, its effective deployment on a sea turtle in a quickly, safely, and firmly way is of vital interest to the researcher to ensure that the transmitter persists for an extended time maximizing the information contribution and benefit the research. In this context, the objective of this contribution is to describe and document experiences applying standardized and verified methodological steps for deploying satellite transmitters on hard shell marine turtles. This contribution represents a documented and step-by-step viable description on the path to have clear and versatile basis as reference for the satellite transmitter deployments.",NA,NA,10.22370/rbmo.2018.53.2.1289,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Development Of Modis Data-Based Algorithm For Retrieving Sea Surface Temperature In Coastal Waters,"A new algorithm was developed for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) in coastal waters using satellite remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua platform. The new SST algorithm was trained using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method and tested using 8 years of remote sensing data from MODIS Aqua sensor and in situ sensing data from the US coastal waters in Louisiana, Texas, Florida, California, and New Jersey. The ANN algorithm could be utilized to map SST in both deep offshore and particularly shallow nearshore waters at the high spatial resolution of 1 km, greatly expanding the coverage of remote sensing-based SST data from offshore waters to nearshore waters. Applications of the ANN algorithm require only the remotely sensed reflectance values from the two MODIS Aqua thermal bands 31 and 32 as input data. Application results indicated that the ANN algorithm was able to explaining 82–90% variations in observed SST in US coastal waters. While the algorithm is generally applicable to the retrieval of SST, it works best for nearshore waters where important coastal resources are located and existing algorithms are either not applicable or do not work well, making the new ANN-based SST algorithm unique and particularly useful to coastal resource management. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-017-6010-7,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Flirras: Fast Learning With Integrated Reward And Reduced Action Space For Online Multitask Offloading,"With the rapid development of edge data intelligence, task offloading (TO) and resource allocation (RA) optimization in multiaccess edge computing networks can significantly improve the Quality of Service (QoS). However, for the online scenario, traditional methods (e.g., game theory and numerical methods) cannot adapt to dynamic environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to adjust the policy to get long-term rewards. Nevertheless, since the joint problem of TO and RA is nonconvex and NP-hard, existing DRL methods cannot guarantee high efficiency because of the large action space. To solve the above problem, we propose a fast learning with integrated reward and reduced action space-based DRL framework (FLIRRAS), which adopts a low-complexity approach to jointly optimize TO and RA strategies. The FLIRRAS framework combines DRL with numerical methods to iteratively pursues the discrete TO and continuous RA. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to learn environmental information, which can get prior knowledge of the offloading decision. Furthermore, a novel reward integrating the utility of TO and RA is designed to motivate the agent to find the optimal policy. To solve the dilemma that the action space is too large, low-complexity convex optimization methods, i.e., subgradient projection and KKT condition, are used to supplement and adjust the decision, which reduces the network parameters and the decision space. In addition, given the dynamic online environment, we introduce the experience replay mechanism, where policy is updated regularly to reflect the best mapping between states. The experiment results show that the performance of FLIRRAS is better than greedy and other DRL approaches, and it outperforms the latest DRL method by over 18.0\% in terms of execution time.",NA,NA,10.1109/jiot.2022.3222295,excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Advanced Optimization Of Satellite Image Observation Matrices Via Orthogonal Trigonometric Decomposition And Karhunen-Loève Transform,"Satellite imagery, known for its high resolution and abundant informational content, presents unique opportunities for observation and reconstruction via compressed sensing. Despite the potential, inherent limitations in current compressed sensing observation matrices pose substantial challenges, primarily attributed to pronounced random fluctuations and inadequate robustness. Moreover, these matrices remain unsuccessful in eliminating spectral correlations. To mitigate these challenges, an innovative approach, rooted in Orthogonal Trigonometric Decomposition and Karhunen-Loève Transform, is proposed, hereafter referred to as QRKL. This method demonstrates a marked improvement in optimizing the observation matrix, which is pivotal in compressed sensing specifically in the context of satellite image observation and reconstruction. Experimentally, when applied as the observation matrix, the QRKL transform matrix was observed to significantly enhance the reconstruction quality, stability, and anti-interference capabilities of satellite images. These improvements were noticeably superior compared to those achieved with standard observation matrices such as Gaussian and Bernoulli matrices. Furthermore, the utility of the QRKL optimization method extends beyond specific matrices, demonstrating a broad applicability to traditional observation matrices. This universal application implies that the QRKL method could potentially revolutionize compressed sensing practices in satellite imagery, leading to improved image reconstruction quality. The compelling results of this investigation suggest that QRKL transform-based optimization could provide a novel and powerful tool for advancing satellite imagery compressed sensing methodologies, thereby pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art. © 2023 Lavoisier.

Effect Of The Equality Health Bwindi Scheme On Utilization Of Health Services At Bwindi Community Hospital In Uganda,"Introduction: eQuality Health Bwindi (eQHB), a Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme was launched in March 2010 with the aim of generating income to maintain high quality care as well as increasing access to and utilization of health services at Bwindi Community Hospital (BCH). The main objective of this study was to explore evidence showing that eQHB scheme affected access and utilization of health services at BCH. The evidence generated would be used to inform decision making, policy and scale up of the scheme. Methods and Materials: This study applied qualitative and quantitative research methods. It involved a review of hospital records for the period July 2009-June 2014, a survey of 272 households, four focus group discussions, and six key informant interviews. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques were applied for the analysis. Results: Outpatient attendance, inpatient admissions, and deliveries at the hospital increased by 65, 73, and 27\%, respectively between FY 2009/10 and FY 2012/13. Utilization of health services by sick children from insured participants was greater than that of the uninsured members of the community (p -value = 0.0038). BCH services became more affordable. However, opting out of the scheme at a later stage in the review period was attributed to rising unaffordable premiums and co-payments. Failure to afford scheme membership, residing far from BCH and limited understanding of health insurance led to reduced BCH service utilization. Conclusions: eQHB has potential to increase access and utilization of health services at BCH. The challenges are; limited understanding of the concept of health insurance and unaffordable premiums and co-payments set to enable provision of high quality services. Recommendations: Based on these findings, intensified community sensitization on health insurance, establishment of satellite health facilities by BCH to bring services closer to members and transformation of eQHB to a savings/credit society in order to grow savings and subsequently reduce premiums are recommended. Government of Uganda should engage CBHIs countrywide to discuss achievement of UHC and establishment of a national health insurance scheme. A further study to guide setting of affordable premiums and copayments for eQHB is also recommended.",NA,NA,10.3389/fpubh.2019.00071,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Improved Cnn-Based Catboost Model For License Plate Remote Sensing Image Classification,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought profound technical changes to many traditional industries, among which intelligent transportation has become a hot spot for development in the traditional transportation field. Remote sensing license plate image recognition technology is extensively emphasized in such domains as intelligent transportation and intelligent vehicle management. However, in the practical traffic environment, low visibility scenes caused by complex environmental factors such as rain, snow, haze and cloudy days influence the recognition and classification of license plates, while the distortion of license plate images that may be caused by irregular movements of vehicles bring challenges to license plate recognition classification. The CNN-CatBoost model proposed in this paper divides the license plate recognition classification into two stages. The first stage uses the excellent performance of convolutional neural network in processing image data to extract various license plate image features; the second stage uses the CatBoost module to further process the image feature data and finally obtain the remote sensing license plate information. The model achieves outstanding results in the experiments and has practical application value. Through comparison with other network models, the CNN-CatBoost model proposed in this paper has superior performance.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.sigpro.2023.109196,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Public Health Surveillance In The U.s. Department Of Veterans Affairs: Evaluation Of The Praedico Surveillance System,"Background: Early threat detection and situational awareness are vital to achieving a comprehensive and accurate view of health-related events for federal, state, and local health agencies. Key to this are public health and syndromic surveillance systems that can analyze large data sets to discover patterns, trends, and correlations of public health significance. In 2020, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluated its public health surveillance system and identified areas for improvement. Methods: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, we assessed the ability of the Praedico Surveillance System to perform public health surveillance for a variety of health issues and evaluated its performance compared to an enterprise data solution (VA Corporate Data Warehouse), legacy surveillance system (VA ESSENCE) and a national, collaborative syndromic surveillance platform (CDC NSSP BioSense). Results: Review of system attributes found that the system was simple, flexible, and stable. Representativeness, timeliness, sensitivity, and Predictive Value Positive were acceptable but could be further improved. Data quality issues and acceptability present challenges that potentially affect the overall usefulness of the system. Conclusions: Praedico is a customizable surveillance and data analytics platform built on big data technologies. Functionality is straightforward, with rapid query generation and runtimes. Data can be graphed, mapped, analyzed, and shared with key decision makers and stakeholders. Evaluation findings suggest that future development and system enhancements should focus on addressing Praedico data quality issues and improving user acceptability. Because Praedico is designed to handle big data queries and work with data from a variety of sources, it could be enlisted as a tool for interdepartmental and interagency collaboration and public health data sharing. We suggest that future system evaluations include measurements of value and effectiveness along with additional organizations and functional assessments. © 2022, The Author(s).",NA,NA,10.1186/s12889-022-12578-2,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Review Of Field-Based Phenotyping By Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Platform,"The field-based phenotyping plays an important role in exploring the laws of crop growth and development. Accurately and rapidly acquiring phenotype of plants or cells in different environments can accelerate the efficiency of understanding the response of crops to environmental factors, which can provide theoretical and technical support for accelerating the development of crop science and prompting the sustainable development of agriculture in China. Traditional method for the determination of crop parameters is based on field sampling and mechanized high-throughput platform, which is time-consuming, and has low efficiency and incomplete spatial coverage. The development of crop science is limited by the quick and accurate acquisition of field-based phenotyping. Proximal remote sensing phenotyping platform represented by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be timely, rapid, noninvasive and efficient access to crop phenotypes, which makes it become an important means to obtain crop phenotypic information and a powerful tool to study the phenotypes. According to the latest research achievements of UAV-RSP (remote sensing platform) in analyzing the crop phenotype, the review described the advantage and disadvantage of the application of UAV-RSP with different types of sensors to field-based phenotyping, summed up the methods for quantitative remote sensing inversion of crop phenotypic information, and prospected the application of UAV-RSP to field-based phenotyping. UAV-RSP has the advantages of flexible motor, being suitable for complex field environment, timely data acquisition, high efficiency and low cost, which can be used to rapid and cost-effective phenotype judge for a large number of plots and field trials of massive germplasm. The vehicles with flying capacity without manned control have several types, ranging from multicopters and helicopters to fixed wing. The most frequently used sensors in UAV-RSP include digital camera, multispectral sensor, hyperspectral sensor, thermal imager and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems. The UAV-RSP have been used for acquiring crop traits including morphological parameters, spectrum and texture characteristics, physiological traits, and response to abiotic/biotic stress under different environments. However, the field-based phenotyping by UAV-RSP usually focuses on wheat, maize, rice and sorghum, and there are more crops that need to be investigated. And the crop phenotyping by remote sensing lacks the fusion of multi-source data. Strategies for high-throughput field-based phenotyping were investigated with different methods, which showed obvious difference of estimation accuracy. The accuracy of retrieval model for estimating field-based phenotyping depends on the climate, crops and their growth stages. Methods such as machine learning, spectral retrieval, analysis of canopy temperature and comprehensive evaluation have been widely used for field-based phenotyping by researchers. However, there exist some problems that restrict the application of UAV-based crop phenotyping. The shortcomings include the imperfection of agricultural aviation regulations, the deficiencies of phenotyping for massive germplasm, the lack of method for fast hyperspectral and LiDAR data management, the high price of sensors and the uncertainty of remote sensing retrieval model. The developments of UAV-based phenotyping are as follows: the combination of crop breeding and UAV remote sensing, the efficient data processing, the well-informed analysis of multi-source data, and the development of low-cost sensor. The results of this study have important significance for promoting the application of UAV-RSP and speeding up the development of crop science. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Urban Land Use And Land Cover Change Analysis Using Random Forest Classification Of Landsat Time Series,"Efficient implementation of remote sensing image classification can facilitate the extraction of spatiotemporal information for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. Mapping LULC change can pave the way to investigate the impacts of different socioeconomic and environmental factors on the Earth’s surface. This study presents an algorithm that uses Landsat time-series data to analyze LULC change. We applied the Random Forest (RF) classifier, a robust classification method, in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 as inputs for the 1985 to 2019 period. We also explored the performance of the pan-sharpening algorithm on Landsat bands besides the impact of different image compositions to produce a high-quality LULC map. We used a statistical pan-sharpening algorithm to increase multispectral Landsat bands’ (Landsat 7–9) spatial resolution from 30 m to 15 m. In addition, we checked the impact of different image compositions based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data such as digital elevation model (DEM) and land surface temperature (LST) on final classification accuracy based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data on final classification accuracy. We compared the classification result of our proposed method and the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLCL) map to verify the algorithm. The results show that: (1) Using pan-sharpened top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Landsat products can produce more accurate results for classification instead of using surface reflectance (SR) alone; (2) LST and DEM are essential features in classification, and using them can increase final accuracy; (3) the proposed algorithm produced higher accuracy (94.438% overall accuracy (OA), 0.93 for Kappa, and 0.93 for F1-score) than CGLCL map (84.4% OA, 0.79 for Kappa, and 0.50 for F1-score) in 2019; (4) the total agreement between the classification results and the test data exceeds 90% (93.37–97.6%), 0.9 (0.91–0.96), and 0.85 (0.86–0.95) for OA, Kappa values, and F1-score, respectively, which is acceptable in both overall and Kappa accuracy. Moreover, we provide a code repository that allows classifying Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 within GEE. This method can be quickly and easily applied to other regions of interest for LULC mapping. © 2022 by the authors.

Mapping Soil Organic Carbon Stocks In Tunisian Topsoils,"Better knowledge of the amount and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at national level is a key element for monitoring, planning and decision-making regarding soil quality management, agriculture or carbon storage options. The present study proposes for the first time a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) initiative to map SOC stocks in Tunisian topsoils (0-30 cm) at 100 m resolution, using a Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm, a range of environmental covariates, and a national database of 1540 SOC stock profiles. Our results provided a revised assessment of the SOC stock on the Tunisian territory at 391Tg C in the first 30 cm of soil profile, i.e. an average of 2.53 kg m-2. The map of SOC stocks outperformed global DSM products such as SoilGrids 2.0 in both R2 (0.44 vs. 0.15) and RMSE (1.94 vs. 2.52 kg m-2) and can be used as a benchmark against changes of land use and climate. The importance of the environmental covariates tested indicates the major role of bioclimatic data and, to a lesser extent, remote sensing images and topography-related variables. Our study did not show a significant added value of using additional covariates in relation to nationally available variables or the SOC map predicted by SoilGrids2.0. Finally, our results showed that increasing the quality and quantity of soil profile observations is most likely the best way to improve the future SOC map, starting with the northern region of Tunisia, which has the highest SOC stock predictions and uncertainties in the country. An alternative way would be the exploration of new covariates through sub-national approaches.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.geodrs.2022.e00561,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Multi-Period Planning Of Integrated Underground Logistics System Network For Automated Construction-Demolition-Municipal Waste Collection And Parcel Delivery: A Case Study,"Sustainable development goals of cities have long been threatening by the low efficiency and negative externalities of the truck-dominant forward and reverse physical distribution activities. Aiming at conquering the dilemma, this paper offers a novel integrated underground logistics system (IULS) solution that has good applicability to incorporate the wholesale automated operations of construction and demolition waste (CDW) collection, municipal solid waste (MSW) collection, and parcel deliveries. In line with a Chinese on-going new urban district development project, the prototypes of IULS including network topology, facility operations, handling workflows, and transport technical parameters are designed. An empirical-based method is proposed to estimate the demand flows of heterogeneous CDW and parcels for IULS planning. Based on a well-designed multiperiod network expansion mechanism, a bi-objective dynamic programming model is established to characterize the optimal location-allocation-routing decisions of IULS network at minimal construction and operating costs. Given the computational complexity, a hybrid optimization approach combining variable neighborhood search based memetic algorithm, Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm, and A-star algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality model solutions. Simulation based on real-world case is conducted to validate our planning techniques. Results show that the dual-use and multi-period expansion of IULS network can save millions of dollars of annual environmental governance expenditures for a satellite city with substantial rebuilding and distribution needs. By analyzing the facility configurations and cost-benefit performance of the optimized network solutions, a set of insights related to the best layout, economic feasibility, and long-term development for the prospective IULS network initiatives are disclosed.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129760,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Using High-Spatiotemporal Thermal Satellite Et Retrievals For Operational Water Use And Stress Monitoring In A California Vineyard,"In viticulture, deficit irrigation strategies are often implemented to control vine canopy growth and to impose stress at critical stages of vine growth to improve wine grape quality. To support deficit irrigation scheduling, remote sensing technologies can be employed in the mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) at the field to sub-field scales, quantifying time-varying vineyard water requirements and actual water use. In the current study, we investigate the utility of ET maps derived from thermal infrared satellite imagery over a vineyard in the Central Valley of California equipped with a variable rate drip irrigation (VRDI) system which enables differential water applications at the 30 x 30 m scale. To support irrigation management at that scale, we utilized a thermal-based multi-sensor data fusion approach to generate weekly total actual ET (ETa) estimates at 30 m spatial resolution, coinciding with the resolution of the Landsat reflectance bands. Crop water requirements (ETc) were defined with a vegetative index (VI)-based approach. To test capacity to capture stress signals, the vineyard was sub-divided into four blocks with different irrigation management strategies and goals, inducing varying degrees of stress during the growing season. Results indicate derived weekly total ET from the thermal-based data fusion approach match well with observations.

This transient stress event was not reflected in the VI-based ETc estimate, highlighting the value of thermal band imaging.

Supporting Habitat Conservation With Automated Change Detection In Google Earth Engine,"A significant limitation in biodiversity conservation has been the effective implementation of laws and regulations that protect species' habitats from degradation. Flexible, efficient, and effective monitoring and enforcement methods are needed to help conservation policies realize their full benefit. As remote sensing data become more numerous and accessible, they can be used to identify and quantify land-cover changes and habitat loss. However, these data remain underused for systematic conservation monitoring in part because of a lack of simple tools. We adapted 2 algorithms that automatically identify differences between pairs of images. We used free, publicly available satellite data to evaluate their ability to rapidly detect land-cover changes in a variety of land-cover types. We compared algorithm predictions with ground-truthed results at 100 sites of known change in the United States. We also compared algorithm predictions to manually created polygons delineating anthropogenic change in 4 case studies involving imperiled species' habitat: oil and gas development in the range of the Greater Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus); sand mining operations in the range of the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus); loss of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) coastal habitat after Hurricane Michael (2018); and residential development in St. Andrew beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus peninsularis) habitat. Both algorithms effectively discriminated between pixels corresponding to land-cover change and unchanged pixels as indicated by area under a receiver operating characteristic curve >0.90. The algorithm that was most effective differed among the case-study habitat types, and both effectively delineated habitat loss as indicated by low omission (min. = 0.0) and commission (min. = 0.0) rates, and moderate polygon overlap (max. = 47\%). Our results showed how these algorithms can be used to help close the implementation gap of monitoring and enforcement in biodiversity conservation. We provide a free online tool that can be used to run these analyses (https://conservationist.io/habitatpatrol).",NA,NA,10.1111/cobi.13680,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Employing Crowdsourced Geographic Data And Multi-Temporal/Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery To Monitor Land Cover Change: A Case Study In An Urbanizing Region Of The Philippines,"Land cover change (LCC) can have a significant impact on human and environmental well-being. LCC maps derived from historical remote sensing (RS) images are often used to evaluate the impacts of past LC changes and to construct models to predict future LC changes. Free moderate spatial resolution (-30 m) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RS imagery is now becoming increasingly available for this LCC monitoring. However, the classification algorithms used to extract LC information from these images typically require ""training data"" for classification (i.e. points or polygons with LC class labels), and acquiring this labelled training data can be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively, crowdsourced geographic data (CGD) has become widely available from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM), and it may provide a useful source of training data for LCC monitoring. A major challenge with utilizing CGD for LCC mapping, however, is the presence of class labelling errors, and these errors can vary spatially (e.g. due to differing levels of CGD contributor expertise) and temporally (e.g. due to time lag between CGD creation and RS imagery acquisition). In this study, we investigated a new LCC mapping method which utilizes free Landsat (optical) and PALSAR mosaic (SAR) satellite imagery in combination with labelled LC data extracted from CGD sources (the OSM ""landuse"" and ""natural"" polygon datasets). A semi-unsupervised classification approach was employed for the LCC mapping to reduce the effects of class label noise in the CGD. The main motivation and benefit of the proposed method is that it does not require training data to be manually collected, allowing for a faster and more automated assessment of LCC. As a case study, we applied the method to map LCC in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines over the 2007-2015 period. The LCC map produced using our proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.2\%, providing evidence that CGD and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery, when combined, have a great potential for LCC monitoring.

Deep Learning Using Physically-Informed Input Data For Wetland Identification,"Automated and accurate wetland identification algorithms are increasingly important for wetland conservation and environmental planning. Deep learning for wetland identification is an emerging field that shows promise for advancing these efforts. Deep learning is unique to traditional machine learning techniques for its ability to consider the spatial context of object characteristics within a landscape scene. However, applying deep learning typically requires very large datasets for training the algorithms, which limits their application for many environmental applications including wetland identification. Using four study sites across Virginia with field delineated wetlands, we provide insight into the potential for deep learning for wetland detection from limited, but typical, wetland delineation training data. Our proposed workflow performs a wetland semantic segmentation using DeepNets, a deep learning architecture for remote sensing data, and an input dataset consisting of high-resolution topographic indices and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Results show that models trained and evaluated for a single site were able to achieve high accuracy (up to 91\% recall and 56\% precision) and similar accuracy can be obtained for models trained across multiple sites (up to 91\% recall and 57\% precision). Through this analysis we found that, across all sites, input data configurations taking advantage of hydrologic properties derived from elevation data consistently outperformed models using the elevation data directly, showing the benefit of physically-informed inputs in deep learning training for wetland identification. By refining the wetland identification workflow presented in this paper and collecting additional training data across landscapes, there is potential for deep learning algorithms to support a range wetland conservation efforts.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104665,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Precision Livestock Farming Applied To Grazingland Monitoring And Management-A Review,"To meet the expected demand for food while protecting animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and profitability, animal production efficiency must improve. Improvements in grazinglands management techniques can impact livestock production efficiency.

This literature review presents current developments in precision livestock farming (PLF) applied to grazinglands monitoring and management, demonstrates some knowledge gaps, and discusses potential solutions of grazinglands management issues. Although the implementation of precision technologies in grazing systems is advancing rapidly, challenges, such as lack of reliable reference data and low variability of datasets used to calibrate models, are examples of constraints to be addressed in future studies. More effort in terms of relationship strengthening between farmers and researchers, benefits elucidation, cooperation among professionals with different expertise, and software or app development must be directed to make the knowledge accessible and largely implemented in field conditions.",NA,NA,10.1002/agj2.21346,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Using Spatial Reinforcement Learning To Build Forest Wildfire Dynamics Models From Satellite Images,"Machine learning algorithms have increased tremendously in power in recent years but have yet to be fully utilized in many ecology and sustainable resource management domains such as wildlife reserve design, forest fire management, and invasive species spread. One thing these domains have in common is that they contain dynamics that can be characterized as a spatially spreading process (SSP), which requires many parameters to be set precisely to model the dynamics, spread rates, and directional biases of the elements which are spreading. We present related work in artificial intelligence and machine learning for SSP sustainability domains including forest wildfire prediction. We then introduce a novel approach for learning in SSP domains using reinforcement learning (RL) where fire is the agent at any cell in the landscape and the set of actions the fire can take from a location at any point in time includes spreading north, south, east, or west or not spreading. This approach inverts the usual RL setup since the dynamics of the corresponding Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a known function for immediate wildfire spread. Meanwhile, we learn an agent policy for a predictive model of the dynamics of a complex spatial process. Rewards are provided for correctly classifying which cells are on fire or not compared with satellite and other related data. We examine the behavior of five RL algorithms on this problem: value iteration, policy iteration, Q-learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). We compare to a Gaussian process-based supervised learning approach and also discuss the relation of our approach to manually constructed, state-of-the-art methods from forest wildfire modeling. We validate our approach with satellite image data of two massive wildfire events in Northern Alberta, Canada; the Fort McMurray fire of 2016 and the Richardson fire of 2011. The results show that we can learn predictive, agent-based policies as models of spatial dynamics using RL on readily available satellite images that other methods and have many additional advantages in terms of generalizability and interpretability. © 2018 Ganapathi Subramanian and Crowley.",NA,NA,10.3389/fict.2018.00006,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Conformity Testing Of Satellite-Derived Quantitative Surface Variables,"Reliable compliance information of quantitative earth observation (EO) products is a prerequisite for future usages of satellite-derived evidence in (1) regulatory initiatives addressing air quality, development aid, climate risk, agricultural subsidies and the state of the environment among others, (2) liability debates between customers and providers of value-added (quantitative) EO products and services, and (3) auditing efforts and/or contractual negotiations for the operational exploitation of EO data. Irrespective of context, the conformity of an item can only be established with respect to permissible deviations from an agreed reference. The uncertainty of the reference should ideally be smaller than that of the candidate item, and their combined uncertainty should be smaller than the width of the interval defining permissible deviations. While these considerations are an integral part of conformity testing in legal metrology they are not yet included in validation efforts of satellite-derived quantitative surface information. Outside of scientific application contexts, however, the certified compliance of quantitative earth observation products is likely to induce new usages of such information in commercial, judiciary and regulatory contexts. This contribution introduces conformity testing and compares it to validation efforts assessing the value of biophysical EO products with respect to the quality objectives provided by the global climate observing system (GCOS). The findings suggest that, (1) current GCOS quality objectives must be complemented before they may serve as unambiguous requirements for conformity testing of EO products, (2) a consensus on the choice of decision rules must be sought (between data providers and users) since this has a direct impact on what is deemed compliant, and (3) the uncertainty associated with current field validation methods for quantitative biophysical variables is presumably too large to meet the 150-13528 criteria. The latter thus challenges the eligibility of current field validation methods to provide the reference needed in efforts assessing GCOS compliance of third party EO datasets.

Apda Water Vapor Retrieval Validation For Sentinel-2 Imagery,"Water vapor is one of the main parameters for the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 imagery. Together with the aerosol retrieval, it determines the accuracy of the surface reflectance product.

Advancing Satellite Precipitation Retrievals With Data Driven Approaches: Is Black Box Model Explainable?,"Satellite-based precipitation retrieval is an essential and long-standing scientific problem. With an increase of observational satellite data, the advances of data-driven approaches such as machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) are favored to deal with large data sets and potentially improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates. In this study, we took advantage of new technologies by wrapping up a ML/DL-based model pipeline (LinkNet segmentation + tree ensemble). This approach is applied to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 18 and 19 flight, and compared with the MultiRadar MultiSensor. Four simulations were configured to examine the performance gain by incorporating three components: (1) precipitation identification, (2) nonlocal features, and (3) precipitation classification. More importantly, we examined the interpretability of the ""black box"" model to get a better understanding of the underlying physical connections. First, the results by this model pipeline suggest the advantages of the ML model by reducing the systematic error and instantaneous error to a factor of two. Second, identifying precipitation pixels helps to reduce the systematic error by 130\%, and predicting precipitation classification benefits improved correlations by 32\%. Last, channels at higher frequencies (beyond 150 GHz) are favored to identify precipitation regions, and also channels at 89 and 150 GHz are ranked as the two most important features to precipitation retrieval. This study explores the potentials of AMSU precipitation estimates with ML algorithms and provides means of interpreting the models to facilitate the better prediction of precipitation. Plain Language Summary Accurate precipitation estimations could undoubtedly benefit water resources management and decision makings. As the precipitation data explode, especially for remote sensing, there is a growing opportunity to leverage these myriads of data to advance the satellite retrieval algorithms. In this study, we apply this novel machine learning/deep learning pipeline with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-18 and NOAA-19 satellite to compare with an operational retrieval algorithm. Beyond that, the black box model interpretability is explored to discover how the model predicts the outcome. The results prove that this model not only outperforms than the operational product, it but also makes physical sense with respect to its functionality.",NA,NA,10.1029/2020ea001423,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Estimation Of Grassland Yield From Satellite Data With Ann Based Transfer Learning,"Knowing site-specific yields in grassland and especially predicting yield in advance, is valuable information for many dairy farmers all over the world. Site-specific yield information can be used for in-field-logistics and objective farm resource planning. Satellite-based yield prediction allows estimating yields before the harvest. One of the biggest challenges with satellite data processing in the VIS and NIR range are atmospheric disturbances, like clouds. State-of-the-art methods usually use traditional approaches to interpolate data and typically do not consider weather data in the interpolations or forecasts. In our work, a model for the prediction of vegetation indices is developed. Based on this model, the grassland yield is predicted. Using the latest available satellite measurements and past or current weather data the model tries to predict the expected yields. Our new method uses deep learning with an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the vegetation indices NDVI, EVI, REIP, CIRE, LAI, NDWI, FAPAR, and FCOVER from Sentinel- 2 and weather-data. This helps to reduce the gaps in time series from missing or unusable satellite data. Furthermore the bands red, green and blue are also evaluated. The model predicts the crop label parallel to the index calculation. Based on the trained model we use transfer learning to predict the biomass, i.e., the grassland yield, from a small number of training samples (n=292). Our experiment showed that the indices, including RGB bands, can be predicted with a mean Pearson correlation of 0.933, within a range of 0 to 20 days from the last satellite picture. Increasing the range to 20 to 90 days, this value drops to 0.809. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) prediction achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.949. The best correlation is achieved by the NDVI with a Pearson correlation of 0.959. The crop type can be predicted at an accuracy of 47.6% in the category grassland crops. We are also able to predict the grassland yield with a Pearson correlation of 0.891. © 2022, VDI Verlag GMBH. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.51202/9783181023952-293,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Science And Policy Lessons Learned From A Decade Of Adaptation To The Emergent Risk Of Sargassum Proliferation Across The Tropical Atlantic,"Climatic and anthropogenic changes appear to be driving the emergence of new ecosystem and human health risks. As new risks emerge, and the severity or frequency of known risks change, we ask: what evidence is there of past adaptations to emergent risks? What scientific and policy processes lead to adaptive solutions that minimise the impacts of these events, and draw out opportunities? We identify science and policy lessons learned from coping with, and responding to, the sudden arrival of brown macroalgae (pelagic sargassum) that has proliferated across the tropical Atlantic since 2011. Drawing on an evidence base developed from a systematic search of literature relating to sargassum seaweed, and using event timelines and word clouds, we provide an analysis of lessons learned from a case study of adaptive responses across three continents to an emergent risk over the course of a decade. We reflect on successes and failures as well as opportunities taken in building adaptive capacity to address the risk in four key domains: policy, knowledge and evidence, monitoring and early warning, and technology and valorisation. Failures include: lack of environmental risk registries; missed opportunities to share monitoring data; and lack of a shared approach to manage the risk. Successes include: development of national management strategies; open-access knowledge hubs, networks and webinars sharing information and best practice; semi-operational early advisory systems using open access remote sensing data; numerous innovations customising clean-up and harvesting equipment, and research and development of new uses and value-added products.",NA,NA,10.1088/2515-7620/acd493,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Functional Classification Of Urban Buildings In High Resolution Remote Sensing Images Through Poi-Assisted Analysis,"As the space for human habitation and activity, urban buildings are an important part of the city. Their renewal and renovation affects development of the city and changes people's life at all times. Functional classification of urban buildings provides supporting evidence for categorizing urban functional areas, and also helps the government in land use planning, as well as managing the distribution of population and resources, promoting the sustainable development of urban areas. However, current classification technology of remote sensing is insufficient to make functional classification of urban buildings. In this paper, we analyzed urban information in great depth, by classifying the function of urban buildings. The efficiency and precision of the classification is improved after combining remote sensing, the Internet POI (Point of Interest) data and GIS technology. We first chose the method of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to extract building information from remote sensing images of high resolution. The precision of the extraction is above 93% as is shown by precision evaluation. POI data was then classified into 3 types by manual work, namely buildings used for commercial service, public service and residence. The classified POI data were estimated by Kernel Density. After which the mean Kernel Density value of every type of buildings was calculated and these three types of buildings were delimited by thresholds. Thus, buildings for commercial service, public service and residence could be recognized from the building information assisted by POI data, achieving the functional classification of urban buildings. This method has shown good extraction efficiency compared to visual interpretation-the overall accuracy is 86.85% and Kappa Coefficient is 0.8153 according to precision evaluation. In future research, this method can be used to classify and identify different types of urban buildings. However, there are still some problems to be discussed in this method. For example, when defining buildings' functional types by threshold of Kernel Density, one building may have more than one or no type. Besides, POI data have some limitations when representing the range of different types of buildings: one point may represent either a grand shopping mall or a convenience store. These will be addressed in future studies. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.",NA,NA,10.3724/sp.j.1047.2017.00831,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Sslndo-Based Deep Residual Network And Rv-Coefficient Integrated Deep Fuzzy Clustering For Cotton Crop Classification,"The excellent classification accuracy of remote sensory images has led to a major expansion of their use in agricultural field surveillance in recent years. The accurate classification of crop is very significant for agricultural management and food security. There are diverse varieties of crops are available. Among them, each possesses same spectral curves. Due to increasing number of remote sensing information, a major limitation arises in the domain of crop classification is how to determine significant data from huge volume of information to maintain categorization accuracy and implementation time. Consequently, one of the main obstacles in the agricultural industry is the precise classification of crops. Deep Residual Network (ResNet)-based Social Sea Lion Driver Optimization (SSLnDO)-based Deep Fuzzy Clustering (DFC), where the distance is calculated using RV coefficient, are used to develop an effective method for classifying cotton crops. Finally, classification of the cotton crop is successfully accomplished using Deep ResNet, and the network classifier is trained by inserting produced SSLnDO. The vegetation index is generated for each color band independently. Combining the Social Ski Driver (SSD) optimization and the Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO) method yields the newly developed SSLnDO. A maximum testing accuracy of 0.940, a sensitivity of 0.931, and a specificity of 0.926 have been achieved by the designed model. When comparing the accuracy value produced by the proposed method for image-2 to the existing approaches, namely WLI-Fuzzy + BS-Lion NN, OSVM-OCNN, GAN, Hybrid CNN-RF, Deep learning, and Deep ResNet, they are 15.21\%, 11.06\%, 15.21\%, 9.04\%, 4.36\%, and 2.3\% higher.",NA,NA,10.1142/s0219622023500086,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Rain Attenuation Prediction Model For Satellite Communications Based On The Meteo-France Ensemble Prediction System Pearp,"This paper presents an example of the usage of ensemble weather forecasting for the control of satellite-based communication systems. Satellite communication systems become increasingly sensitive to weather conditions as their operating frequency increases to avoid electromagnetic spectrum congestion and enhance their capacity. In the microwave domain, electromagnetic waves that are conveying information are attenuated between the satellite and Earth terminals in the presence of hydrometeors (mostly rain drops and more marginally cloud droplets). To maintain a reasonable level of service availability, even with adverse weather conditions considering the scarcity of amplification power in spacecraft, fade mitigation techniques have been developed. The general idea behind those fade mitigation techniques is to reroute, change the characteristics or reschedule the transmission in the case of too-significant propagation impairments. For some systems, a scheduling on how to use those mechanisms some hours in advance is required, making assumptions on the future weather conditions affecting the link To this aim the use of weather forecast data to control the attenuation compensation mechanisms seems of particular interest to maximize the performances of the communication links and hence of the associated economic value. A model to forecast the attenuation on the link based on forecasted rainfall amounts from deterministic or ensemble weather forecasting is presented and validated. In a second phase, the model's application to a simplified telecommunication system allows us to demonstrate the valuable contribution of weather forecasting in the system's availability optimization or in the system's throughput optimization. The benefit of using ensemble forecasts rather than deterministic ones is demonstrated as well.",NA,NA,10.5194/nhess-18-3327-2018,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Decentralisation Of Radiation Therapy. Is It Possible And Beneficial To Patients? Experience Of The First 5 Years Of A Satellite Radiotherapy Unit In The Province Of Tarragona, Spain","Background: The concept of satellite radiotherapy originates in countries whose populations are largely dispersed in order to treat homogenously the population by a unique fixed team. Aim: This report describes the creation and management of a satellite radiotherapy unit in Spain (RUTE-Radiotherapy Unit, Terres de l'Ebre). It is managed by the Radiation Oncology Department at Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus. We report the benefit gained in the comfort of patients and the economic benefit gained by reducing the expense of transport for the health care system. Materials and methods: RUTE is equipped with a linear accelerator. A team of 10 physicians, specialised in different oncology pathologies, travel to RUTE on a rotational basis from the main Radiation Oncology Department. Simulation and planning of treatment is managed at the Radiation Oncology Department in Reus. Patients from RUTE only have to visit the centre in Reus once throughout the treatment process. Results: Since August 2008, 1500 patients have completed treatment in the satellite unit. The implementation of RUTE has greatly improved the comfort of patients and along with that, there have been important savings in transport costs to the regional health care system. Conclusions: Despite the high technological requirements of our speciality, decentralising radiotherapy is feasible. We can guarantee the highest standards of treatment with no differences from attending the main centre. It implies a clear benefit for the comfort of the patients and an economic benefit by decreasing transport costs. (C) 2014 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.

Mmflood: A Multimodal Dataset For Flood Delineation From Satellite Imagery,"Accurate flood delineation is crucial in many disaster management tasks, such as risk map production and update, impact estimation, claim verification, or planning of countermeasures for disaster risk reduction. Open remote sensing resources such as the data provided by the Copernicus ecosystem enable to carry out this activity, which benefits from frequent revisit times on a global scale. In the last decades, satellite imagery has been successfully applied to flood delineation problems, especially considering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals. However, current remote mapping services rely on time-consuming manual or semi-automated approaches, requiring the intervention of domain experts. The implementation of accurate and scalable automated pipelines is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To address these issues, we propose MMFlood, a multimodal remote sensing dataset purposely designed for flood delineation. The dataset contains 1,748 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, comprising 95 flood events distributed across 42 countries. Along with satellite imagery, the dataset includes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrography maps, and flood delineation maps provided by Copernicus EMS, which is considered as ground truth. To provide baseline performances on the MMFlood test set, we conduct a number of experiments of the flood delineation task using state-of-art deep learning models, and we evaluate the performance gains of entropy-based sampling and multi-encoder architectures, which are respectively used to tackle two of the main challenges posed by MMFlood, namely the class unbalance and the multimodal setting.

"Towards A Green Sustainable Strategy For Mediterranean Cities: Assessing The Benefits Of Large-Scale Green Roofs Implementation In Thessaloniki, Northern Greece, Using Environmental Modelling, Gis And Very High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data","In the Mediterranean area, rural abandonment and the rapid urbanisation after the 1950's have led to complex environmental problems, such as the exploitation of natural resources, the environmental pollution and the rapid increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Especially the unrestrained urban growth caused excessive pressure on the existing infrastructure, which affects buildings, public transportation, road networks, water quality, waste collection and public health. Green roofs are emerging building technologies that can help communities mitigate some of the above mentioned problems. Various studies have demonstrated that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate some of these environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of heat losses through the building's envelope, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling as well as the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this line of thought, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. To delineate the available green roof areas, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Potential green roof extent was extracted with a mean error of 8.78 m(2), and discriminated from staircases, penthouse setbacks and terracotta tiles. Subsequently GIS were used to extrapolate the results from the building to the city scale. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations. The green roof potential in Thessaloniki approximated 17\% of the gross built areas of the city, which means that there is a strong potential for green roof retrofit. Depending on the vegetation type installed in an extensive green roof, C stocks in Thessaloniki can increase by 2.5 times, while the dynamic energy simulations suggested that in certain city blocks reduced heating and cooling consumptions up to 5\% and 16\% respectively could be achieved. In regard to rainwater retention, implementation of green roofs in Thessaloniki is estimated to contribute in rainwater retention by almost 45\%, allowing more than half of the rainwater precipitation to be reserved at the 50\% of the city blocks.

Refined Systems Of National Accounts And Experimental Ecosystem Accounting Versus The Simplified Agroforestry Accounting System: Testing In Andalusian Holm Oak Open Woodlands,"The scientific debate over how to make visible the connections between the standard System of National Accounts (SNA) and its ongoing satellite Environmental Economic Ecosystem Accounting-Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA) is a challenge that is still pending. The literature on environmental accounting of agroforestry and silvopastoral landscapes rarely values the multiple ecosystem services of an area, an economic unit (e.g., farm), or a vegetation type (e.g., holm oak-Quercus ilex L.-open woodland). Generally, the literature presents the market value of the products consumed directly or a correction of the latter that reduces their exchange values in order to approximate them to their resource rents. In our previous publications, we have applied and compared our Agroforestry Accounting System (AAS) with the System of National Accounts (SNA), and we refined the latter to avoid the lag between income generation and its accounting in the period in which the product is extracted. These previous publications did not develop experimental applications of the SEEA-EEA with comparisons to the SNA and it being integrated into the AAS. The main novelty of this article is that, for the first time, we present detailed applications and comparisons of our developments of the refined SEEA-EEA and refined SNA with a simplified version of the AAS. The accounting frameworks applied take the production and capital accounts in the process of being updated by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) at the scale of the holm oak open woodlands of Andalusia into account. In this study, we compare three environmental accounting approaches for ecosystem services and environmental income measurements at basic and social prices: our slightly refined standard System of National Accounts (rSNA); our refined, updated and ongoing satellite System of Environmental Economic Accounting-Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (rSEEA-EEA); and our simplified Agroforestry Accounting System (sAAS). We tested them for 15 economic activities in 1408 thousand hectares of the predominantly mixed holm oak open woodland (HOW) land use tiles in the region of Andalusia, Spain. We considered the government institutional sector to be the collective owner of public economic activities, which we incorporated in the rSNA and the sAAS approaches. We discuss consistencies in environmental incomes identified from the results of the three ecosystem accounting frameworks applied to the HOW. The discrepancies in the measurement of ecosystem services of the government institutional sector between the rSEEA-EEA and the sAAS were due to the omission in the former of the government manufactured costs incurred in the supply of freely consumed public final products. The most notable finding of our comparison is that the ecosystem services and the environmental income results for individual market products offered the same values, whichever the ecosystem accounting framework applied. This was not the case with the ecosystem services of public products without market prices, due to the fact that the rSNA estimates these products at production cost and the rSEEA-EEA did not consider the government manufactured production costs and ordinary manufactured net operating margin of government final public product consumption. We also found that, according to modeling of the scheduled management of future biological resources of the HOW, the environmental income shows biological sustainability of the individual nature-based total product consumption.",NA,NA,10.3390/f11040393,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Spatiotemporal Downscaling Approaches For Monitoring 8-Day 30 M Actual Evapotranspiration,"Continuous monitoring of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for water resources management at both regional and local scales. Although the MODIS ET product (MOD16A2) provides viable sources for ET monitoring at 8-day intervals, the spatial resolution (1 km) is too coarse for local scale applications. In this study, we propose a machine learning and spatial temporal fusion (STF)-integrated approach in order to generate 8-day 30 m ET based on both MOD16A2 and Landsat 8 data with three schemes. Random forest machine learning was used to downscale MODIS 1 km ET to 30 m resolution based on nine Landsat-derived indicators including vegetation indices (VIs) and land surface temperature (LST). STF-based models including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model and Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion Model were used to derive synthetic Landsat surface reflectance (scheme 1)/VIs (scheme 2)/ET (scheme 3) on Landsat-unavailable dates. The approach was tested over two study sites in the United States. The results showed that fusion of Landsat VIs produced the best accuracy of predicted ET (R-2 = 0.52-0.97, RMSE = 0.47-3.0 mm/8 days and rRMSE = 6.4-37\%). High density of cloud-clear Landsat image acquisitions and low spatial heterogeneity of Landsat VIs benefit the ET prediction. The downscaled 30 m ET had good agreement with MODIS ET (RMSE = 0.42-3.4 mm/8 days, rRMSE = 3.226\%). Comparison with the in situ ET measurements showed that the downscaled ET had higher accuracy than MODIS ET. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

A Rapid Flood Risk Assessment Method For Response Operations And Nonsubject-Matter-Expert Community Planning,"Flood risk planning and emergency response at community levels rely on fast access to accurate inundation models that identify geographic areas, assets, and populations that may be flooded. However, limited flood modelling resources are available to support these events and activities. We present a computationally-efficient flood model for facilitating rapid risk analysis across a wide range of scenarios and decision support to operational, crisis action, local flood-fight, and community planning efforts. Our flood depth regression method converts publicly-available river stage heights to flood depths, then downscales the depths from gage locations onto high resolution National Hydrography Dataset flowlines and estimates areas and depths of flooding by subtraction of the National Elevation Dataset from modelled water surface elevations. We demonstrate proof-of-principle analyses for historic 2009 Red River of the North flooding in the United States, achieving comprehensive mainstem flood estimation for the length of the river and depth accuracy of 1.4 ft (0.4 m) compared to gage observations, remote sensing, and higher-resolution hydrologic models. We also demonstrate the utility of the method to inform planning and response decisions in preparation for flooding in a companion scenario for Yerington, Nevada, and call for further research and operationalization of riverine inundation mapping techniques.",NA,NA,10.1111/jfr3.12579,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Validation Of The Egsiem-Repro Gnss Orbits And Satellite Clock Corrections,"In the framework of the European Gravity Service for Improved Emergency Management (EGSIEM) project, consistent sets of state-of-the-art reprocessed Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) orbits and satellite clock corrections have been generated. The reprocessing campaign includes data starting in 1994 and follows the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) processing strategy, in particular exploiting the extended version of the empirical CODE Orbit Model (ECOM). Satellite orbits are provided for Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites since 1994 and for Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) since 2002. In addition, a consistent set of GPS satellite clock corrections with 30 s sampling has been generated from 2000 and with 5 s sampling from 2003 onwards. For the first time in a reprocessing scheme, GLONASS satellite clock corrections with 30 s sampling from 2008 and 5 s from 2010 onwards were also generated. The benefit with respect to earlier reprocessing series is demonstrated in terms of polar motion coordinates. GNSS satellite clock corrections are validated in terms of completeness, Allan deviation, and precise point positioning (PPP) using terrestrial stations. In addition, the products herein were validated with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) precise orbit determination (POD) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR).

A Latent Space-Based Estimation Of Distribution Algorithm For Large-Scale Global Optimization,"Large-scale global optimization problems (LSGOs) have received considerable attention in the field of meta-heuristic algorithms. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a major branch of meta-heuristic algorithms. However, how to effectively build the probabilistic model for EDA in high dimensions is confronted with obstacle, making them less attractive due to the large computational requirements. To overcome the shortcomings of EDAs, this paper proposed a latent space-based EDA (LS-EDA), which transforms the multivariate probabilistic model of Gaussian-based EDA into its principal component latent subspace with lower dimensionality. LS-EDA can efficiently reduce the complexity of EDA while maintaining its probability model without losing key information to scale up its performance for LSGOs. When the original dimensions are projected to the latent subspace, those dimensions with larger projected value make more contribution to the optimization process. LS-EDA can also help recognize and understand the problem structure, especially for black-box optimization problems. Due to dimensionality reduction, its computational budget and population size can be effectively reduced while its performance is highly competitive in comparison with the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms for LSGOs. In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of LS-EDA, we have carried out extensive computational studies. Our results revealed LS-EDA outperforms the others on the benchmark functions with overlap and nonseparate variables. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00500-018-3390-8,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Comparative Evaluation Between Remote Sensor And In Situ Data For Predicting The Trophic State Index From Chlorophyll “A”,"Contamination or water pollution generates several phenomena, one of which is eutrophication. As a result, with the aim of sustainable management of water resources, the Trophic State Index was developed to enable the classification of water resources in different degrees of trophicity, with remote sensing being one of the tools capable of determining such an index. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the trophic levels obtained through remote sensing analyzes with limnological analyzes of Sample of chlorophyll “a” in the laboratory. This research consists of three stages of analysis, first a water sample will be collected along seven points in the bay of Portel-PA, which in turn will be laboratory results, then the collection and treatment of satellite images will be carried out. for the prediction of chlorophyll “a”, and then the qualitative comparison of the values obtained with the previous steps through the IET. The application of the methodology allowed observing that at all points the TSI values verified by remote sensing are close to the analysis carried out in the laboratory, with the predominant classification among the points being mesotrophic. Therefore, spatial analyzes such as this one, demonstrate the importance of remote sensing as a tool for identifying the areas of occurrence of chlorophyll“a”, however, as remote sensing techniques used in this work, they were not able to replace field work. They only allowed a more efficient remote planning and monitoring of the actions to be carried out in the final stage. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Optical Remote Sensing Of Glacier Characteristics: A Review With Focus On The Himalaya,"The increased availability of remote sensing platforms with appropriate spatial and temporal resolution, global coverage and low financial costs allows for fast, semi-automated, and cost-effective estimates of changes in glacier parameters over large areas. Remote sensing approaches allow for regular monitoring of the properties of alpine glaciers such as ice extent, terminus position, volume and surface elevation, from which glacier mass balance can be inferred. Such methods are particularly useful in remote areas with limited field-based glaciological measurements. This paper reviews advances in the use of visible and infrared remote sensing combined with field methods for estimating glacier parameters, with emphasis on volume/area changes and glacier mass balance. The focus is on the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor and its applicability for monitoring Himalayan glaciers. The methods reviewed are: volumetric changes inferred from digital elevation models (DEMs), glacier delineation algorithms from multi-spectral analysis, changes in glacier area at decadal time scales, and AAR/ELA methods used to calculate yearly mass balances. The current limitations and on-going challenges in using remote sensing for mapping characteristics of mountain glaciers also discussed, specifically in the context of the Himalaya.",NA,NA,10.3390/s8053355,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Deriving Hourly Evapotranspiration Rates With Sebs: A Lysimetric Evaluation,"Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) is one of the widely used surface EB methods for deriving ET rates from remote sensing data. It does not require subjective selection of hot and cold pixels for deriving ET. However, the SEBS has never been evaluated for its ability to estimate ET using lysimetric measurements. In this study, we evaluated the SEBS for estimating ET using Landsat 5 satellite data for summer crops in the Southern High Plains. Performance statistics indicated that SEBS performance was equally good in estimating hourly ET on both dryland and irrigated fields. Numerous energy balance (EB) algorithms have been developed to use remote sensing data for mapping evapotranspiration (ET) on a regional basis. Adopting any single or combination of these models for an operational ET remote sensing program requires a thorough evaluation. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) was evaluated for its ability to estimate hourly ET rates of summer tall and short crops grown in the Texas High Plains by using 15 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes acquired during 2006 to 2009. Performance of SEBS was evaluated by comparing estimated hourly ET values with measured ET data from four large weighing lysimeters, each located at the center of a 4.3 ha field in the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, TX. The performance of SEBS in estimating hourly ET was good for crops under both irrigated and dryland conditions. A locally derived, surface albedo-based soil heat flux (G) model further improved the G estimates. Root mean square error and mean bias error were 0.11 and -0.005 mm h-1, respectively, and the Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency was 0.85 between the measured and calculated hourly ET. Considering the equal or better performance with a minimal amount of ancillary data as compared to with other EB algorithms, SEBS is a promising tool for use in an operational ET remote sensing program in the semiarid Texas High Plains. However, thorough sensitivity and error propagation analyses of input variables to quantify their impact on ET estimations for the major crops in the Texas High Plains under different agroclimatological conditions are needed before adopting the SEBS into operational ET remote sensing programs for irrigation scheduling or other purposes. © Soil Science Society of America 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

Optical Cloud Pixel Recovery Via Machine Learning,"Remote sensing derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used index to monitor vegetation and land use change. NDVI can be retrieved from publicly available data repositories of optical sensors such as Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and several commercial satellites. Studies that are heavily dependent on optical sensors are subject to data loss due to cloud coverage. Specifically, cloud contamination is a hindrance to long-term environmental assessment when using information from satellite imagery retrieved from visible and infrared spectral ranges. Landsat has an ongoing high-resolution NDVI record starting from 1984. Unfortunately, this long time series NDVI data suffers from the cloud contamination issue. Though both simple and complex computational methods for data interpolation have been applied to recover cloudy data, all the techniques have limitations. In this paper, a novel Optical Cloud Pixel Recovery (OCPR) method is proposed to repair cloudy pixels from the time-space-spectrum continuum using a Random Forest (RF) trained and tested with multi-parameter hydrologic data. The RF-based OCPR model is compared with a linear regression model to demonstrate the capability of OCPR. A case study in Apalachicola Bay is presented to evaluate the performance of OCPR to repair cloudy NDVI reflectance. The RF-based OCPR method achieves a root mean squared error of 0.016 between predicted and observed NDVI reflectance values. The linear regression model achieves a root mean squared error of 0.126. Our findings suggest that the RF-based OCPR method is effective to repair cloudy pixels and provides continuous and quantitatively reliable imagery for long-term environmental analysis. © 2017 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs9060527,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Based Crop Classification Using A Hybrid 3d-2d Cnn Model,"Reliable and accurate classification of crop types can greatly contribute to data sources in agricultural monitoring and food security. Remote sensing can be used to rapidly and accurately extract the planting areas and distribution of main crops, thereby optimizing the spatial pattern of crops, grain production, and management. However, it is extremely difficult to identify and then map different types of crops with high accuracy and efficiency, especially for traditional machine learning. The reason is that there are highly complex and heterogeneous spectral data in crop space on time-series remote sensing images. Fortunately, three-dimensional convolution neural networks (3D CNN) are suitable for the spatio-temporal information in the time-series remote sensing imagery. Nevertheless, the high complexity of the 3D CNN model often requires a large number of training samples. In this study, a novel hybrid classification model (called 3D-2D CNN) was proposed to integrate 3D CNN and two-dimensional convolution neural networks (2D CNN) in the trade-off among accuracy, efficiency, and ground sample acquisition. The specific procedure was as follows. The spatio-temporal features were first extracted from the multiple 3D convolutional layers, then the output features were compressed for the spatial feature analysis in the 2D convolutional layer, and finally the high-level maps of features were flattened to predict the category in the fully connected layer. Batch normalization was performed on the input data of each layer to accelerate the network convergence. As such, the complex structure of the original 3D CNN was reduced, while the capacity of 3D-2D CNN remained in spatio-temporal feature extraction. Taking northern California, USA, as the study area, Landsat8 multi-temporal images were utilized as the remote sensing data source in the test to verify the model. Landsat images presented specific characteristics, compared with the natural. The spectral and texture features of the same type varied greatly along with the imaging time and conditions. California agricultural investigation was used as sampling data. Accordingly, the land plots in the study area were randomly divided into a training, validation, and test region, according to 2:2:6 stratification, where the training and validation sample datasets were randomly selected. Since the overflow easily occurred, when the training dataset was limited in actual work, it was necessary for the deep learning model to require a large number of data samples to train a CNN. Correspondingly, two small sample sets of different proportions were randomly selected from the training sample set of 50% and 25% to verify the feasibility of the model. The trained models were then used to predict the test region. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy (89.38%), macro-average F1 value (84.21%), and Kappa coefficient (0.881) of 3D-2D CNN for 13 crop classifications performed better than other deep learning, including 3D CNN and 2D CNN, as well as traditional machine learning, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). It should be mentioned that the proposed 3D-2D CNN also achieved the best performance in the small training set, where the highest recognition rate of classification was obtained, compared with the benchmark models. Meanwhile, the convergence time of 3D-2D CNN was reduced greatly, compared with the 3D CNN, thanks to a significant reduction of parameters. It was found that there was a greater effect of temporal features of crops that were hidden in multi-temporal remote sensing imagery on CNN classification, compared with texture features. Consequently, the highest accuracy and strongest robustness were obtained in the 3D-2D CNN model, due mainly to the comprehensive utilization of spatial-temporal-spectrum features. The finding can provide a highly effective and novel solution to crop classification from multi-temporal remote sensing. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Web Tools Concerning Performance Analysis And Planning Support For Solar Energy Plants Starting From Remotely Sensed Optical Images,"We present innovative web tools, developed also in the frame of the FP7 ENDORSE (ENergy DOwnstReam SErvices) project, for the performance analysis and the support in planning of solar energy plants (PV, CSP, CPV). These services are based on the combination between the detailed physical model of each part of the plants and the near real-time satellite remote sensing of incident solar irradiance. Starting from the solar Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data provided by the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (GMES-MACC) Core Service and based on the elaboration of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite optical imagery, the Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) or the Beam Normal Irradiance (BNI) incident on plant's solar PV panels (or solar receivers for CSP or CPV) is calculated. Combining these parameters with the model of the solar power plant using also air temperature values, we can assess in near-real-time the daily evolution of the alternate current (AC) power produced by the plant. We are therefore able to compare this satellite-based AC power yield with the actually measured one and, consequently, to readily detect any possible malfunctions and to evaluate the performances of the plant (so-called ""Controller"" service). Besides, the same method can be applied to satellite-based averaged environmental data (solar irradiance and air temperature) in order to provide a Return on Investment analysis in support to the planning of new solar energy plants (so-called ""Planner"" service). This method has been successfully applied to three test solar plants (in North, Centre and South Italy respectively) and it has been validated by comparing satellite-based and in-situ measured hourly AC power data for several months in 2013 and 2014. The results show a good accuracy: the overall Normalized Bias (NB) is -0.41\%, the overall Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) is 4.90\%, the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) is 7.66\% and the overall Correlation Coefficient (CC) is 0.9538. The maximum value of the Normalized Absolute Error (NAB) is about 30\% and occurs for time periods with highly variable meteorological conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Application Of Geo-Cropsim Framework For Rainfed Sugarcane Yield Assessment In Thailand,"The adoption of hybrid approaches that use remote sensing datasets in crop simulation models for yield assessment at spatial scale has been constrained by lack of crop type maps and high-resolution remote sensing datasets. To address that, Geo-CropSim, a geospatial crop simulation modeling framework, was developed to produce high quality remote sensing products and use them in Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to estimate crop yields at various spatial scales. In this study, Geo-CropSim was implemented within the Chaiyaphum province, Thailand to estimate sugarcane yields under rainfed conditions for the 2018 at 500-m resolution. Results showed that the use of Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) data along with sentinel-1 SAR data allowed to produce a land cover map with an overall accuracy of 96%. Similarly, utilization of HLS data helped to estimate emergence dates and seasonal leaf area index capturing spatial differences driven by differences in climatic conditions. Geo-CropSim yield estimates ranged from 55-98 Mg/ha and showed a typical north-south gradient of decreased yields reflecting lower rainfall and soil quality in the south. Simulated yields showed good a correlation with district and field observed yields with RMSE values of 11.7 Mg/ha and 15.75 Mg/ha, respectively. Overall, simulated yields had uncertainty indicated by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), less than 20% which is considered as acceptable accuracy for regional yield assessment. Even though it is required to test the framework's performance for long-term consistency over multiple regions, this study demonstrated Geo-CropSim's potential to produce sugarcane yields under rainfed conditions with reasonable accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Segmentation Scale Parameter Influence On The Accuracy Of Detecting Illegal Landfills On Satellite Imagery. A Case Study For Novo Sarajevo,"Illegal waste dumping has been widely regarded as one of the biggest source of environmental damage. Illegal landfills are a prevailing problem existing in a large number of countries. To control and better manage illegal landfills, it is necessary to know the current locations and contents of illegal landfills. This could increase efficiency in illegal landfill management and preserve the biodiversity and ecological balance. Remote sensing methods have been proven extremely effective in detecting potential illegal landfill sites. This paper investigates the relationship between the segmentation scale parameter and the detection accuracy of illegal landfill sites in urban areas that are not covered by vegetation or buried in the ground. The research showed that there is an optimal scale parameter (SP = 20) value for the used satellite image Pleiades 1B and area of interest (Novo Sarajevo municipality).

Mission And System Architecture For An Operational Network Of Earth Observation Satellite Nodes,"Nowadays, constellations and distributed networks of satellites are emerging as clear development trends in the space system market to enable augmentation, enhancement, and possibilities of new applications for future Earth Observation (EO) missions. While the adoption of these satellite architectures is gaining momentum for the attaining of ever more stringent application requirements and stakeholder needs, the efforts to analyze their benefits and suitability, and to assess their impact for future programmes remains as an open challenge to the EO community. In this context, this paper presents the mission and system architecture conceived during the Horizon 2020 ONION project, a European Union research activity that proposes a systematic approach to the optimization of EO space infrastructures. In particular, ONION addressed the design of complementary assets that progressively supplement current programs and took part in the exploration of needs and implementation of architectures for the Copernicus Space Component for EO. Among several use cases considered, the ONION project focused on proposing system architectures to provide improved revisit time, data latency and image resolution for a demanding application scenario of interest: Marine Weather Forecast (MWF). A set of promising system architectures has been subject of a comprehensive assessment, based on mission analysis expertise and detailed simulation for evaluating several key parameters such as revisit time and data latency of each measurement of interest, on-board memory evolution and power budget of each satellite of the constellation, ground station contacts and inter-satellite links. The architectures are built with several heterogeneous satellite nodes distributed in different orbital planes. Each platform can embark different instrument sets, which provide the required measurements for each use case. A detailed mission analysis has then been performed to the selected architecture for the MWF use case, including a refined data flow analysis to optimize system resources; a refined power budget analysis; a delta-V and a fuel budget analysis considering all the possible phases of the mission. This includes from the correction of launcher injection errors and acquisition of nominal satellite position inside the constellation, orbit maintenance to control altitude, collision avoidance to avoid collision with space debris objects and end-of-life (EOL) disposal to comply with EOL guidelines. The relevance of the system architecture selected for the MWF has been evaluated for three use cases of interest (Arctic sea-ice monitoring, maritime fishery pressure and aquaculture, agricultural hydric stress) to show the versatility and the feasibility of the chosen architecture to be adapted for other EO applications.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.06.039,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Smart, Remote, And Targeted Health Care Facilitation Through Connected Health: Qualitative Study","Background: Societies around the world are aging. Widespread aging creates problems for social services and health care practices. In this light, research on connected health (CH) is becoming essential. CH refers to a variety of technological measures that allow health care to be provided remotely with the aim of increasing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and satisfaction on the part of health care recipients. CH is reshaping health care's direction to be more proactive, more preventive, and more precisely targeted and, thus, more effective. CH has been demonstrated to have great value in managing and preventing chronic diseases, which create huge burdens on health care and social services. In short, CH provides promising solutions to diseases and social challenges associated with aging populations. However, there are many barriers that need to be overcome before CH can be successfully and widely implemented. Objective: The research question of this study is as follows: How can CH facilitate smart, remote, and targeted health care? The objective is to identify how health care can be managed in more comprehensive ways, such as by providing timely, flexible, accessible, and personalized services to preserve continuity and offer high-quality seamless health care. Methods: A qualitative approach was used based on 60 multistage, semistructured stakeholder interviews. Results: The results can be divided into two functions of CH: Ecosystem and platform. On the one hand, the interviews enabled the authors to develop a stakeholder classification and interaction diagram. These stakeholders interacted sequentially to provide technology-based content to end users. On the other hand, interviewees reflected on how CH serves as a platform to address remote monitoring and patient self-management. In the Discussion section, three innovation strategies are discussed to reflect the manner in which CH promotes smart, timely, and precise health care. Conclusions: This study indicates that it is essential to continually revise CH business models, given the ongoing and rapid changes in technology across groups of CH stakeholders. We also found that global trends toward smart, timely, and precise health care shape what individuals expect from products and services, providing firms with unique opportunities for growth. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Ecosystem Services Provided By Waterbirds,"Ecosystem services are ecosystem processes that directly or indirectly benefit human well-being. There has been much recent literature identifying different services and the communities and species that provide them. This is a vital first step towards management and maintenance of these services. In this review, we specifically address the waterbirds, which play key functional roles in many aquatic ecosystems, including as predators, herbivores and vectors of seeds, invertebrates and nutrients, although these roles have often been overlooked. Waterbirds can maintain the diversity of other organisms, control pests, be effective bioindicators of ecological conditions, and act as sentinels of potential disease outbreaks. They also provide important provisioning (meat, feathers, eggs, etc.) and cultural services to both indigenous and westernized societies. We identify key gaps in the understanding of ecosystem services provided by waterbirds and areas for future research required to clarify their functional role in ecosystems and the services they provide. We consider how the economic value of these services could be calculated, giving some examples. Such valuation will provide powerful arguments for waterbird conservation. © 2013 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",NA,NA,10.1111/brv.12045,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Multi-Source Data Fusion Of Optical Satellite Imagery To Characterize Habitat Selection From Wildlife Tracking Data,"Wildlife tracking data allow monitoring of how organisms respond to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Remote sensing data can be used to quantify and qualify these variations to understand how movement is related to these changes. The use of remote sensing data with concurrent high levels of spatial and temporal detail may hold potential to improve our understanding of habitat selection. However, no current orbital sensor produces data with simultaneous high temporal and high spatial resolution, therefore alternative methods are required to generate remote sensing data that matches the high spatial-temporal resolution of modern wildlife tracking data. We present an analytical framework, not yet used in movement ecology, for data fusion of optical remote sensing data from multiple satellites and wildlife tracking data to study the impact of seasonal vegetation patterns on the movement of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus). We use multi-source data fusion to combine MODIS data with higher spatial resolution data (ASTER, Landsat 4–5–7-8, CBERS 2-2B) and create a synthetic NDVI product with a 15 m spatial detail and daily temporal resolution. We also use the higher spatial resolution data to create a multi-source NDVI product with same level of spatial detail but coarser temporal resolution and data from MODIS to create a single-source NDVI product with high temporal resolution but coarse spatial resolution. We combine the three different spatial-temporal resolution NDVI products with GPS tracking data of maned wolves to create step-selection functions (SSF), which are models used in ecology to investigate and predict habitat selection by animals. The SSF model based on multi-source NDVI had the best performance predicting the probability of use of visited locations given its NDVI value. The SSF based on the raw MODIS NDVI product, one which is commonly employed by ecologists, had the poorest performance for our study species. These findings indicate that, in contrast with current practice in movement ecology, a detailed spatial resolution of contextual environmental variable may be more important than a detailed temporal resolution, when investigating wildlife habitat selection regarding vegetation, although this result will be highly dependent on species. The choice of data set should therefore take into account not only the scale of movement but also the spatial and temporal scales at which dynamic environmental variables are changing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101149,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Design Coverage Optimization Based On Position Of Constellations And Cost Of The Launch Vehicle,"This research will analyze the tradeoffs between coverage optimization based on Position dilution of precision (PDOP) and cost of the launch vehicle. It adopts MATLAB and STK tools along with multiple objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) to explore the trade space for the constellation designs at different orbital altitudes. The objective of optimal design solutions is inferred to determine the economic and efficient LEO, MEO, HEO or hybrid constellations and simulation results are presented to optimize the design of satellite constellations. The benefits of this research are the optimization of satellite constellation design, which reduces costs and increases regional and global coverage with the least number of satellites. The result of this project is the optimization of the number of constellation satellites in several orbital planes in LEO orbit. Validations are based on reviewing the results of several simulations. The results of graphs and tables are presented in the last two sections and are taken from the results of several simulations. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Comparison Of Methods For Filling Daily And Monthly Rainfall Missing Data: Statistical Models Or Imputation Of Satellite Retrievals?,"Accurate estimation of precipitation patterns is essential for the modeling of hydrological systems and for the planning and management of water resources. However, rainfall time series, as obtained from traditional rain gauges, are frequently corrupted by missing values that might hinder frequency analysis, hydrological and environmental modeling, and meteorological drought monitoring. In this paper, we evaluated three techniques for filling missing values at daily and monthly time scales, namely, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and the direct imputation of satellite retrievals from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, in rainfall gauging stations located in the Brazilian midwestern region. Our results indicated that, despite the relatively low predictive skills of the models at the daily scale, the satellite retrievals provided moderately more accurate estimates, with better representations of the temporal dynamics of the dry and wet states and of the largest observed rainfall events in most testing sites in comparison to the statistical models. At the monthly scale, the performance of the three methods was similar, but the regression-based models were unable to reproduce the seasonal characteristics of the precipitation records, which, at least to some extent, were circumvented by the satellite products. As such, the satellite retrievals might comprise a useful alternative for dealing with missing values in rainfall time series, especially in those regions with complex spatial precipitation patterns.",NA,NA,10.3390/w14193144,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Urban Impervious Surface Automatic Threshold Detection Model Derived From Multitemporal Landsat Images,"Accurate mapping urban impervious surfaces (UIS) from satellite images is crucial for understanding urban land cover change directions and addressing UIS change-induced environmental issues. The UIS index is an effective way to reduce the computational cost of processing remote sensing imageries although continuous UIS detection from multitemporal Landsat images, repeated fine-tuning, and reselection for a proper threshold should be considered. In this article, we proposed a novel UIS index and an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based UIS automatic threshold selection model (UISAT) to overcome those shortages when detecting UIS derived from multitemporal Landsat images. The proposed UIS index transformed different temporal Landsat images into index images with distinguishable pixel values for each gray pixel. In this way, the pixel gray values representing UIS were enhanced, and non-UIS was weakened with lower gray scales in the transformed index images. Next, an automatic threshold selection strategy was developed to enhance the applicability of the PSO model in terms of threshold fine-tuning and reselection. Then, we performed comprehensive assessments for the UISAT model, including in comparison to an improved convolutional deep belief network for relative accuracy verification, random points matching with Google Earth images, and comparing to other typical indices. The results demonstrated that the UISAT model provided the best performance in UIS detection from multitemporal Landsat images. The producer's accuracies (PAs) of UISAT results in Beijing, Hefei, and Guangzhou, China, were 91.73\%, 93.87\%, and 92.84\%, while the user's accuracies (UA) were at 91.51\%, 93.35\%, and 92.24\%. The proposed model outperformed the existing commonly used UIS indices {[}e.g., the Biophysical Composition Index (BCI), the Combinational Build-up Index (CBI), the Genetic Algorithm-based Urban Cluster Automatic Threshold (GA-UCAT), and the Gaussian-based Automatic Threshold Modified Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (G-MNDISI)] by an average increase of 6.51\% in overall accuracy.",NA,NA,10.1109/tgrs.2021.3089581,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Swin Transformer And Deep Convolutional Neural Networks For Coastal Wetland Classification Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, And Lidar Data","The use of machine learning algorithms to classify complex landscapes has been revolution-ized by the introduction of deep learning techniques, particularly in remote sensing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in the classification of complex high-dimensional remote sensing imagery, specifically in wetland classification. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) algorithms are transformers. Although the transformers have been studied for a few remote sensing applications, the integration of deep CNNs and transformers has not been studied, particularly in wetland mapping. As such, in this study, we explore the potential and possible limitations to be overcome regarding the use of a multi-model deep learning network with the integration of a modified version of the well-known deep CNN network of VGG-16, a 3D CNN network, and Swin transformer for complex coastal wetland classification. Moreover, we discuss the potential and limitation of the proposed multi-model technique over several solo models, including a random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), VGG-16, 3D CNN, and Swin transformer in the pilot site of Saint John city located in New Brunswick, Canada. In terms of F-1 score, the multi-model network obtained values of 0.87, 0.88, 0.89, 0.91, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93 for the recognition of shrub wetland, fen, bog, aquatic bed, coastal marsh, forested wetland, and freshwater marsh, respectively. The results suggest that the multi-model network is superior to other solo classifiers from 3.36% to 33.35% in terms of average accuracy. Results achieved in this study suggest the high potential for integrating and using CNN networks with the cutting-edge transformers for the classification of complex landscapes in remote sensing. © 2022 by the authors.

Seabird Surveillance: Combining Cctv And Artificial Intelligence For Monitoring And Research,"Ecological research and monitoring need to be able to rapidly convey information that can form the basis of scientifically sound management. Automated sensor systems, especially if combined with artificial intelligence, can contribute to such rapid high-resolution data retrieval. Here, we explore the prospects of automated methods to generate insights for seabirds, which are often monitored for their high conservation value and for being sentinels for marine ecosystem changes. We have developed a system of video surveillance combined with automated image processing, which we apply to common murres Uria aalge. The system uses a deep learning algorithm for object detection (YOLOv5) that has been trained on annotated images of adult birds, chicks and eggs, and outputs time, location, size and confidence level of all detections, frame-by-frame, in the supplied video material. A total of 144 million bird detections were generated from a breeding cliff over three complete breeding seasons (2019–2021). We demonstrate how object detection can be used to accurately monitor breeding phenology and chick growth. Our automated monitoring approach can also identify and quantify rare events that are easily missed in traditional monitoring, such as disturbances from predators. Further, combining automated video analysis with continuous measurements from a temperature logger allows us to study impacts of heat waves on nest attendance in high detail. Our automated system thus produces comparable, and in several cases significantly more detailed, data than those generated from observational field studies. By running in real time on the camera streams, it has the potential to supply researchers and managers with high-resolution up-to-date information on seabird population status. We describe how the system can be modified to fit various types of ecological research and monitoring goals and thereby provide up-to-date support for conservation and ecosystem management. © 2023 The Authors.

Hsv Color-Space-Based Automated Object Localization For Robot Grasping Without Prior Knowledge,"We propose a simple and robust HSV color-space-based algorithm that can automatically extract object position information without human intervention or prior knowledge. In manufacturing sites with high variability, it is difficult to recognize products through robot machine vision, especially in terms of extracting object information accurately, owing to various environmental factors such as the noise around objects, shadows, light reflections, and illumination interferences. The proposed algorithm, which does not require users to reset the HSV color threshold value whenever a product is changed, uses ROI referencing method to solve this problem. The algorithm automatically identifies the object's location by using the HSV color-space-based ROI random sampling, ROI similarity comparison, and ROI merging. The proposed system utilizes an IoT device with several modules for the detection, analysis, control, and management of object data. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very useful for industrial automation applications under complex and highly variable manufacturing environments.",NA,NA,10.3390/app11167593,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Surrogated-Assisted Multimodal Multi-Objective Optimization For Hybrid Renewable Energy System,"Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is an effective tool to improve the utilization of renewable energy so as to enhance the quality of energy supply. The optimization of HRES includes a simulation process during a long time span, which is time-consuming. So far, introducing a surrogate model to replace the objective evaluation is an effective way to solve such problems. However, existing methods focused few on the diversity of solutions in the decision space. Based on this motivation, we proposed a novel surrogated-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that focuses on solving multimodal and time-expensive problems, termed SaMMEA. Specifically, we use a Gaussian process model to replace the calculation of the objective values. In addition, a special environmental selection strategy is proposed to enhance the diversity of solutions in the decision space and a model management method is proposed to better train the surrogate model. The proposed algorithm is then compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on HRES problems, which indicates that the proposed algorithm is competitive.",NA,NA,10.1007/s40747-022-00943-y,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Collection, Standardization And Attribution Of Robust Disaster Event Information-A Demonstrator Of A National Event-Based Loss And Damage Database In Austria","Loss and damage databases are essential tools within the disaster risk management cycle for making informed decisions. However, even in data-rich countries such as Austria, no consistent and curated multi-hazard database is available. Based on the requirements of the United Nations, the European Union, as well as on national demands to deal with disaster impacts, we conceived and set up a demonstrator for a consistent multi-hazard national event-based loss and damage database that addresses event identification, loss accounting and disaster forensics according to international standards. We built our database on already existing data from administration and federal agencies and formulated a process to combine those data in a synergetic way. Furthermore, we tested how earth observation and weather data could help to derive more robust disaster event information. Our demonstrator focuses on two Austrian federal provinces, three hazard types-floods, storms and mass movements-and the period between 2005 and 2018. By analyzing over 140.000 single event descriptions, we conclude that-despite some limitations in retrospective data harmonization-the implementation of a curated event-based national loss and damage database is feasible and adds significant value compared to the usage of single national datasets or existing international databases such as EM-DAT or the Risk Data Hub. With our demonstrator, we are able to support the national risk assessment, the national Sendai Monitoring and federal disaster risk management with the provision of best possible harmonized loss and damage information, tailored indicators and statistics as well as hazard impact maps on the municipality scale.",NA,NA,10.3390/geosciences12080283,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Mapping Of Soil Total Nitrogen Content In The Middle Reaches Of The Heihe River Basin In China Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing-Derived Variables,"Soil total nitrogen (STN) is an important indicator of soil quality and plays a key role in global nitrogen cycling. Accurate prediction of STN content is essential for the sustainable use of soil resources. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a promising source of data for soil monitoring because of its all-weather, all-day monitoring, but it has rarely been used for STN mapping. In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to predict STN by evaluating and comparing the performance of boosted regression trees (BRTs), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models in STN mapping in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. Fifteen predictor variables were used to construct models, including land use/land cover, multi-source remote sensing-derived variables, and topographic and climatic variables. We evaluated the prediction accuracy of the models based on a cross-validation procedure. Results showed that tree-based models (RF and BRT) outperformed SVM. Compared to the model that only used optical data, the addition of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data using the BRT method improved the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.2% and 17.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of all predictor variables using the BRT model had the best predictive performance, explaining 57% of the variation in STN, with the highest R2 (0.57) value and the lowest RMSE (0.24) and MAE (0.18) values. Remote sensing variables were the most important environmental variables for STN mapping, with 59% and 50% relative importance in the RF and BRT models, respectively. Our results show the potential of using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to predict STN, broadening the data source for future digital soil mapping. In addition, we propose that the SVM, RF, and BRT models should be calibrated and evaluated to obtain the best results for STN content mapping in similar landscapes. © 2019 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11242934,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Evaluation And Comparison Of Eight Machine Learning Models In Land Use/Land Cover Mapping Using Landsat 8 Oli: A Case Study Of The Northern Region Of Iran,"Land use land cover change mapping has been used for monitoring environmental changes as an essential factor to study on the earth's surface land cover in the field of climate change phenomena such as floods and droughts. Remote sensing images have been suggested to present inexpensive and fine-scale data offering multi-temporal coverage. This tool is useful in the field of environmental monitoring, land-cover mapping, and urban planning. This study aims to evaluate eight machine learning algorithms for image classification implemented in WEKA and R programming language. Firstly, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Level-2 images based on eight machine learning techniques including Random Forest, Decision Table, DTNB, J48, Lazy IBK, Multilayer Perceptron, Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NN ge), and Simple Logistic are classified. Then, obtained results are compared in term of Overall Accuracy (OA), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for land use land cover mapping. Among the eight machine learning algorithms used for image classification based on the training and test dataset, NN ge classifier is ranked first with values of 100, 0, and 0 for Overall Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error respectively. All machine learning algorithms had an Overall Accuracy of more than 99\% for the training dataset.

"Understanding The Adoption Of Digital Terrestrial, Cable-Based, And Satellite-Based Television To Speed Up The Analogue Switch-Off In Indonesia","This study attempts to provide policy recommendations to drive viewers' adoption of the digital terrestrial television (DTT), cable-based pay TV, and satellite-based pay TV by understanding the factors underlying the decision of each adoption. Primary data were collected during September and October 2019 through face-to-face structured interviews, yielding 762 valid responses. By utilising the standard neoclassical utility maximization framework and binary logistic regressions, the results show that family income is a relevant predictor for the diffusion of DTT and cable based pay TV, but not for the satellite-based. Instead, educational attainment plays an important role in explaining the adoption of satellite-based pay TV. Being an online video consumer is the only factor associated with the three services. Furthermore, this study reveals that awareness of DTT can stimulate its adoption. Meanwhile, the insignificant of television media use variables in the three models can be attributed to the absence of the relevant contents broadcasted on the television, indicating underutilisation of the television to communicate information about new innovation. These varied findings may indicate that each television service is in a diffusion phase that is different from one another. Finally, policy recommendations are proposed, highlighting the need for different approaches to drive each television service adoption.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.tele.2021.101633,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Comparative Analysis Of Opportunities In The Application Of The Factor Land In The State Of Goiás,"Uncertainty on income in agriculture is a common item due to the high opportunity costs of the factor land. Current research compared investment in land for the production of soybean in selected municipalities in the state of Goiás, Brazil, with other investment opportunities in capital markets. Results ranked the selected regions by order of accumulated income in land investment for the production of soybeans and evidenced that the municipalities investment provided more income that alternative investments. This fact presented discussions on the rationality of land investment for agricultural production. Results revealed that rural properties of the nine municipalities under analysis had an increase in their market value above inflation rates, measured by IGP-DI. The municipalities of Jataí and Mineiros were highlighted due to great valorization, whilst Goiatuba, Rio Verde and Santa Helena de Goiás had the lowest evolution rate, and thus investments with low income than other financial alternatives. © 2020 University Center of Maringa.

A Case Report Assessing The Utility Of A Low-Cost Tracking Gps Device For Monitoring Terrestrial Mammal Movements,"Background: Accurate data on animal movements can highlight behavioural and ecological issues, such as territorial interactions, barriers to migration patterns, including compromised movement corridors, or avoidance of deteriorating habitats, and disease transmission, thus helping in conservation decision making. This study examines the utility of mOOvement global positioning system (GPS) tags, a low-cost cattle ear tag tracking device to monitor movements of terrestrial mammal populations in South Australia. Results: Stationary tags (n = 40) were used to test horizontal accuracy with a median location error of 33.26 m (IQR = 16.9–59.4), and maximum recorded error of 410 m. The locational accuracy was weakly influenced by the horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), a measure of satellite availability and geometry, and overhead canopy cover. Numerous tags produced infrequent and inconsistent readings, median of 12 records per day (IQR = 6–12), correlating negatively with the tag’s distance from the centrally located LoRa antenna; however, some tags recorded fewer than one position per day. Conclusions: We propose that the primary cause of mOOvement tag inadequacy is the use of only the GPS satellite constellation (USA, 1978), which does not provide adequate coverage in either satellite number or geometry in the sky at the − 35° latitude to calculate accurate positions regularly over 24 h, unlike the multiple constellations available in the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). We conclude that GPS tags are unsuitable for studies requiring high locational accuracy or identification of an individual’s social interactions, where the GPS constellation has a limited number of satellites available during prolonged periods. They can, however, be used to provide estimates of home range size or track large scale daily movements of animals in more equatorially located regions. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1186/s40317-023-00347-w,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Lessons From A Global Remote Sensing Mapping Project. A Review Of The Impact Of The Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project For Science And Management,"Anthropogenic and natural impacts threaten the sustainability of ecosystem services provided by the ocean and its coastlines. Coral reefs are an endangered and important component of the tropical realm. Coral reef science, management and conservation programs greatly benefit from habitat maps when they are available. This study reviews the use of the Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project (MCRMP), which hierarchically mapped since 2004 coral reefs worldwide using Landsat satellite multispectral imagery at 30 m spatial resolution. Tracking in the scientific literature the impact of MCRMP products proved to be difficult because of frequent lack of citations (omission errors) and confusion with products that have integrated MCRMP data but degraded them (commission errors). To categorize the applications, we selected 62 representative studies that unambiguously used MCRMP products. MCRMP products were used prominently to achieve new results in coral reef inventories; conservation planning; enhancement of biodiversity and fishery resource mapping, monitoring and modeling; connectivity and climate change modeling. The products were also useful to map other ecosystems. We evaluate the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to MCRMP products. From this review, we also make recommendations and reflect more generally on the value of future global-scale mapping projects targeting specific ecosystems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying The Value Of An Ehealth Intervention Aimed At Cognitive Impairments: Observational Study In Different Contexts And Service Models,"Background: Value is one of the central concepts in health care, but it is vague within the field of summative eHealth evaluations. Moreover, the role of context in explaining the value is underexplored, and there is no explicit framework guiding the evaluation of the value of eHealth interventions. Hence, different studies conceptualize and operationalize value in different ways, ranging from measuring outcomes such as clinical efficacy or behavior change of patients or professionals to measuring the perceptions of various stakeholders or in economic terms. Objective: The objective of our study is to identify contextual factors that determine similarities and differences in the value of an eHealth intervention between two contexts. We also aim to reflect on and contribute to the discussion about the specification, assessment, and relativity of the “value” concept in the evaluation of eHealth interventions. Methods: The study concerned a 6-month eHealth intervention targeted at elderly patients (n=107) diagnosed with cognitive impairment in Italy and Sweden. The intervention introduced a case manager role and an eHealth platform to provide remote monitoring and coaching services to the patients. A model for evaluating the value of eHealth interventions was designed as monetary and nonmonetary benefits and sacrifices, based on the value conceptualizations in eHealth and marketing literature. The data was collected using the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), the clock drawing test, and the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L). Semistructured interviews were conducted with patients and health care professionals. Monetary data was collected from the health care and technology providers. Results: The value of an eHealth intervention applied to similar types of populations but differed in different contexts. In Sweden, patients improved cognitive performance (MMSE mean 0.85, SD 1.62, P<.001), reduced anxiety (EQ-5D-5L mean 0.16, SD 0.54, P=.046), perceived their health better (EQ-5D-5L VAS scale mean 2.6, SD 9.7, P=.035), and both patients and health care professionals were satisfied with the care. However, the Swedish service model demonstrated an increased cost, higher workload for health care professionals, and the intervention was not cost-efficient. In Italy, the patients were satisfied with the care received, and the health care professionals felt empowered and had an acceptable workload. Moreover, the intervention was cost-effective. However, clinical efficacy and quality of life improvements have not been observed. We identified 6 factors that influence the value of eHealth intervention in a particular context: (1) service delivery design of the intervention (process of delivery), (2) organizational setup of the intervention (ie, organizational structure and professionals involved), (3) cost of different treatments, (4) hourly rates of staff for delivering the intervention, (5) lifestyle habits of the population (eg, how physically active they were in their daily life and if they were living alone or with family), and (6) local preferences on the quality of patient care. Conclusions: Value in the assessments of eHealth interventions need to be considered beyond economic terms, perceptions, or behavior changes. To obtain a holistic view of the value created, it needs to be operationalized into monetary and nonmonetary outcomes, categorizing these into benefits and sacrifices. ©Monika Jurkeviciute, Lex van Velsen, Henrik Eriksson, Svante Lifvergren, Pietro Davide Trimarchi, Ulla Andin, Johan Svensson.",NA,NA,10.2196/17720,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Big Data And Social Indicators: Actual Trends And New Perspectives,"Big Data are a top subject in international research articles and a vast debate is taking place on their actual capability of being used to complement or even substitute official statistics surveys and social indicators in particular. In this paper we analyse the metadata of the Scopus database of academic articles on Big Data and we show that most of the existing and intensively growing literature is focused on software and computational issues whilst articles that are specifically focused on statistical issues and on the procedures to build social indicators from Big Data are a much smaller share of this vast production. Nevertheless the works that focus on these topics show promising results because in developed countries Big Data seem to be a good information base to create reliable proxies of social indicators, whereas in developing countries their use (for instance using satellite images) may be a viable alternative to traditional surveys. However, Big Data based social indicators deeply suffer of a number of open issues that affect their actual use: they do not correspond to any sampling scheme and they are often representative of particular segments of the population; they generally are private process-produced data whose access by national statistical offices is rarely possible although the intrinsic value of the information contained in Big Data has a social importance that should be shared with the whole community; Big Data lack the socio-economic background on which social indicators have been founded and their help to policy makers in their decision process is a fully open point. Therefore Big Data may be a big opportunity for the definition of traditional or new social indicators but their statistical reliability should be further investigated and their availability and use should be internationally coordinated.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11205-016-1495-y,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"

"Use Of Remote Sensing Measurements To Evaluate Vehicle Emission Monitoring Programs: Results From Phoenix, Arizona","Vehicle emission inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs are the US EPA's primary policy to reduce on-road emissions of in-use vehicles. The EPA is preparing guidance for states on how to use on-road emissions measurements made by roadside sensors (remote sensing) to evaluate the effectiveness of their I/M programs. In its guidance EPA describes three methods of using remote sensing data for such evaluations: the comprehensive method, the step change method, and the reference method. We used an extensive number of remote sensing measurements in the Phoenix area to estimate program benefits under each method, in order to understand how each method measures emission reductions under an I/M program. The extensive number of measurements also allows testing the sensitivity of results obtained under the comprehensive method to the month in which the measurements were taken.We found that the comprehensive method estimates a small reduction in CO emissions (3.3 ± 0.6%) from the I/M program; however, the step change method estimates no program benefit. A reference method analysis comparing on-road emissions of fleets in an enhanced and a basic program indicates that older vehicles have higher on-road emissions under the enhanced program than the basic program.

Dsm-To-Lod2: Spaceborne Stereo Digital Surface Model Refinement,"A digital surface model (DSM) provides the geometry and structure of an urban environment with buildings being the most prominent objects in it. Built-up areas change with time due to the rapid expansion of cities. New buildings are being built, existing ones are expanded, and old buildings are torn down. As a result, 3D surface models can increase the understanding and explanation of complex urban scenarios. They are very useful in numerous fields of remote sensing applications, in tasks related to 3D reconstruction and city modeling, planning, visualization, disaster management, navigation, and decision-making, among others. DSMs are typically derived from various acquisition techniques, like photogrammetry, laser scanning, or synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The generation of DSMs from very high resolution optical stereo satellite imagery leads to high resolution DSMs which often suffer from mismatches, missing values, or blunders, resulting in coarse building shape representation. To overcome these problems, we propose a method for 3D surface model generation with refined building shapes to level of detail (LoD) 2 from stereo half-meter resolution satellite DSMs using deep learning techniques. Mainly, we train a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with an objective function based on least square residuals to generate an accurate LoD2-like DSM with enhanced 3D object shapes directly from the noisy stereo DSM input. In addition, to achieve close to LoD2 shapes of buildings, we introduce a new approach to generate an artificial DSM with accurate and realistic building geometries from city geography markup language (CityGML) data, on which we later perform a training of the proposed cGAN architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the strong potential to create large-scale remote sensing elevation models where the buildings exhibit better-quality shapes and roof forms than just using the matching process. Moreover, the developed model is successfully applied to a different city that is unseen during the training to show its generalization capacity.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs10121926,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Land Cover And Fire Accounts To Support Indigenous Land Management: A Pilot Study Of Yawuru Country,"Ecosystem accounting is emerging as a promising tool for environmental management by offering consistent information about ecosystem change over time. Via a United Nations process, ecosystem accounting has been standardised in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). However, there are currently no examples of ecosystem accounts developed specifically to support Indigenous people's management of land or sea. More than 40\% (3 million square kilometres) of Australia's land and sea territory has Indigenous Title. If Indigenous managers are to use ecosystem accounting, then it is essential for them to be involved in its development. We assessed how ecosystem accounts can be developed and applied in a manner that supports the management objectives of Indigenous owners and managers. Working collaboratively with the Yawuru Traditional Owners of the land and sea country around Broome, Western Australia, we constructed and assessed experimental ecosystem accounts for land cover and fire for the period 2000-2020. Three key benefits of ecosystem accounts for supporting the priorities of Yawuru managers were identified: (1) flexibility in the units used for the analysis; (2) the extended time scale of the accounts; and (3) the emphasis on consistent capturing and reporting of data. We also identified the need for further work to incorporate cultural knowledge and values within the broader SEEA, with implications for the recognition of Indigenous people, knowledge and values within accounting systems globally.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115003,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Applications Of Advanced Composites For Satellite Packaging For Improved Electronic Component Thermal Management,"Improved thermal management (TM) of electronics using advanced materials provides the potential to improve spacecraft electronics reliability with a resultant increase in the functional life of the spacecraft and cost savings to the user. Electronic packaging in this study includes the total heat transfer path in the spacecraft from the chip heat source to the heat rejection system, since it must be an integrated system. The cost effectiveness of all spacecraft material is increased when it is designed to fulfil multiple satellite functions including carrying structural loads, providing environmental protection for internal components, conducting electric current to minimize electrical charge buildup, providing electromagnetic shielding, as well as TM. The development of lighter weight multi-functional TM materials must flow from the satellite functional requirements down to the material design level, if possible. The composite materials must be designed to satisfy the maximum number of requirements. One essential property for satellite electronic TM applications is high specific thermal conductivity. The composite materials being considered consist of a combination of fibers, whiskers, and/or particles in a matrix. The two classes of composites that will be the primary focus of this paper are organic (or resin) matrix composites and metal matrix composites. This paper will address satellite systems/components that would significantly benefit from improved thermal management. It will identify candidate advanced materials, and present component design alternatives associated with the new materials and their potential performance improvement. It will summarize some of the key composite material property information associated with the materials used in the candidate applications and conclude with an assessment of the impact of the TM materials on the performance of a candidate component. © 1993.",NA,NA,10.1016/0094-5765(93)90057-4,excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Synergies Between Space And Energy: Space As A Tool To Support European Energy Goals,"The space and energy sector have similar sustainable ambitions and face similar technological difficulties, providing numerous occasions for learning, collaborating and creating economic and societal value. Adopting space technology and applications within the energy sector offers many high-potential opportunities worth exploring. Space can serve as an enabler for revolutionizing the energy sector by providing information on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency to facilitate the energy transition and support decision and policy-makers in developing, implementing, and monitoring various energy policy areas such as energy resource management and energy transport. Political interest in this topic is rising, and multiple high-level discussions took place in Europe in 2018 to gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and enablers for space as a tool to support European energy policy. This article draws on the insights from two dedicated events to highlight the most prominent opportunities and enablers. The outcomes of these events provide a source of inspiration for policy development, investment decisions, and R\&D proposals to further stimulate space as an enabler for sustainable economic growth in the energy sector.

Can A Supplier Benefit From Investing In Transaction-Specific Investments? A Multilevel Model Of The Value Co-Creation Ecosystem Perspective,"Purpose This paper aims to build and empirically test a multilevel framework integrating transaction cost economics and a resource-based view into a value co-creation ecosystem perspective to explain the chain- and firm-level effects of transaction-specific investments (TSIs) on supplier performance. Design/methodology/approach This paper investigates cross-level network effects using survey data from theList of Taiwanese Central Satellite Production Systems. A total of 34 buyers (hub firms) and 106 suppliers (satellite firms) from 34 supply chains responded to the survey. Findings Findings confirm that individual firms' TSIs can foster co-specificity at the supply chain level, thereby improving supply chain integration (SCI). SCI can have a positive cross-level moderating effect on the TSI-performance relationship. Research limitations/implications These two key concepts, value co-creation and co-specificity, extend the theoretical application of transaction cost theory and the resource-based view to cross-level study by contributing to the research on the TSI-performance relationship. Practical implications This study's framework is a counter to the buyer-supplier-supplier relationships in which each actor who may have different goals can create value jointly and share benefits from their TSIs. Social implications Owing to high co-specificity, being embedded in a well-integrated supply chain can be a threat when the environment is turbulent; for losing strategic flexibility, co-specificity and embeddedness may result in a collective adaptation concern. High degrees of SCI may slow the reaction to environmental turbulence for both buyers and suppliers. Originality/value Individual firms' TSIs can foster co-specificity at the supply chain level, subsequently enhancing SCI. An integrated supply chain can be a collective asset that facilitates value co-creation. Individual firms can benefit from the sharing of collective value. SCI can also increase switching costs, thus reducing the likelihood of individual firm engaging in opportunistic behavior and cost safeguarding.",NA,NA,10.1108/scm-09-2019-0347,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Integrating Remotely Sensed Imagery And Existing Multiscale Field Data To Derive Rangeland Indicators: Application Of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees,"Remotely sensed imagery at multiple spatial scales is used increasingly in conjunction with field data to estimate rangeland indicators (e.g., vegetation cover) and meet the growing need for landscape-scale monitoring and assessment of rangelands. Remote sensing studies that produce rangeland indicators often require intensive and costly field-data collection efforts to produce accurate model predictions. Existing monitoring data, such as those collected by the Bureau of Land Management's Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) program, are potentially useful sources of field data in remote sensing modeling studies. Given their data-hungry nature, common regression tree - based modeling approaches may be inadequate for reliably predicting rangeland indicators with the smaller sample sizes of AIM data than typically used for remote sensing studies. Current literature suggests that Bayesian models, such as Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), may provide a suitable alternative to traditional regression tree - based modeling approaches to overcome the sample size limitation of the AIM data. In this study, we used 182 AIM field plots together with both high (RapidEye) and moderate (Landsat OLI) spatial resolution satellite imagery to predict bare ground and bare soil, total foliar, herbaceous, woody, and shrub cover indicators on rangelands in a 14 625-km2 area of northeastern California. We demonstrate that a BART model performed similarly to other regression tree approaches when field data and high spatial resolution imagery predictions were combined to predict indicator values using the medium spatial resolution Landsat image. The BART models also provided spatially explicit uncertainty estimates, which allow land managers to more carefully evaluate indicator predictions and to identify areas where future field data collection might be most useful. This study demonstrates that existing field data and freely available, remotely sensed imagery can be integrated to produce spatially explicit and continuous surface estimates of rangeland indicators across entire landscapes. © Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rama.2017.02.004,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Research On High-Precision Radiation Calibration Technology Of Long-Wave Infrared Space Optical Remote Sensor,"In order to meet the needs of high-precision monitoring of surface temperature remote sensing in environmental protection, land, agriculture, meteorology, disaster reduction and other industries of our country, the spatial resolution of our country's long-wave infrared optical remote sensors has been increased from kilometer scale to ten-meter scale in recent years. The demand for quantitative applications is also increasing gradually. High-precision radiation calibration is the key to ensuring the quantitative application of infrared data. The detector of long wave infrared camera is limited by the chip material, chip preparation process, readout circuit design and production capacity and other reasons. Although the long wave infrared detector is constantly improving and developing, there are still some problems in varying degrees, such as large dark current, non-uniform response, low response and low temperature response, which directly affect the performance and radiometric calibration accuracy of long wave infrared camera.This article analyzes the factors that affect the accuracy of radiation calibration through the entire link. Combining with the specific development process of a certain model task, this article analyzes the optimization methods of the main influencing factors, including the optimization of the on-board calibration scheme, the improvement of temperature controlling accuracy and calibrating accuracy of the on-board blackbody calibration, the improvement of the performance of the long-wave detector and the improvement of the temperature controlling accuracy of the long-wave detector on the focal plane to improve the performance and output stability of the camera. The radiation calibration accuracy and the response state of system calibration has been verified through the vacuum radiation calibration test of this model. The test results show that the response slope of the radiometric calibration equation of the long wave infrared camera is effectively improved (from better than 45 of GF-5 01 satellite to better than 125 of GF-5 02 satellite), the output stability of the camera system is improved (DN value fluctuation is reduced from 20-30DN of GF-5 01 satellite to 1-2 DN of GF-5 02 satellite), and the accuracy of radiometric calibration is improved (from 1 K@300 K of GF-5 01 satellite decreased to 0.8 K@300 K of GF-5 01 satellite).It reaches a high level among the same type of domestic long-wave infrared space optical remote sensors with a spatial resolution of less than 100 m. The performance improvement method of long-wave infrared space optical remote sensor introduced in this article can provide reference for the development and radiation calibration of similar remote sensors in the future. The calibration test verification results provided in this article can also provide references for the in-orbit applications of similar infrared satellites. © 2021, Science Press.

An Optimal Remote Sensing Image Enhancement With Weak Detail Preservation In Wavelet Domain,"This paper presents a novel and simple algorithm that uses adaptive intensity transformation function for color multispectral satellite images. This intensity transformation provides a solution to increase the quality of satellite images by using power law operator in natural R, G, and B color model. Firstly, the proposed technique uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) that decomposes the input satellite image in higher and lower four sub band. Thereafter, it computes the optimized value of the operator in lower sub band (LL) of DWT. The optimal value of operator is evaluated using nature inspired optimization algorithm (NIA) and applied correction factor using SVD. Finally, the corrected LL sub band takes IDWT with other unprocessed sub band. We measure its performance by using contrast assessment function (CAF) which is based on the luminance, entropy and contrast for different satellite images. The proposed method gives better metric values than other comparative state of art methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1007/s12652-021-02957-9,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Extracting The Full Value Of The Landsat Archive: Inter-Sensor Harmonization For The Mapping Of Minnesota Forest Canopy Cover (1973–2015),"Remote sensing estimates of forest canopy cover have frequently been used to support a variety of applications including wildlife habitat modeling, monitoring of watershed health, change detection, and are also correlated to various aspects of forest structure and ecosystem function. Although data from the long running Landsat earth observation program (1972–present) have been previously utilized to characterize forest canopy cover, the variability in spatial and spectral resolutions between the Landsat sensors has generally limited analyses to readily comparable imagery from the TM and ETM+ sensors, which omits large portions of the full temporal record. In this study, we present an R package, LandsatLinkr, which automates the processes for harmonizing Landsat MSS and OLI imagery to the spatial and spectral qualities of TM and ETM+ imagery, allowing for the generation of annual cloud-free composites of tasseled cap spectral indices across the entire Landsat archive. We demonstrate the utility of LandsatLinkr products, further enhanced through the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm, for characterizing forest attributes through time by developing annual forest masks and maps of estimated canopy cover for the state of Minnesota from 1973 to 2015. The forest mask model had an overall accuracy of 87%, with omission and commission errors for the forest class of 17% and 10%, respectively, and 9% and 16% for non-forest classification. Our resulting maps depicted a significant positive trend in forest cover across all ecological provinces of Minnesota during the study period. A random forest model used to predict continuous canopy cover had a pseudo R2 of 0.75, with a cross validation RMSE of 5%. Our results are comparable to previous Landsat-based canopy cover mapping efforts, but expand the evaluation time period as we were able to utilize the entire Landsat archive for assessment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.046,excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Evaluation Of Different Classification Techniques For The Detection Of Glass And Plastic Greenhouses From Worldview-2 Satellite Imagery,"Greenhouse detection using remote sensing technologies is a challenging task for urban and rural planning, agricultural yield estimation, natural resource management, and sustainable development. The main objectives of this research are (1) to compare the supervised classification techniques including maximum likelihood (ML), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM) for land cover classification with emphasis on greenhouse detection and (2) to investigate the utility of WorldView-2 satellite imagery for detecting and discriminating plastic and glass greenhouses. The study was implemented in an area selected from Muratpasa district of Antalya, Turkey, which includes both glass and plastic greenhouses extensively. Overall, the computed classification accuracies are quite high using all classification techniques. However, the most accurate classification result was obtained using SVM classifier, with overall accuracy of 93.88\%. The performance of RF classification is slightly lower than SVM classification, with overall accuracy of 91.73\%. On the other hand, SVM and RF classifiers significantly outperformed ML classifier, providing higher overall accuracies. When plastic greenhouse detection accuracies are considered, the obtained results revealed that all of the used classification techniques are quite successful. However, for glass greenhouse detection, the SVM and RF classifiers provided significantly higher accuracies than ML.

A Bayesian Deep Image Prior Downscaling Approach For High-Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation,"Soil moisture (SM) estimation is a critical part of environmental and agricultural monitoring, with satellite-based microwave remote sensing being the main SM source. However, the limited spatial resolution of most current remote sensing SM products reduces their utility for many applications, such as evapotranspiration modeling and agriculture management. In this article, to address this issue, we propose a Bayesian deep image prior (BDIP) downscaling approach to estimate the high-resolution SM from satellite products. More specifically, the high-resolution SM estimation problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem, and solved via a neural network comprising of a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for modeling the prior spatial correlation distribution of the underlying high-resolution SM variables, and a forward model characterizing the SM map degeneration process for modeling the data likelihood. As such, the proposed BDIP approach provides a statistical framework that integrates deep learning with forward modeling in a coherent manner for combining different sources of information, i.e., the knowledge in the forward model, the spatial correlation prior in FCNN architecture, and the remote sensing data and products. Experiments on the downscaling of SM active passive SM products using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products show that SM maps estimated using the proposed method provide greater spatial detail information than other downscaling methods, with the SM estimates very close to in situ measurements.",NA,NA,10.1109/jstars.2022.3177081,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Bias Adjustment Of Satellite Rainfall Data Through Gaussian Process Regression (Gpr) Based On Rain Intensity Classification In The Greater Bay Area, China","Estimating precipitation over large spatial areas remains a challenging problem for hydrologists. Satellite-based remote sensing rainfall products have the advantage of large-scale synchronous coverage, but the reliability of their inversion still needs to be improved. Correcting the bias of satellite-based precipitation estimates (SPEs) is a major challenge in applications such as environmental modeling, hydrology, and water resource management. In this paper, a new bias correction method-a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model method based on rain intensity classification-is proposed to improve the accuracy of a satellite precipitation product-the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run (FR) product-at the daily scale in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. By comparing the effects of the proposed method with those of other existing classical correction methods, namely, quantile mapping (QM), the support vector machine (SVM) approach and direct GPR, it is found that all four methods improve the accuracy of the FR product to varying degrees. GPR based on rain intensity classification has the best effect of FR product improvement, with the CORR increasing from 0.55 to 0.59, the RMSE ranging from 14.37 to 12.79 mm/day, and the BIAS ranging from - 0.14 to 0.03 during the validation period. GPR without rain intensity classification also yields good results, with the QM and SVM methods being the least effective.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00704-023-04435-y,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Value Of Information Based Design Of Control Software,"This paper presents a suggested alternative to simplistic majority voting schemes based on the value of uncertain information. It uses satellite antennae deployment as an illustrative example. Control software is used in satellites to activate system functions like, e.g. antenna deployment. The software receives observations from sensors built into satellites and uses this information to trigger required functions. Often, inadvertent activation and delayed response can have severe consequences. Hence the way in which sensor information is processed strongly influences the system performance. We discuss an approach that models various 'design' options in detail so that the software control flow can be optimised via decision theory. We give some mathematical background and an example based on the CLUSTER satellite system that was spun off a design problem at European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC). Our example considers the decision of when to deploy a satellite antenna. The control software must decide when to inspect sensors and when to deploy the antenna. We show how to optimise both the inspection time and the time to deploy the antenna given the results of the inspection. For our example it is important that the consequences of the control software decisions are analysed and measured in monetary loss associated with failure. This allows us to measure the risk in expected loss of money. Given control software designs A and B one can compare them by obtaining the value of information. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Remote Sensing For Conservation Monitoring: Assessing Protected Areas, Habitat Extent, Habitat Condition, Species Diversity, And Threats","Monitoring protected areas and their surrounds at local to regional scales is essential given their vulnerability to anthropogenic pressures, including those associated with climatic fluctuation, and important for management and fulfilment of national and international directives and agreements. Whilst monitoring has commonly revolved around field data, remote sensing can play a key role in establishing baselines of the extent and condition of habitats and associated species diversity as well as quantifying losses, degradation or recovery associated with specific events or processes. Landsat images constitute a major data source for habitat monitoring, capturing broad scale information on changes in habitat extent and spatial patterns of fragmentation that allow disturbances in protected areas to be identified. These data are, however, less able to provide information on changes in habitat quality, species distribution and fine-scale disturbances, and hence data from other spaceborne optical sensors are increasingly being considered. Very High Resolution (VHR) optical datasets have been exploited to a lesser extent, partly because of the relative recency of spaceborne observations and challenges associated with obtaining and routinely extracting information from airborne multi-spectral and hyperspectral datasets. The lack of a shortwave infrared band in many VHR datasets and provision of too much detail (e.g., shadows within and from landscape objects) also present challenges in some cases. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly when used synergistically with optical data, have benefited the detection of changes in the three-dimensional structure of habitats. This review shows that remote sensing has a strong, yet underexploited potential to assist in the monitoring of protected areas. However, the data generated need to be utilized more effectively to enable better management of the condition of protected areas and their surrounds, prepare for climate change, and assist planning for future landscape management.

Load Monitoring Practice In European Elite Football And The Impact Of Club Culture And Financial Resources,"Load monitoring is considered important to manage the physical training process in team sports such as Association Football. Previous studies have described the load monitoring practices of elite English football clubs and clubs with an established sports-science department. An examination of a broader international sample is currently not available. In addition, previous research has suggested factors that may improve the implementation of load monitoring practices, such as a strong club belief on the benefit of evidence-based practice (EBP) and high club financial resources. However, no study has examined yet the actual impact of these factors on the monitoring practices. Therefore, this study aims (1) to provide an overview of load monitoring practices in European elite football and (2) to provide insight into the differences in implementation between clubs by examining the impact of the club beliefs on the benefit of EBP and the club financial resources. An online survey, consisting of multiple choice and Likert scale questions, was distributed among sports-science and sports-medicine staff (n = 99, 50\% response rate). Information was asked about the types of data collected, collection purposes, analysis methods, and staff involvement. The results indicated that external load data (e.g., global navigation satellite system, accelerometer horizontal ellipsis ) was collected the most whilst respondents also indicated to collect internal load (e.g., heart rate, rating of perceived exertion horizontal ellipsis ) and training outcome data (e.g., aerobic fitness, neuromuscular fatigue horizontal ellipsis ) for multiple purposes. Considerable diversity in data analysis was observed suggesting that analysis is often limited to reporting the gathered data. Sports-science staff were responsible for data collection and analysis. Other staff were involved in data discussion to share decision-making. These practices were positively impacted by a stronger club belief on the benefit of EBP and greater financial resources. Creating an organizational culture, characterized by a strong belief on the benefit of EBP, is important to increase the impact of load monitoring. However, the actual potential may still be largely determined by financial resources. High-level clubs could therefore play a leading role in generating and sharing knowledge to improve training practices and player health.",NA,NA,10.3389/fspor.2021.679824,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Aims: This study aimed to describe the early warning findings at the Hajj to highlight the pattern of health risks and the potential benefits of the disease surveillance system. Methods: Using syndromic surveillance and event-based surveillance data, the health early warning system generated automated alarms for public health events, triggered alerts for rapid epidemiological investigations and facilitated the monitoring of health events. Results: During the deployment period (4 July–31 August 2019), a total of 121 automated alarms were generated, of which 2 events (heat-related illnesses and injuries/trauma) were confirmed by the response teams. Conclusion: The surveillance system potentially improved the timeliness and situational awareness for health events, including non-infectious threats.

An Empirical Evaluation Of Private Landowner Participation In Voluntary Forest Conservation Programs,"The use of voluntary programs targeting resource conservation on private land has become increasingly prevalent in environmental policy. Voluntary programs potentially offer significant benefits over regulatory and market-based approaches.

A logistic regression model is applied to determine the probability of participation based on landowner education, membership in other non-forest voluntary programs, dominant land use activity, parcel size, distance from urban center, land resource portfolios, and forest cover. Both land use activity and the spatial configuration of a landholder's resource portfolio are found to be statistically significant with important implications for the design and implementation of voluntary programs.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00267-009-9327-3,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Overview: Spatial Information And Indicators For Sustainable Management Of Natural Resources,"Natural resource management (NRM) is becoming increasingly important at all scales, local, regional. national and global, because of an increasing human population and increasing per capita use of resources and space. Conflicts are intensifying between different interest groups. Production and conservation aspects are particularly debated because conservation often conflicts with economic and social sustainability. There is public demand for objective decision based NRM but limitations are all pervasive due to the spatial and temporal complexity and interdisciplinary nature. This special issue explores the use of spatial data and models to overcome some limitations of NRM decision making. The papers in this issue show modern approaches of natural resources management with a particular focus on spatial data collection, analysis and the development of spatial indicators. This issue presents a balanced mix of review and research papers that give examples of how to find or improve the spatial information base for evidence-based decision making. This overview makes the argument that understanding complex spatial pattern and processes, and the development of spatial indicators, is an essential aspect of evidence-based NRM. If spatial and temporal patterns are complex, ecological evidence from field data or experiments may have limited value for NRM and observational study designs become more appropriate for understanding complex spatial pattern and processes. Data quality should be documented as a combination of accuracy and spatio-temporal representativeness in order to be useful in the NRM decision process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Remote Sensing Products To Classify Landscape. A Multi-Spatial Resolution Approach,"The European Landscape Convention encourages the inventory and characterization of landscapes for environmental management and planning actions. Among the range of data sources available for landscape classification, remote sensing has substantial applicability, although difficulties might arise when available data are not at the spatial resolution of operational interest. We evaluated the applicability of two remote sensing products informing on land cover (the categorical CORINE map at 30 m resolution and the continuous NDVI spectral index at 1 km resolution) in landscape classification across a range of spatial resolutions (30m, 90m, 180m, 1 km), using the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain) as study case. Separate landscape classifications (using topography, urban influence and land cover as inputs) were accomplished, one per each land cover dataset and spatial resolution. Classification accuracy was estimated through confusion matrixes and uncertainty in terms of both membership probability and confusion indices. Regarding landscape classifications based on CORINE, both typology and number of landscape classes varied across spatial resolutions. Classification accuracy increased from 30 m (the original resolution of CORINE) to 90m, decreasing towards coarser resolutions. Uncertainty followed the opposite pattern. In the case of landscape classifications based on NDVI, the identified landscape patterns were geographically structured and showed little sensitivity to changes across spatial resolutions. Only the change from 1 km (the original resolution of NDVI) to 180 m improved classification accuracy. The value of confusion indices increased with resolution. We highlight the need for greater effort in selecting data sources at the suitable spatial resolution, matching regional peculiarities and minimizing error and uncertainty. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding And Benchmarking Health Service Achievement Of Policy Goals For Chronic Disease,"Background: Key challenges in benchmarking health service achievement of policy goals in areas such as chronic disease are: 1) developing indicators and understanding how policy goals might work as indicators of service performance; 2) developing methods for economically collecting and reporting stakeholder perceptions; 3) combining and sharing data about the performance of organizations; 4) interpreting outcome measures; 5) obtaining actionable benchmarking information. This study aimed to explore how a new Boolean-based small-N method from the social sciences-Qualitative Comparative Analysis or QCA-could contribute to meeting these internationally shared challenges. Methods: A 'multi-value QCA' (MVQCA) analysis was conducted of data from 24 senior staff at 17 randomly selected services for chronic disease, who provided perceptions of 1) whether government health services were improving their achievement of a set of statewide policy goals for chronic disease and 2) the efficacy of state health office actions in influencing this improvement. The analysis produced summaries of configurations of perceived service improvements. Results: Most respondents observed improvements in most areas but uniformly good improvements across services were not perceived as happening (regardless of whether respondents identified a state health office contribution to that improvement). The sentinel policy goal of using evidence to develop service practice was not achieved at all in four services and appears to be reliant on other kinds of service improvements happening. Conclusions: The QCA method suggested theoretically plausible findings and an approach that with further development could help meet the five benchmarking challenges. In particular, it suggests that achievement of one policy goal may be reliant on achievement of another goal in complex ways that the literature has not yet fully accommodated but which could help prioritize policy goals. The weaknesses of QCA can be found wherever traditional big-N statistical methods are needed and possible, and in its more complex and therefore difficult to empirically validate findings. It should be considered a potentially valuable adjunct method for benchmarking complex health policy goals such as those for chronic disease.",NA,NA,10.1186/1472-6963-12-343,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Estimation Of Land Surface Incident Shortwave Radiation From Geostationary Advanced Himawari Imager And Advanced Baseline Imager Observations Using An Optimization Method,"Surface incident shortwave radiation (ISR) is an important component of the surface radiation budget. We refined the optimization method developed for polar-orbiting satellite data {[}1] and applied it to estimate ISR from the new generation geostationary Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8/9 satellite and Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series. Validation of the AHI ISR estimation at 2-km resolution showed an R-2 of 0.93, bias of 0.52 W/m(2), and RMSE of 106.52 W/m(2) for instantaneous estimates; an R-2 of 0.95, bias of -0.12 W/m(2), and RMSE of 22.49 W/m(2) for daily mean ISR; and a bias of -0.18 W/m(2) and RMSE of 7.72 W/m(2) for monthly mean ISR. Validation of the ABI ISR at 2-km spatial resolution showed an R-2 value of 0.93, bias of 8.71W/m(2), and RMSE of 102.30 W/m(2) for instantaneous estimates; an R-2 of 0.95, bias of -2.38 W/m(2), and RMSE of 27.17 W/m(2) for daily mean ISR; and a bias of 1.40 W/m(2) and RMSE of 14.75 W/m(2) for monthly mean ISR. Our study also demonstrated that AHI and ABI observations have realized much better estimations for hourly and diurnal ISR than previous polar-orbiting satellite data because of their higher frequency of sampling on the atmospheric conditions.",NA,NA,10.1109/tgrs.2020.3038829,excluded,{Validation/calibration}

A High-Precision Water Body Extraction Method Based On Improved Lightweight U-Net,"The rapid, accurate extraction of water body information is critical for water resource management and disaster assessment. Its data foundation was mostly provided by remote sensing images through deep learning methods. However, the methods still require the improvement of recognition accuracy and reduction of model size. As a solution, this paper proposed a new high-precision convolutional neural network for water body extraction. This network's structural design is based on the assumption that the extraction effect of a convolutional neural network is independent from its parameters number, thus the recognition effect could be effectively improved through reasonable adjustment of the network structure according to characteristics of water bodies on high-resolution remote sensing images. It brings two critical improvements. Firstly, the number of downsampling layers was reduced to adapt to the low resolution of remote sensing imagery. Secondly, the bottleneck structure has also been updated to fit the decoder-encoder framework. The improved bottleneck structures were nested to ensure the transmission of water characteristics information in the model. In comparison with the other five commonly used networks, the new network has achieved the best results (average overall accuracy: 98.31\%, parameter benefit value: 0.2625), indicating the extremely high practical value of this approach.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14174127,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
How Health Relationship Management Services (Hrms) Benefits Corporate Wellness,"The typical worker spends about 47 hours a week commuting sitting in cars, trains, buses, or sitting at their desks. These statistics show that maintaining a healthy work and life balance has become progressively important. Workplace wellness and health promotion are of central importance for any organization in today's world. People are becoming highly conscious about their health and seek to ensure that they are provided with best medical services and facilities in case of any health issue. Organizations have switched to proactive strategies for the healthcare of their employees. Billions of dollars are spent on the workforce only after illnesses or injuries have occurred. Over the past several decades, healthcare services have drastically changed, altering the manner in which healthcare was previously managed. Technological advancements in medical systems have revolutionized the healthcare industry, and digital health tracking has been quite successful in monitoring patients' health. Since patients are continuously monitored, no matter where they are, these systems can indicate patients' adherence to medical protocols and act as a warning sign for such diseases as heart problems, Alzheimer's disease, and many others. Health Relationship Management Services (HRMS) is a new paradigm which defines comprehensive healthcare for an individual. HRMS is a complete health ecosystem suitable for the workplace, which enables healthcare providers to collect personal health data from various sources, analyze it for positive outcomes, and take action to preserve an employee's good health to reduce absenteeism or turnover.

Stochastic Programming Solution For Placement Of Satellite Ground Stations,"Disaster recovery efforts are enhanced through the collection and dissemination of satellite data, which is downloaded from satellites to ground stations. The optimal ground station locations vary depending on the location of the disaster, but ground station construction occurs before the realization of a disaster. Thus, a stochastic optimization problem arises: decide the location of ground stations before disasters with uncertain locations. We use a stochastic programming approach to select the location of ground stations given a set of potential disaster scenarios. The objective is to maximize the expected amount of data downloaded. The problem formulation consists of a two-stage stochastic program where the first-stage determines the locations of the ground stations and the second-stage schedules the uploading and downloading of data. We solve the problem using the L-shaped method; we find that it significantly outperforms solving the deterministic equivalent problem directly. We also find that an alternate second-stage formulation significantly improves solution time. The optimized set of ground stations found by our algorithm is compared to the set of ground stations operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's; results confirm that the current placement is effective and demonstrate the benefit in adding additional ground stations.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10479-018-2798-y,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
An Open-Source Platform For Gis Data Management And Analytics,"Precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach to improve crop productivity and reduce the environmental impact. However, effective decision making in precision agriculture relies on accurate and timely data acquisition, management, and analysis. The collection of multisource and heterogeneous data for soil characteristics estimation is a critical component of precision agriculture, as it provides insights into key factors, such as soil nutrient levels, moisture content, and texture. To address these challenges, this work proposes a software platform that facilitates the collection, visualization, management, and analysis of soil data. The platform is designed to handle data from various sources, including proximity, airborne, and spaceborne data, to enable precision agriculture. The proposed software allows for the integration of new data, including data that can be collected directly on-board the acquisition device, and it also allows for the incorporation of custom predictive systems for soil digital mapping.

New Perspectives In The Monitoring Of Marine Sedimentary Transport By Satellites—Advantage And Research Directions,"Advances in satellite data, revisit times, computing capacity and processing speed are on their way to deliver a revolution in the monitoring and management of coastal erosion due to systematic remote sensing of the shoreline from space. This represents, and enables further, major progress on a far greater scale than the current state of the art. European public satellites of the Sentinel Constellation (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) of the COPERNICUS program currently offer a revisit time of (i) five days with four satellites under the same viewing conditions, for bathy-topography investigation of the shoreline, i.e. from the continental shelf-break to the foreshore, (ii) a few days at mid latitudes but from different points of view, and (iii) almost daily at higher latitudes. The low resolution (5-to-20 m) of the radar & VNIR components of the time-series is mitigated by high spectral density that allows a true spectral analysis of the earth surface and waters, after appropriate corrections, i.e. removal of atmospheric scattering, sun glint and white caps effects, geometric configuration due to the anisotropic bidirectional soils & waters reflectance distribution function (BRDF). New tools in open source like the SNAP toolbox or interfaces like Coastal Thematic Exploitation platform allow public labs and companies to benefit from this breakthrough in data acquisition, rapid processing or database collection. Via remote sensing techniques, time series of seafloor bathymetry and suspended sediment in the water column can be derived from optical (spectral analysis) and SAR imagery (correlation between radar cross section changes and Bragg scattering of the water-foreshore surface for the assessment of the errors). It complements, when required, Very High Resolution (VHR) surveys made on order with commercial imagery, (or dug out from archives), aerial LiDaR (Light Detection and Ranging) with planes or drones, or depths sounders (on launches) and topographic instrumentation for beach profiling. Yet, the current swarms of nanosatellites such as Planet/Doves give access to systematic VHR cover of the earth.

Using Virtual Environments To Improve The Realism Of Choice Experiments: A Case Study About Coastal Erosion Management,"Choice experiment surveys are commonly used to assess the general public's willingness to pay for different levels of environmental quality. However, respondents need to understand what they are valuing or they will make potentially wrong assumptions based on different experiences and frames of reference. Three-dimensional computer generated models or Virtual Environments (VE) have so far seen little use in economics research, probably due to the complexity and cost of developing and delivering them to study participants. The few studies that have used them find that VE are superior to static image presentations in helping people evaluate complex data. For this study we developed virtual environments for a choice experiment about coastal erosion management using free, easy-to-use software and Google Earth(C) satellite imagery and presented these to respondents as video tours. Our results indicate that the VE treatment reduced choice error, reduced left-right bias and improved respondent engagement and retention when compared with static images. There were also differences in WTP between the two groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jeem.2016.08.001,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Long-Term Degradation Prediction And Assessment With Heteroscedasticity Telemetry Data Based On Gru-Garch And Md Hybrid Method: An Application For Satellite,"Degradation prediction and state-of-health assessment are core information support for on-orbit operation management of satellite. However, the multi-task and on-orbit operation with changeable and complex space environment bring great challenges to predicting and assessing the long-term degradation of satellite. The seasonal variation and heteroscedasticity of status-related telemetry data will lead to a large deviation in the prediction. While, traditional threshold baselines for satellites assessing are simple curves, which are not sensitive to catch the state information of degradation data. To solve these problems, we propose a prediction-assessment methodology which containing data-preprocessing, prediction strategy-model and assessment strategy-model. Data-preprocessing including the elimination of wild values, moving average and Seasonal-Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL), which can accurately dig out the degradation and fluctuation characteristics of satellite long-term telemetry data. The Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) fusion model is proposed to cognize different fluctuation characteristics and further improve the prediction accuracy. Subsequently, an online updateable health baseline construction strategy is proposed, which is effective and sensitive than traditional monitoring means. Based on Mahalanobis distance (MD) and the constructed health baseline, a health assessment model GRU-GARCH-MD is proposed. To comprehensively verify the capabilities of the proposed prediction and health assessment methodology, real telemetry data is quoted from a certain satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit. The prediction in real application can get a result with MAPE of 2.16\% and RMSE of 0.5636 indicate the accuracy and stability of the proposed model, meanwhile, the proposed health baseline construction strategy is superior to the other state-of-the-art methods.

"Assessment Of Modis-Evi, Modis-Ndvi And Vegetation-Ndvi Composite Data Using Agricultural Measurements: An Example At Corn Fields In Western Mexico","Although several types of satellite data provide temporal information of the land use at no cost, digital satellite data applications for agricultural studies are limited compared to applications for forest management. This study assessed the suitability of vegetation indices derived from the TERRA-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) sensor for identifying corn growth in western Mexico. Overall, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites from the VGT sensor based on bi-directional compositing method produced vegetation information most closely resembling actual crop conditions. The NDVI composites from the MODIS sensor exhibited saturated signals starting 30 days after planting, but corresponded to green leaf senescence in April. The temporal NDVI composites from the VGT sensor based on the maximum value method had a maximum plateau for 80 days, which masked the important crop transformation from vegetative stage to reproductive stage. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) composites from the MODIS sensor reached a maximum plateau 40 days earlier than the occurrence of maximum leaf area index (LAI) and maximum intercepted fraction of photosynthetic active radiation (fPAR) derived from in-situ measurements. The results of this study showed that the 250-m resolution MODIS data did not provide more accurate vegetation information for corn growth description than the 500-m and 1000-m resolution MODIS data. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-005-9006-7,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Geostationary Satellite Station-Keeping Using Convex Optimization,"This paper introduces a novel affine formulation of the equations of motion of a satellite in a geostationary orbit and, based on this formulation, presents a method for determining station-keeping maneuvers using convex optimization. The state equations are written as a linear, time-varying system and include all dominant perturbing accelerations. An investigation into the modeling errors is presented to validate and establish fidelity in the approach. The linearity of the system enables the formulation of the station-keeping problem as a convex optimization problem. The optimization-based formulation allows to explicitly account for constraints on state and control variables. The resulting problem canbesolved reliably, requiring only limited computational resources, making the method not only applicable to on-ground open-loop maneuver planning (the current state of the art) but also to a closed-loop onboard implementation. The methodisgeneric and can be appliedto satellites equipped with high-thrust chemical propulsion and low-thrust electric propulsion. The resulting maneuver plans consist of only a few maneuvers. The station keeping method is validated by comparison to a conventional method. Further benefits are demonstrated through an application of the method in the form of receding horizon control. © Copyright 2015 by DLR, German Aerospace Center.",NA,NA,10.2514/1.g001302,excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Machine Learning Approaches For Burned Area Identification Using Sentinel-2 In Central Kalimantan,"Forest or land fire is a disaster that commonly occurred in Indonesia mainly in Kalimantan and Sumatera. Optical remote sensing satellite becomes a promising technology that can be utilized to identify the burned area in quick time for disaster management response.This study evaluated the use of supervised machine learning, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) to classify burned area in the Central Kalimantan province on June and August 2019 as pre-fire event and post-fire event using Sentinel-2 imageries. An imbalanced and a balanced dataset with varying hyper-parameter were used on those classifiers. Hotspot data derived from MODIS and Suomi NPP data are also used as training and testing dataset. Based on the study, the imbalanced dataset influences precision and recall values, as well as the accuracy of SVM and DNN classifiers, but not as much in RF. RF classifier outperforms SVM and DNN in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy for both a balanced dataset and an imbalanced dataset with the accuracy ranged from 98.2 -99.3%. The accuracy of SVM classifier is ranged from 94.7-98.1% for an imbalanced dataset and 90.4 % - 98.2 % for a balanced dataset. Although the high accuracy is still can be achieved in DNN classifier, there is a changing accuracy from 98.5-98.8 % in a balanced dataset to 95.5-95.7% in an imbalanced dataset. These findings imply that the high accuracy is still can be achieved by SVM, RF, and DNN classifiers with an imbalanced or a balanced dataset. © 2020 Institut za Istrazivanja.

Nationwide Prediction Of Drought Conditions In Iran Based On Remote Sensing Data,"Iran is a country in a dry part of the world and extensively suffers from drought. Drought is a natural, temporary, and iterative phenomenon that is caused by shortage in rainfall, which affects people's health and well-being adversely as well as impacting the society's economy and politics with far-reaching consequences. Information on intensity, duration, and spatial coverage of drought can help decision makers to reduce the vulnerability of the drought-affected areas, and therefore, lessen the risks associated with drought episodes. One of the major challenges of modeling drought (and short-term forecasting) in Iran is unavailability of long-term meteorological data for many parts of the country. Satellite-based remote sensing data-that are freely available-give information on vegetation conditions and land cover. In this paper, we constructed artificial neural network to model (and forecast) drought conditions based on satellite imagery. To this end, standardized precipitation index (SPI) was used as a measure of drought severity. A number of features including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and temperature condition index (TCI) were extracted from NOAA-AVHRR images. The model received these features as input and outputted the SPI value (or drought condition). Applying the model to the data of stations for which the precipitation data were available, we showed that it could forecast the drought condition with an accuracy of up to 90 percent. Furthermore, TCI was found to be the best marker of drought conditions among satellite-based features. We also found multilayer perceptron better than radial basis function networks and support vector machines forecasting drought conditions.",NA,NA,10.1109/tc.2013.118,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Research Progress And Challenges Of Data-Driven Quantitative Remote Sensing,"Quantitative remote sensing is a technique for quantitatively inferring or inverting earth environmental variable from the original remote sensing observations, it is an important step to turn electromagnetic wave signals into easy-to-understand information about surface environment. Traditional quantitative remote sensing methods are mainly model-driven, emphasizing inversion through mathematical or physical models. With the development and popularization of artificial intelligence technology, data-driven methods have gradually received widespread attention. It emphasizes the use of machine learning methods to mine the information contained in remote sensing observation data to achieve the quantitative inversion of geophysical parameters. With the support of powerful computing capacity, the data-driven method has achieved gratifying achievements in many fields of quantitative remote sensing. This article systematically summarizes the principles, characteristics, and applications in quantitative remote sensing field of different types of data-driven models, including regression algorithms, regularization methods, instance-based algorithms, decision tree, Bayesian methods, kernel based algorithms, genetic algorithms, ensemble learning, artificial neural network, and deep learning. Though data-driven models show satisfying retrieval performance in multiple fields, its drawbacks of ignoring the laws of physics and lack of causality have also brought resistance to its development. In this context, coupling the laws of physics and machine learning to develop an inversion framework driven by both models and data has become a new research hotspot. Some pioneering researches have already achieved delightful performance through using machine learning to assist physical models or restricting machine learning with physical laws. Using machine learning techniques to optimize the systematic basis, the sub-model, and the model parameters largely improve the performance of model-driven methods. Meanwhile, integrating physics knowledge into machine learning models through adjusting the training data, modifying the loss function, and constraining the solution space also benefit the improvement of data-driven models. However, there are still great challenges to be broken through. Physical models contain complex mechanisms and rich knowledge, current fusion of data-driven and model-driven methods are quite shallow with very limited amount of physical knowledge being used. A deeper coupling strategy is worth exploring in the future. Besides, the uncertainty, generalization, and transferability of the joint model have not been scientifically evaluated currently, to which attention should be paid. Finally, there are many cases when the training samples were very difficult to obtain, therefore, the applicability of the joint model in the case of small samples is also a problem that needs to be solved urgently. The deep, robust, and generalizable coupling of data-driven and model-driven models is expected in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

Decentralized Water Reuse Planning: Evaluation Of Life Cycle Costs And Benefits,"The objective of this paper is to comparatively evaluate the life cycle costs and expected monetary benefits of decentralized greywater reuse systems. Specifically, added life cycle costs and estimated life cycle monetary benefits of satellite and onsite greywater reuse systems are evaluated in comparison with the prevailing centralized systems. Centralized systems refer to the traditional form of water delivery where one centralized treatment plant treats and distributes potable water to a large service area through a water distribution network while a sewer network collects used water for treatment at a centralized wastewater treatment plant before the wastewater effluent is disposed into the environment. Satellite greywater reuse systems collect raw greywater at neighborhood or district level for treatment and re-distribution for non-potable uses within the same neighborhood or district. Onsite greywater reuse systems collect raw greywater for treatment on the premises of where it is produced after which it is re-distributed for permitted non-potable use on the same premises. Infrastructure needs and associated life cycle cost information for both types of greywater reuse systems are appropriately modeled or synthesized from literature. The skeletal layout of a real-world water distribution network is adapted for performing the cost-benefit analysis in this study. Finally, sensitivity of the cost-benefit tradeoff associated with satellite and onsite greywater reuse adoption scenarios is evaluated for various uncertainties associated with technological evolution, policy incentives, and planning schemes. Given that several states in the U.S. are expected to face water shortages in the near future, this paper will provide guidance to water utilities and policy makers in planning of future water supply alternatives.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.05.016,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Optimal Guidance Whale Optimization Algorithm And Hybrid Deep Learning Networks For Land Use Land Cover Classification,"Satellite Image classification provides information about land use land cover (LULC) and this is required in many applications such as Urban planning and environmental monitoring. Recently, deep learning techniques were applied for satellite image classification and achieved higher efficiency. The existing techniques in satellite image classification have limitations of overfitting problems due to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model generating more features. This research proposes the optimal guidance-whale optimization algorithm (OG-WOA) technique to select the relevant features and reduce the overfitting problem. The optimal guidance technique increases the exploitation of the search technique by changing the position of the search agent related to the best fitness value. This increase in exploitation helps to select the relevant features and avoid overfitting problems. The input images are normalized and applied to AlexNet-ResNet50 model for feature extraction. The OG-WOA technique is applied in extracted features to select relevant features. Finally, the selected features are processed for classification using Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM).

An Optimization Framework With Improved Auction-Based Initialization For Highly Constrained On-Orbit Servicing Mission Planning,"The on-orbit servicing (OOS) mission planning problem for multiple geosynchronous earth orbit (GSO) satellites is a critical issue due to its huge economic value. However, given the complexity of the space scenario and the subjective nature of the formulation process, the problem is highly constrained in actual use, and the performance of conventional optimization algorithms decreases due to fuel or mission deadline constraints. With the goal of enhancing solution quality and speeding up the solution process, this paper proposes a novel optimization framework. The problem is decomposed into three sub-problems and then solved using the proposed three-level algorithm to lessen its complexity. In addition, a new initialization method is embedded to improve global search capabilities. Notably, considering the high computation efficiency of the auction algorithm (AA), an improved version is designed to generate primary solutions, which introduces the grouping and reallocation mechanism. Then, several variations of the primary solutions are used as the initial variables in the optimization.

"Advancements In Medium And High Resolution Earth Observation For Land-Surface Imaging: Evolutions, Future Trends And Contributions To Sustainable Development","Technologies for imaging the surface of the Earth, through satellite based Earth observations (EO) have enormously evolved over the past 50 years. The trends are likely to evolve further as the user community increases and their awareness and demands for EO data also increases. In this review paper, a development trend on EO imaging systems is presented with the objective of deriving the evolving patterns for the EO user community. From the review and analysis of medium-to-high resolution EO-based land-surface sensor missions, it is observed that there is a predictive pattern in the EO evolution trends such that every 10-15 years, more sophisticated EO imaging systems with application specific capabilities are seen to emerge. Such new systems, as determined in this review, are likely to comprise of agile and small payload-mass EO land surface imaging satellites with the ability for high velocity data transmission and huge volumes of spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution data.

Remote Sensing And Gis Data/Information In The Emergency Response/Recovery Phase,"Based on popular images and scientific literature discussing geographic information science (GIScience) approaches for hazard analysis, it might be assumed that GIScience is a core element in the response and recovery phases of the disaster cycle. Findings from our research suggest that the use of GIScience in disaster response/recovery is: (1) in an evolutionary phase and (2) timing and coordination are major impediments. In Spring 2005 (prior to Hurricane Katrina), a survey was conducted of all state-level emergency preparedness offices to determine geographic information system/remote sensing use (hereafter referred to as geographic information technologies, or GIT) and spatial data needs. While a few states had five to seven staff educated in GIT, 23\% had no spatial analysts in early 2005. Thus, for many states the adoption of GIT is still in its infancy. This finding also indicates that many state emergency management agencies (EMAs) would benefit from external (e.g., state/local/federal agency, private, university) expertise in order to utilize GIT during a hazard event. With a focus on remote sensing, we use three hurricane events to illustrate the federal government's work to change procedures associated with GIT during response/recovery efforts. Concrete and anecdotal information on the role of GIT in Hurricanes Andrew (1992), Floyd (1999), and Katrina (2005) are provided. Acceptance of GIT must be based on timeliness of data/information, awareness by the user community, and appropriate application to response/recovery endeavors.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-90-481-2238-7\_16,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Cognitive Intelligence Assisted Fog-Cloud Architecture For Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Gad) Prediction,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a psychological disorder caused by high stress from daily life activities. It causes severe health issues, such as sore muscles, low concentration, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. The less availability of predictive solutions specifically for individuals suffering from GAD can become an imperative reason for health and psychological adversity. The proposed solution aims to monitor health, behavioral and environmental parameters of the individual to predict health adversity caused by GAD. Initially, Weighted-Naïve Bayes (W-NB) classifier is utilized to predict irregular health events by classifying the captured data at the fog layer. The proposed two-phased decision-making process helps to optimize the distribution of required medical services by determining the scale of vulnerability. Furthermore, the utility of the framework is increased by calculating health vulnerability index using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) on the cloud.

Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72\%, 69\%, and 57\% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152880,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Ocean Surface Partitioning Strategies Using Ocean Colour Remote Sensing: A Review,"The ocean surface is organized into regions with distinct properties reflecting the complexity of interactions between environmental forcing and biological responses. The delineation of these functional units, each with unique, homogeneous properties and underlying ecosystem structure and dynamics, can be defined as ocean surface partitioning. The main purposes and applications of ocean partitioning include the evaluation of particular marine environments; generation of more accurate satellite ocean colour products; assimilation of data into biogeochemical and climate models; and establishment of ecosystem-based management practices. This paper reviews the diverse approaches implemented for ocean surface partition into functional units, using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) data, including their purposes, criteria, methods and scales. OCRS offers a synoptic, high spatial-temporal resolution, multi-decadal coverage of bio-optical properties, relevant to the applications and value of ocean surface partitioning. In combination with other biotic and/or abiotic data, OCRS-derived data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, optical properties) provide a broad and varied source of information that can be analysed using different delineation methods derived from subjective, expert-based to unsupervised learning approaches (e.g., cluster, fuzzy and empirical orthogonal function analyses). Partition schemes are applied at global to mesoscale spatial coverage, with static (time-invariant) or dynamic (time-varying) representations. A case study, the highly heterogeneous area off SW Iberian Peninsula (NE Atlantic), illustrates how the selection of spatial coverage and temporal representation affects the discrimination of distinct environmental drivers of phytoplankton variability. Advances in operational oceanography and in the subject area of satellite ocean colour, including development of new sensors, algorithms and products, are among the potential benefits from extended use, scope and applications of ocean surface partitioning using OCRS.

Loss Of Snap Is Associated With Food Insecurity And Poor Health In Working Families With Young Children,"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps working families meet their nutritional needs. Families whose earned income increases in a given month may have their SNAP benefits abruptly reduced or cut off in the following month. Using sentinel sample data from 2007-15 for families with children younger than age four, we investigated how SNAP benefit reductions or cutoffs resulting from increased income were related to economic hardships (food and energy insecurity, unstable housing, forgone health and/or dental care, and health cost sacrifices) and to caregiver and child health. After we controlled for covariates, we found that the groups whose SNAP benefits were reduced or cut off had significantly increased odds of household and child food insecurity, compared to a group with consistent participation in SNAP. Reduced benefits were associated with 1.43 and 1.22 times greater odds of fair or poor caregiver and child health, respectively. Policy modifications to smooth changes in benefit levels as work incomes improve may protect working families with young children from increased food insecurity, poor health, and forgone care.",NA,NA,10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05265,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Monitoring Surface Water Area Variations Of Reservoirs Using Daily Modis Images By Exploring Sub-Pixel Information,"Information on the temporal variation of surface water area of reservoirs is fundamental for water resource management and is often monitored by satellite remote sensing. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery is an attractive data source for the routine monitoring of reservoirs, however, the accuracy is often limited due to the negative impacts associated with its coarse spatial resolution and the effects of cloud contamination. Methods have been proposed to solve these two problems independently but it remains challenging to address both problems simultaneously. To overcome this, this paper proposes a new approach that aims to monitor reservoir surface water area variations accurately and timely from daily MODIS images by exploring sub-pixel scale information. The proposed approach used estimates of reservoir water areas obtained from cloud-free and relatively fine spatial resolution Landsat images and water fraction images by spectral unmixing of coarse MODIS imagery as reference data. For each MODIS pixel, these reference reservoir water areas and their corresponding pixel water fractions were used to construct a linear regression equation, which in turn may be applied to predict the time series of reservoir water areas from daily MODIS water fraction images. The proposed approach was assessed with 21 reservoirs, where the correlation coefficients between reservoir water areas predicted by the common pixel-based analysis method and altimetry water levels were all less than 0.5. With the proposed sub-pixel analysis method, the resultant correlation coefficients were much improved, with eleven values larger than 0.5 including six values larger than 0.8 and the highest value of 0.94. The results show that the proposed sub-pixel analysis method is superior to the pixel based analysis method. The proposed method makes it possible to directly estimate the whole reservoir water area from, potentially, an individual cloud-free MODIS pixel, and is a promising way to improve the accuracy in the usability of MODIS images for the monitoring of reservoir surface water area variations.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.08.008,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Cotton Farming Industry Development And Policy Finance Support For Demand Estimation In Aksu,"Using data mining, the purpose of this study is to forecast and analyze the growth of the cotton cultivation industry and the policy financial support demands in the Aksu region. Data mining is a method for maximizing the value of data via the application of numerous algorithms. In contrast to conventional data mining, which adheres to specific algorithms, data mining employs a variety of analysis algorithms to analyze raw data, such as image and panel data, and produce accurate results. In this paper, we propose a data mining method that combines the semantic segmentation algorithm of remote sensing images with various nonlinear regression algorithms to predict the demand for policy-based financial support in a specific region based on a combination of multiple factors, including agricultural crop cultivation area, catastrophe analyses, agricultural price and inflation rates, etc. This paper intends to estimate and analyze actual data pertaining to the cotton cultivation industry in Aksu, and this methodology can further improve the policy-based financial inverse model.

Modeling And Optimization Approaches For Satellite Broadcast Scheduling Problem,"A low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system has a range of missions delivering economic, environmental, and social benefits utilized by everyone almost every day. However, there exists a challenge for operational management of satellites in LEO because they are not accessible from a given point of earth at all times. In that case, a problem evolves that should be solved is to find a valid broadcasting pattern between satellites and ground stations. Nevertheless, being defined as the satellite broadcast scheduling (SBS) problem almost three decades ago, the few numbers of published studies on the problem used a restricted variety of solution approaches. The recent advances in information technology and tremendous undergoing change in the industrial automation entails handling the SBS problem more comprehensively and propose innovative solution approaches. This article proposes and evaluates three metaheuristic approaches for the SBS problem. A relaxation and decomposition approach is also proposed for generating tighter upper bounds to make justified performance evaluations. Besides the benchmark problems reported in the literature, new benchmark instances are generated and used in computational experiments.

Deep Hybrid Network For Land Cover Semantic Segmentation In High-Spatial Resolution Satellite Images,"Land cover semantic segmentation in high-spatial resolution satellite images plays a vital role in efficient management of land resources, smart agriculture, yield estimation and urban planning. With the recent advancement in remote sensing technologies, such as satellites, drones, UAVs, and airborne vehicles, a large number of high-resolution satellite images are readily available. However, these high-resolution satellite images are complex due to increased spatial resolution and data disruption caused by different factors involved in the acquisition process. Due to these challenges, an efficient land-cover semantic segmentation model is difficult to design and develop. In this paper, we develop a hybrid deep learning model that combines the benefits of two deep models, i.e., DenseNet and U-Net. This is carried out to obtain a pixel-wise classification of land cover. The contraction path of U-Net is replaced with DenseNet to extract features of multiple scales, while long-range connections of U-Net concatenate encoder and decoder paths are used to preserve low-level features. We evaluate the proposed hybrid network on a challenging, publicly available benchmark dataset. From the experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrid network exhibits a state-of-the-art performance and beats other existing models by a considerable margin. © 2021 by the authors.

A New Method For Estimating Chlorophyll- A Concentration In The Pearl River Estuary,"Accurate and reliable assessment of chlorophyll- A (Chl-a) concentration in turbid waters by remote sensing is challenging due to optical complexity of case II waters. Recently, an optimization procedure based on minimizing root mean square error (RMSE) with three-band model was suggested to retrieve the Chl- A concentration in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in China. However, it is sensitive to initial values of model parameters and it doesn't consider other two bands information to determine each optimal band. To estimate the Chl- A concentration according to information of all bands without initial values, we proposed an optimization procedure based on maximizing correlation of the Chl- A concentration in situ and the Chl- A concentration estimated. Firstly, correlations are computed with the three-band model, in which each band varies from the minimal value to the maximal value. Secondly, the sum of correlations for all values of other two bands is computed to find the optimal value for the first band. Lastly, the sum of correlations for all values of other one band with the first optimal band is computed to find the second and third optimal bands. The calibrated three-band model is applied to retrieve the Chl- A concentration from the reflectance data in the PRE on May 16, 2008. RMSE and correlation indices of our method and two state-of-the-art methods in this dataset are shown the effectiveness of our method. These findings imply that the extensive database of remote sensing could be used to quantitatively monitor the Chl- A concentration in the PRE. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Introducing Environmental Externalities Into Transport Pricing: Measurement And Implications,"It is European Commission policy to charge modes of transport according to the marginal social cost of their use of the infrastructure, including environmental costs. However, progress in implementing this process has been slow, partly because of the difficulty of measuring and valuing these costs. This need has led to a great deal of research in this area in recent years. The paper presents the results of some of this research, and in particular of the European Commission-funded Unification of Accounts and Marginal Costs for Transport Efficiency (UNITE) project. UNITE used the Impact Pathway Approach developed in the ExternE project series to provide a bottom-up methodology for the estimation and valuation of marginal social costs of transport, taking into account the diversity of circumstances in terms of location (e. g. population density, and speed and direction of winds) and time of day. The paper first explains the approach used for the measurement and valuation of environmental costs and then presents results on both total and marginal costs. It then discusses the results of a parallel project using the same methodology that estimated the marginal social cost of road use at a very disaggregate level for different vehicle types, locations, types of road and times of day for Great Britain. The results show that off the main network and outside the conurbations, private cars are currently overcharged, but elsewhere they are charged too little, particularly in the main conurbations. Buses, and even more so heavy goods vehicles, are undercharged to a greater extent. Only a kilometre-based charging system capable of charging at different rates by vehicle type, type and location of road, and time of day is capable of reflecting all these differences; due to the development of global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, such systems are now becoming available.",NA,NA,10.1080/01441640600602039,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Automated Analysis Of Spatial Grids,"Environmental data are often spatial in nature. In this chapter, we will examine image processing techniques which play a key role in artificial applications operating on spatial data. These AI applications often seek to extract information from the spatial data and use that information to aid decision makers. Consider for example, land cover data. Since different locations have different types and amounts of forestry, land cover information has to be explicitly tied to geographic location. Such spatial data may be collected either through in-situ (in place) measurements or by remote sensing over large areas. An insitu measurement of land cover, for example, would involve visiting, observing and cataloging the type of land cover at a particular location. A remotely sensed measurement of land cover might be carried out from a satellite. The remotely-sensed measurement would cover a much larger area, but would be indirect (i.e., the land coverage would have to be inferred from the satellite channels) and would be gridded (i.e., one would get only one land cover value for one pixel of the satellite image). Users of land-cover data often wish to use the data to recover higher-level information such as determining what fraction of a particular country is wooded-AI applications help provide such an answer, building on well understood image processing methods. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-1-4020-9119-3_16,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Negative Associations Between Quality Of Urban Green Spaces And Health Expenditures In Downtown Shanghai,"The health-beneficial value of urban green spaces (UGS) is increasingly accepted by scholars. However, compared to the large number of studies focused on UGS-health associations, whether UGS in high-density cities could reduce public health expenditures remains less investigated. In particular, few studies have examined the association of UGS quality with health expenditures. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study in downtown Shanghai to examine such associations. A population-based household survey (n = 1000) was conducted to collect relevant information about different aspects of health expenditure and the characteristics of UGS. Specifically, a new method was proposed to measure UGS quality based on the supply-demand of 20 types of UGS activities. We also measured the perceived quality of different types of UGS and quantified the amount of UGS using GIS based on remote sensing data. Regression models were applied for statistical analysis. The results showed that both UGS quality based on user needs and perceived UGS quality have a significant negative association with total health expenditures. This study provides insights for UGS quality measurement, contributes to the understanding of the health-related economic benefits of UGS, and also highlights the importance of UGS optimization in high-density urban areas.",NA,NA,10.3390/land11081261,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Real-World Data Analytics Fit For Regulatory Decision-Making,"Healthcare database analyses (claims, electronic health records) have been identified by various regulatory initiatives, including the 21(st) Century Cures Act and Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA""), as useful supplements to randomized clinical trials to generate evidence on the effectiveness, harm, and value of medical products in routine care. Specific applications include accelerated drug approval pathways and secondary indications for approved medical products. Such real-world data (""RWD"") analyses reflect how medical products impact health outside a highly controlled research environment. A constant stream of data from the routine operation of modern healthcare systems that can be analyzed in rapid cycles enables incremental evidence development for regulatory decision-making. Key evidentiary needs by regulators include 1) monitoring of medication performance in routine care, including the effectiveness, safety and value; 2) identifying new patient strata in which a drug may have added value or unacceptable harms; and 3) monitoring targeted utilization. Four broad requirements have been proposed to enable successful regulatory decision-making based on healthcare database analyses (collectively, ""MVET""): Meaningful evidence that provides relevant and context-informed evidence sufficient for interpretation, drawing conclusions, and making decisions; valid evidence that meets scientific and technical quality standards to allow causal interpretations: expedited evidence that provides incremental evidence that is synchronized with the decision-making process; and transparent evidence that is audible, reproducible, robust, and ultimately trusted by decision-makers. Evidence generation systems that satisfy MVET requirements to a high degree will contribute to effective regulatory decision-making. Rapid-cycle analytics of healthcare databases is maturing at a time when regulatory overhaul increasingly demands such evidence.

"Design, Development, And Experimental Verification Of A Trajectory Algorithm Of A Telepresence Robot","Featured Application: Healthcare, remote sensing, and military. Background: Over the last few decades, telepresence robots (TRs) have drawn significant attention in academic and healthcare systems due to their enormous benefits, including safety improvement, remote access and economics, reduced traffic congestion, and greater mobility. COVID-19 and advancements in the military play a vital role in developing TRs. Since then, research on the advancement of robots has been attracting much attention. Methods: In critical areas, the placement and movement of humans are not safe, and researchers have started looking at the development of robots. Robot development includes many parameters to be analyzed, and trajectory planning and optimization are among them. The main objective of this study is to present a trajectory control and optimization algorithm for a cognitive architecture named auto-MERLIN. Optimization algorithms are developed for trajectory control. Results: The derived work empirically tests the solutions and provides execution details for creating the trajectory design. We develop the trajectory algorithm for the clockwise direction and another one for the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Conclusions: Experimental results are drawn to support the proposed algorithm. Self-localization, self-driving, and right and left turn trajectories are drawn. All of the experimental results show that the designed TR works properly, with better accuracy and only a slight jitter in the orientation. The jitter is found due to the environmental factor caught by the sensors, which can be filtered easily. The results show that the proposed approach is less complex and provides better trajectory planning accuracy. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/app13074537,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Evaluation Of Deep Learning Benchmarks In Retrieving Outfalls Into Rivers With Uas Images,"Outfall surveys are critical to basin environmental and ecosystem protection. High-spatial-resolution remote sensing has been a key technology in outfall surveys. However, manual visual interpretation of outfalls from unmanned aircraft system (UAS) images is inefficient. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning method has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate method for retrieving specific objects from remote sensing imagery. However, CNN's architecture and features are often proposed to detect common objects from universal images that are less complex than the specific remote sensing objects. Thus, an optimal CNN benchmark is significant to the performance of CNN-based approaches in the field of remote sensing. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art CNN architectures and features for improving the geo-deep learning CNN for outfalls (GDCNN-outfalls) we proposed. We found that Faster R-CNN combined with feature pyramid network (FPN) and generalized intersection over union (GIoU) or complete intersection over union (CIoU) are the most suitable benchmarks, with AP(50) values of 68.7 and 67.0, respectively, which are better than those of cascade R-CNN (AP(50) of 64.6) and Libra R-CNN (AP(50) of 62.7). You only look once (YOLO)-v4 can be an alternative with an AP(50) of 66.8 and comprehensively considers retrieval accuracy, the current GPU performance, and the application needs.

Exploiting Remote Sensing Imagery For Vehicle Detection And Classification Using An Artificial Intelligence Technique,"Remote sensing imagery involves capturing and examining details about the Earth's surface from a distance, often using satellites, drones, or other aerial platforms. It offers useful data with which to monitor and understand different phenomena on Earth. Vehicle detection and classification play a crucial role in various applications, including traffic monitoring, urban planning, and environmental analysis. Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized vehicle detection in remote sensing. This study designs an improved Chimp optimization algorithm with a DL-based vehicle detection and classification (ICOA-DLVDC) technique on RSI. The presented ICOA-DLVDC technique involves two phases: object detection and classification. For vehicle detection, the ICOA-DLVDC technique applies the EfficientDet model. Next, the detected objects can be classified by using the sparse autoencoder (SAE) model. To optimize the SAE's hyperparameters effectively, we introduce an ICOA which streamlines the parameter tuning process, accelerating convergence and enhancing the overall performance of the SAE classifier. An extensive set of experiments has been conducted to highlight the improved vehicle classification outcomes of the ICOA-DLVDC technique. The simulation values demonstrated the remarkable performance of the ICOA-DLVDC approach compared to other recent techniques, with a maximum accuracy of 99.70\% and 99.50\% on the VEDAI dataset and ISPRS Postdam dataset, respectively.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15184600,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Decision-Level Fusion With A Pluginable Importance Factor Generator For Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification,"Remote sensing image scene classification acts as an important task in remote sensing image applications, which benefits from the pleasing performance brought by deep convolution neural networks (CNNs). When applying deep models in this task, the challenges are, on one hand, that the targets with highly different scales may exist in the image simultaneously and the small targets could be lost in the deep feature maps of CNNs; and on the other hand, the remote sensing image data exhibits the properties of high inter-class similarity and high intra-class variance. Both factors could limit the performance of the deep models, which motivates us to develop an adaptive decision-level information fusion framework that can incorporate with any CNN backbones. Specifically, given a CNN backbone that predicts multiple classification scores based on the feature maps of different layers, we develop a pluginable importance factor generator that aims at predicting a factor for each score. The factors measure how confident the scores in different layers are with respect to the final output. Formally, the final score is obtained by a class-wise and weighted summation based on the scores and the corresponding factors. To reduce the co-adaptation effect among the scores of different layers, we propose a stochastic decision-level fusion training strategy that enables each classification score to randomly participate in the decision-level fusion. Experiments on four popular datasets including the UC Merced Land-Use dataset, the RSSCN 7 dataset, the AID dataset, and the NWPU-RESISC 45 dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Satellite-Based Imagery Techniques For Daytime Cloud/Snow Delineation From Modis,"This paper presents two multispectral enhancement techniques for distinguishing between regions of cloud and snow cover using optical spectrum passive radiometer satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Fundamental to the techniques are the 1.6- and 2.2-mu m shortwave infrared bands that are useful in distinguishing between absorbing snow cover (having low reflectance) and less absorbing liquid-phase clouds (higher reflectance). The 1.38-mu m band helps to overcome ambiguities that arise in the case of optically thin cirrus. Designed to provide straightforward, stand-alone environmental characterization for operational forecasters (e.g., military weather forecasters in the context of mission planning), these products portray the information that is contained within complex scenes as value-added, readily interpretable imagery at the highest available spatial resolution.

Hierarchical Bandwidth Allocation For Social Community-Oriented Multicast In Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks,"With the rapid advance of wireless communication technologies, the promising space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) are advocated to provide ubiquitous multicast transmission services for the social community constituted by a group of mobile users that have strong social ties and similar content interests. However, due to the limited yet valuable spectrum resources, the network heterogeneity, and diverse service demands of mobile users, it is challenging to efficiently allocate bandwidth for social communities with the objective of achieving satisfactory quality of experience (QoE) in SAGINs. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical bandwidth allocation scheme to enable high-quality multicast services for social communities in SAGINs. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical bandwidth allocation framework. Wherein, the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite is utilized to provide space-to-air (S2A) unicast bandwidth for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at a certain price. Each UAV is employed to provide air-to-ground (A2G) multicast bandwidth for ground social communities with a certain A2G multicast bandwidth charge. We then formulate the hierarchical bandwidth allocation problem as a four-stage Stackelberg game, where the target of each participant is to maximize its own utility. Afterward, through the game analysis by the backward induction method, the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved, where the closed-form solutions on the optimal policies of both the social communities and UAVs are derived by the convex optimization method, and the optimal pricing policies of the LEO satellite is achieved by a proposed gradient descent iteration algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly increase the utilities of social communities while consuming a less bandwidth compared to conventional schemes.",NA,NA,10.1109/twc.2022.3207923,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Decision Support Systems For Monitoring And Maintaining Health In Food Animal Populations,"To mitigate the effects of risks to food safety and infectious disease outbreaks in farmed animals, animal health authorities need to have systems in place to identify and trace the source of identified problems in a timely manner. In the event of emergencies, these systems will allow infected or contaminated premises (and/or animals) to be identified and contained, and will allow the extent of problems to be communicated to consumers and trading partners in a clear and unambiguous manner. The key to achieving these goals is the presence of an effective animal health decision support system that will provide the facilities to record and store detailed information about cases and the population at risk, allowing information to be reported back to decision makers when it is required. Described here are the components of an animal health decision support system, and the ways these components can be used to enhance food safety, responses to infectious disease incursions, and animal health and productivity. Examples are provided to illustrate the benefit these systems can return, using data derived from countries that have such systems (or parts of systems) in place. Emphasis is placed on the features that make particular system components effective, and strategies to ensure that these are kept up to date. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,10.1080/00480169.2007.36780,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Implementing Nurse Prescribing Within The Haemodialysis Unit,"Patients within satellite haemodialysis units do not always have access to a medical practitioner. This may cause problems when prescriptions are required. Amendments to UK law to allow the introduction of supplementary prescribing came into force in 2003 allowing nurses with the appropriate experience, training and qualification to prescribe for their patients. Within a 14-station satellite unit a prescribing partnership has been successfully established. Clinical Management Plans have been implemented for haemodialysis patients. These include areas such as dialysis adequacy, access management, anti-coagulation, anaemia management, MRSA treatment and prophylaxis, antihypertensive therapy, calcium and phosphate control and exit site or line infection. 100\% of patients within the unit have consented to the nurse prescribing for them under the Clinical Management Plan. Supplementary prescribing enhances nursing practice by empowering those who are best placed to make decisions regarding care and treatment for their patients.

Soil quality must be maintained to ensure sustainable production of food and conservation of natural resources. In this context, soil mapping is important to provide spatial information, which can be performed using remote sensing (RS) techniques. Modeling through use of satellite data is uncertain regarding the amplitude of replicability of the models. The aim of this study was to develop a quantification model for soil texture based on reflectance information from a continuum of bare soils, obtained by overlapping multi-temporal satellite images, and apply this model to an unknown region to evaluate its applicability. Spectral data were extracted from two Landsat TM 7 satellite images containing only bare soil, representing two distinct regions in Brazil (Area 1 and Area 2). The spectral data (obtained from six bands) and laboratory data (particle size from the 0.00-0.20 m layer) of Area 1 were modeled and extrapolated to Area 2. The bare soil images differentiated textural classes as sandy, sandy loam, clayey loam, clayey, and very clayey soil. The coefficients of determination between the determined and estimated values were higher than 0.5 and errors lower than 13 % for Area 1 and 30 % for Area 2, indicating applicability of the model to unknown areas. © 2018 Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

Applications Of Vegetative Indices From Remote Sensing To Agriculture: Past And Future,"Remote sensing offers the capability of observing an object without being in contact with the object. Throughout the recent history of agriculture, researchers have observed that different wavelengths of light are reflected differently by plant leaves or canopies and that these differences could be used to determine plant biophysical characteristics, e.g., leaf chlorophyll, plant biomass, leaf area, phenological development, type of plant, photosynthetic activity, or amount of ground cover. These reflectance differences could also extend to the soil to determine topsoil properties. The objective of this review is to evaluate how past research can prepare us to utilize remote sensing more effectively in future applications. To estimate plant characteristics, combinations of wavebands may be placed into a vegetative index (VI), i.e., combinations of wavebands related to a specific biophysical characteristic. These VIs can express differences in plant response to their soil, meteorological, or management environment and could then be used to determine how the crop could be managed to enhance its productivity. In the past decade, there has been an expanded use of machine learning to determine how remote sensing can be used more effectively in decision-making. The application of artificial intelligence into the dynamics of agriculture will provide new opportunities for how we can utilize the information we have available more effectively. This can lead to linkages with robotic systems capable of being directed to specific areas of a field, an orchard, a pasture, or a vineyard to correct a problem. Our challenge will be to develop and evaluate these relationships so they will provide a benefit to our food security and environmental quality.",NA,NA,10.3390/inventions4040071,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
"Geocollaboration In Hazard, Risk And Response: Practical Experience With Real-Time Geocollaboration At Québec Civil Security","The pertinence of outputs from geographic analysis and airborne- and space-based sensors to hazard recognition, risk analysis and emergency response is well established. They are contributors – remotely-sensed or analytical information is not sufficient by itself. Useful application of geospatial data requires information from multiple sources, first during analysis and then to provide geographical context. The resulting product is useful to emergency management (EM)emergency management (EM) specialists, planners and other decision makers. Even then, however, these users may not have the capability to apply the information effectively. The problem is one of delivery: how to deliver the information rapidly and accompany it with the expertise required for use. The delivery problem is particularly acute in decision making in the EM response phase. During response, the utility of geospatial information is related to the time it takes to acquire, process and analyze data, and then make it pertinent in the decision environment. Furthermore, these steps are not simply linear – analysis of the geospatial information may have to be adjusted, and very rapidly, using in situ measures and observations. One way to resolve the problem is to add a georeferenced, real-time collaboration environment to the software and procedures used to produce geospatial information. This combination allows adjustments in analysis and interpretation, along with the input of expertise from multiple domains. In this paper, we describe applications of geospatial information with software for live Internet geocollaboration in civil security operating in the Quèbec Ministry of Public Security. The illustrations come from real emergency management situations. © 2008, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-3-540-79259-8_12,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Multi-Class Strategies For Joint Building Footprint And Road Detection In Remote Sensing,"Building footprints and road networks are important inputs for a great deal of services. For instance, building maps are useful for urban planning, whereas road maps are essential for disaster response services. Traditionally, building and road maps are manually generated by remote sensing experts or land surveying, occasionally assisted by semi-automatic tools. In the last decade, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated their capabilities to extract these elements automatically and accurately from remote sensing imagery. The building footprint and road network detection problem can be considered a multi-class semantic segmentation task, that is, a single model performs a pixel-wise classification on multiple classes, optimizing the overall performance. However, depending on the spatial resolution of the imagery used, both classes may coexist within the same pixel, drastically reducing their separability. In this regard, binary decomposition techniques, which have been widely studied in the machine learning literature, are proved useful for addressing multi-class problems. Accordingly, the multi-class problem can be split into multiple binary semantic segmentation sub-problems, specializing different models for each class. Nevertheless, in these cases, an aggregation step is required to obtain the final output labels. Additionally, other novel approaches, such as multi-task learning, may come in handy to further increase the performance of the binary semantic segmentation models. Since there is no certainty as to which strategy should be carried out to accurately tackle a multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem, this paper performs an in-depth study to shed light on the issue. For this purpose, open-access Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (at 10 m) are considered for extracting buildings and roads, making use of the well-known U-Net convolutional neural network. It is worth stressing that building and road classes may coexist within the same pixel when working at such a low spatial resolution, setting a challenging problem scheme. Accordingly, a robust experimental study is developed to assess the benefits of the decomposition strategies and their combination with a multi-task learning scheme. The obtained results demonstrate that decomposing the considered multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem into multiple binary ones using a One-vs.-All binary decomposition technique leads to better results than the standard direct multi-class approach. Additionally, the benefits of using a multi-task learning scheme for pushing the performance of binary segmentation models are also shown.",NA,NA,10.3390/app11188340,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Role Of Forest Canopy Cover In Habitat Selection: Insights From The Iberian Lynx,"Habitat selection models for woodland species usually consider forest attributes derived from land cover maps, such as an area covered by forests or distance to forest edge, but canopy cover is less frequently used as a predictor. We evaluated the effect of including forest canopy cover data in habitat selection models for woodland species using the endangered Iberian lynx as a case study. We considered four canopy cover classes for both conifer and broadleaved forests, together with other land cover predictors, and analyzed a large telemetry (GPS-GSM collars) dataset. The model that included forest canopy cover outperformed, both in predictive power and in conservation management insights, the model that only used forest area. The effect of forest canopy cover on lynx habitat selection was especially strong for broadleaved forests; an increased tree cover in these forests consistently translated into significantly lower selection probabilities. Open broadleaved forests were found to clearly be the most preferred habitat. By contrast, the habitat model without canopy cover data indicated that broadleaved forests were significantly less preferred than shrublands and mountain olive groves, which may mislead conservation management actions. We conclude that habitat selection models for woodland species should consider forest canopy cover as a relevant candidate predictor as it can capture important factors influencing habitat use, such as understory vegetation abundance or prey availability. Recent developments on remote sensing technologies will increase the availability of spatially continuous information on canopy cover, facilitating a more widespread use of vegetation structural variables in habitat modeling and hence improving the conservation planning value of these models.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10344-019-1266-6,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Validation Of The Global Registry Of Acute Coronary Event (Grace) Risk Score For In-Hospital Mortality In Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome In Canada,"Background: The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Event (GRACE) risk score was developed in a large multinational registry to predict in-hospital mortality across the broad spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Because of the substantial regional variation and temporal changes in patient characteristics and management patterns, we sought to validate this risk score in a contemporary Canadian population with ACS. Methods: The main GRACE and GRACE2 registries are prospective, multicenter, observational studies of patients with ACS (June 1999 to December 2007). For each patient, we calculated the GRACE risk score and evaluated its discrimination and calibration by the c statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, respectively. To assess the impact of temporal changes in management on the GRACE risk score performance, we evaluated its discrimination and calibration after stratifying the study population into prespecified subgroups according to enrollment period, type of ACS, and whether the patient underwent coronary angiography or revascularization during index hospitalization. Results: A total of 12,242 Canadian patients with ACS were included; the median GRACE risk score was 127 (25th and 75th percentiles were 103 and 157, respectively). Overall, the GRACE risk score demonstrated excellent discrimination (c statistic 0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.86, P < .001) for in-hospital mortality. Similar results were seen in all the subgroups (all c statistics ≥0.8). However, calibration was suboptimal overall (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .06) and in various subgroups. Conclusions: GRACE risk score is a valid and powerful predictor of adverse outcomes across the wide range of Canadian patients with ACS. Its excellent discrimination is maintained despite advances in management over time and is evident in all patient subgroups. However, the predicted probability of in-hospital mortality may require recalibration in the specific health care setting and with advancements in treatment. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

Monitoring Urban Areas With Sentinel-2a Data: Application To The Update Of The Copernicus High Resolution Layer Imperviousness Degree,"Monitoring with high resolution land cover and especially of urban areas is a key task that is more and more required in a number of applications (urban planning, health monitoring, ecology, etc.). At the moment, some operational products, such as the ""Copernicus High Resolution Imperviousness Layer"", are available to assess this information, but the frequency of updates is still limited despite the fact that more and more very high resolution data are acquired. In particular, the recent launch of the Sentinel-2A satellite in June 2015 makes available data with a minimum spatial resolution of 10 m, 13 spectral bands, wide acquisition coverage and short time revisits, which opens a large scale of new applications. In this work, we propose to exploit the benefit of Sentinel-2 images to monitor urban areas and to update Copernicus Land services, in particular the High Resolution Layer imperviousness. The approach relies on independent image classification (using already available Landsat images and new Sentinel-2 images) that are fused using the Dempster-Shafer theory. Experiments are performed on two urban areas: a large European city, Prague, in the Czech Republic, and a mid-sized one, Rennes, in France. Results, validated with a Kappa index over 0.9, illustrate the great interest of Sentinel-2 in operational projects, such as Copernicus products, and since such an approach can be conducted on very large areas, such as the European or global scale. Though classification and data fusion are not new, our process is original in the way it optimally combines uncertainties issued from classifications to generate more confident and precise imperviousness maps. The choice of imperviousness comes from the fact that it is a typical application where research meets the needs of an operational production. Moreover, the methodology presented in this paper can be used in any other land cover classification task using regular acquisitions issued, for example, from Sentinel-2.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs8070606,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Spatial Data For National Fire Planning And Fuel Management,"Spatial data products are most often developed to support resource management decisions. Rarely can the data stand by themselves as spatially-explicit risk assessments. We discuss the technical aspects of true risk assessments, and the contrast between risk assessments and the underlying spatial data that an agency might use to perform one. We then present the development methodology and results from a comprehensive, national effort at creating resource data products that may be useful in agency- or geographically-specific risk assessments. We have produced a suite of spatial data layers, each a continuous coverage for the conterminous United States, to support national-level, programmatic planning efforts for fire and fuel management. This document describes the development of seven data layers: (1) Potential Natural Vegetation Groups; (2) Current Cover Types; (3) Historical Natural Fire Regimes; (4) Current Condition Classes; (5) National Fire Occurrence; (6) Potential Fire Characteristics; and (7) Population Density Groups. This paper documents the methodology used to develop the spatial products. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to integrate biophysical and remote sensing products with disturbance and succession processes. We then assigned attributes developed from succession diagrams to combinations of biophysical, current vegetation, and historical fire regime data layers. Regional ecologists, silviculturists, and fire managers developed the succession diagrams, reviewed and refined the data layers, and assigned condition classes. None of these data layers were developed to stand alone as an integrated risk assessment. Technically-robust risk assessments require quantification not only of the probability of an event occurring-wildland fire in this case-but also of the values at risk of damage or loss. The 'values' component of a risk assessment is highly dependent on the resource management policies and objectives of the responsible agency. The data presented here were developed for integration by individual agencies into agency-specific plans and risk assessments. For example, planners will use the Current Condition Class data to allocate resources for fire and fuel management. These data are posted on the national.

Comparison Of Object And Pixel-Based Land Cover Classification Through Three Supervised Methods,"Land cover has undergone tremendous changes in the last century, with strong consequences on the environmental balance, therefore the classification of land cover using Earth Observation data is very important. Recently, the widely used pixel-based approach for land cover classification was questioned through the emergence of the object-based approach. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the performances of pixel-based and object-based approaches through three classification methods, Random Trees, Decision Tree and Kappa Nearest Neighbor, for land cover classification using Landsat satellite imagery. Our results suggest that using methods based on decision trees (Random Trees or Decision Tree) the accuracy values are superior in the object-based approach compared to pixel-based approach. Instead, using KNN classification, accuracy values are superior in the pixel-based approach.",NA,NA,10.12902/zfv-0165-2017,excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Water Resource Monitoring Systems And The Role Of Satellite Observations,"Spatial water resource monitoring systems (SWRMS) can provide valuable information in support of water management, but current operational systems are few and provide only a subset of the information required. Necessary innovations include the explicit description of water redistribution and water use from river and groundwater systems, achieving greater spatial detail (particularly in key features such as irrigated areas and wetlands), and improving accuracy as assessed against hydrometric observations, as well as assimilating those observations. The Australian water resources assessment (AWRA) system aims to achieve this by coupling landscape models with models describing surface water and groundwater dynamics and water use. A review of operational and research applications demonstrates that satellite observations can improve accuracy and spatial detail in hydrological model estimation. All operational systems use dynamic forcing, land cover classifications and a priori parameterisation of vegetation dynamics that are partially or wholly derived from remote sensing. Satellite observations are used to varying degrees in model evaluation and data assimilation. The utility of satellite observations through data assimilation can vary as a function of dominant hydrological processes. Opportunities for improvement are identified, including the development of more accurate and higher spatial and temporal resolution precipitation products, and the use of a greater range of remote sensing products in a priori model parameter estimation, model evaluation and data assimilation. Operational challenges include the continuity of research satellite missions and data services, and the need to find computationally-efficient data assimilation techniques. The successful use of observations critically depends on the availability of detailed information on observational error and understanding of the relationship between remotely-sensed and model variables, as affected by conceptual discrepancies and spatial and temporal scaling.",NA,NA,10.5194/hess-15-39-2011,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A Survey Of Geomatics Solutions For The Rapid Mapping Of Natural Hazards,"Natural hazards demand a rapid assessment of the crisis situation and the use of Geomatics platforms, sensors and techniques can efficiently answer this need. Remotely sensed data can, in fact, provide a valuable source of broad scale information at each stage of the disaster management cycle, supporting scientists and authorities in the decision-making process. Geomatics-based procedures and techniques can be especially exploited in the emergency mapping domain for the extraction of reference (pre-event) and crisis (post-event) geographic data. The major challenges today concern the efficient selection (and integration) of the most fit-forpurpose mapping solution(s) and the development of automatic procedures to increase efficiency in data processing. This survey article provides a review of the current optical remote sensing sensors (both satellite and airborne) for rapid mapping applications. Advantages and disadvantages are evaluated in order to support the selection process of the most appropriate means to gather the required information (i.e., significant and value-added data). Since valuable information should be delivered in a very short time, the management of time is defined as a priority and several solutions are discussed to pursue efficiency in both data acquisition and processing.

Quantifying Tropical Dry Forest Type And Succession: Substantial Improvement With Lidar,"Improved technologies are needed to advance our knowledge of the biophysical and human factors influencing tropical dry forests, one of the world's most threatened ecosystems. We evaluated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to address two major needs in remote sensing of tropical dry forests, i.e., classification of forest types and delineation of forest successional status. We evaluated LiDAR-derived measures of three-dimensional canopy structure and subcanopy topography using classification-tree techniques to separate different dry forest types and successional stages in the Guánica Biosphere Reserve in Puerto Rico. We compared the LiDAR-based results with classifications made from commonly used remote sensing data, including Landsat satellite imagery and radar-based topographic data. The accuracy of the LiDAR-based forest type classification (including native- and exotic-dominated forest classes) was substantially higher than those from previously available data (kappa = 0.90 and 0.63, respectively). The best result was obtained when combining LiDAR-derived metrics of canopy structure and topography, and adding Landsat spectral data did not improve the classification. For the second objective, we observed that LiDAR-derived variables of vegetation structure wereNuevas tecnol better predictors of forest successional status (i.e., mid-secondary, late-secondary, and primary forests) than was spectral information from Landsat. Importantly, the key LiDAR predictors identified within each classification-tree model agreed with previous ecological knowledge of these forests. Our study highlights the value of LiDAR remote sensing for assessing tropical dry forests, reinforcing the potential for this novel technology to advance research and management of tropical forests in general. © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",NA,NA,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00904.x,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Effects Of A Dredging Operation On The Movement And Dive Behaviour Of Marine Turtles During Breeding,"Dredging presents a risk of injury or mortality to marine turtles via entrainment, vessel strike or the effects of noise and vibration. Dredging operations have increased in recent years, yet there remains an absence of supporting information for development proponents and regulators to accurately determine dredge-related impact predictions for marine turtles within an Environmental Impact Assessment This absence therefore has implications for their conservation, as certain dredging impacts may be overlooked or the implementation of control measures and response strategies may be ineffective. This study presents a case study involving a major resource development whose proponent undertook satellite tracking of 48 reproductively-active flatback turtles (Natator depressus) at different stages of its dredging operation (before: n = 20, during: n = 10 and after: n = 18). In addition, trained Marine Fauna Observers were on-board dredge vessels to mitigate interaction and detect injury and mortality events. We compared the dredge-related impact predictions stated in the Environmental Impact Assessment with the quantified dredge-related impact to flatback turtles as represented by changes to their movement and dive behaviour between each stage of the dredging operation and any injury and mortality events. Additionally, we considered the effectiveness of implemented dredge-related control measures in preventing their injury or mortality. We found that during the active dredging operation, flatback turtles increased their use of the dredging areas. Dive behaviour results showed they undertook longer and deeper resting dives during dredging, utilising the now deeper waters of the dredging areas. Possible reasons for this preferential use of areas being dredged are discussed. Despite their increased use and the presence of active dredge vessels, no events of injury or mortality were recorded. The implemented control measures may have been effective in preventing injury or mortality, though the spatial scale of their effectiveness may have been smaller than first anticipated. Our results are of great value for stakeholders involved in marine turtle conservation and managing dredging operations worldwide as no comparison of quantified marine turtle survivorship, movement and dive behaviour data at different stages of a dredging program has been recorded or reported previously.

Economics Of Riparian Beneficial Management Practices For Improved Water Quality: A Representative Farm Analysis In The Canadian Prairie Region,"This paper examines the economics of adopting agricultural beneficial management practices (BMPs) to protect riparian areas in the Canadian Prairies. Monte Carlo simulation methods and cost/benefit analysis (net present value) are used to evaluate BMP adoption for a set of representative cropping and mixed farm operations in Alberta and Saskatchewan. BMPs considered in the analysis involve restoration, maintenance and/or protection of riparian areas and associated wetlands. Implementation of these BMPs by the representative farms is generally costly, resulting in negative net benefits. This is primarily due to opportunity costs from forgone returns and BMP establishment costs. The farm level results are combined with estimates of public values for riparian ecosystem services using the Pannell land use policy framework. Results indicate that in many cases, positive incentives, such as subsidies or conservation auctions, are appropriate policy responses to encourage increased production of riparian/wetland ecosystem services. Given the uncertainty in public and private benefit estimates, it may also be the case that no intervention is the optimal policy response in some instances. There is significant scope for further research in order to obtain better estimates of benefits and costs associated with riparian area management.

"Accounting For Value Changes In Cultivated Land Resources Within The Karst Mountain Area Of Southwest China, 2001-2020","Cultivated land resources are important natural resource assets that are related to food security and sustainable development.

To-Yolox: A Pure Cnn Tiny Object Detection Model For Remote Sensing Images,"Remote sensing and deep learning are being widely combined in tasks such as urban planning and disaster prevention. However, due to interference occasioned by density, overlap, and coverage, the tiny object detection in remote sensing images has always been a difficult problem. Therefore, we propose a novel TO-YOLOX(Tiny Object-You Only Look Once) model. TO-YOLOX possesses a MiSo(Multiple-in-Single-out) feature fusion structure, which exhibits a spatial-shift structure, and the model balances positive and negative samples and enhances the information interaction pertaining to the local patch of remote sensing images.

To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TO-YOLOX, we utilized three aerial-photography tiny object detection datasets, namely VisDrone2021, Tiny Person, and DOTA-HBB, and the following mean average precision (mAP) values were recorded, respectively: 45.31\% (+10.03\%), 28.9\% (+9.36\%), and 63.02\% (+9.62\%).

Determination Of Appropriate Remote Sensing Indices For Spring Wheat Yield Estimation In Mongolia,"In Mongolia, the monitoring and estimation of spring wheat yield at the regional and national levels are key issues for the agricultural policy and food management as well as for the economy and society as a whole. The remote sensing data and technique have been widely used for the estimation of crop yield and production in the world. For the current research, nine remote sensing indices were tested that include normalized difference drought index (NDDI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health index (VHI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), and vegetation supply water index (VSWI). These nine indices derived from MODIS/Terra satellite have so far not been used for crop yield prediction in Mongolia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the best remote sensing indices in order to develop an estimation model for spring wheat yield using correlation and regression method. The spring wheat yield data from the ground measurements of eight meteorological stations in Darkhan and Selenge provinces from 2000 to 2017 have been used. The data were collected during the period of the growing season (June-August). Based on the analysis, we constructed six models for spring wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the range of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of estimated spring wheat yield was between 4.1 (100 kg ha(-1)) to 4.8 (100 kg ha(-1)), respectively. The range of the mean absolute error (MAE) values was between 3.3 to 3.8 and the index of agreement (d) values was between 0.74 to 0.84, respectively. The conclusion was that the best model would be (R-2 = 0.55) based on NDWI, VSDI, and NDVI out of the nine indices and could serve as the most effective predictor and reliable remote sensing indices for monitoring the spring wheat yield in the northern part of Mongolia. Our results showed that the best timing of yield prediction for spring wheat was around the end of June and the beginning of July, which is the flowering stage of spring wheat in this study area. This means an accurate yield prediction for spring wheat can be achieved two months before the harvest time using the regression model.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11212568,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Swin-Resunet+: An Edge Enhancement Module For Road Extraction From Remote Sensing Images,"Road extraction from remote sensing images is very important in navigation, urban planning, traffic management and other fields. Deep learning methods have achieved great success in computer vision tasks. Therefore, road extraction from remote sensing images using deep learning methods can significantly improve the road extraction accuracy. However, these methods generally have problems such as low road extraction accuracy, slow training speed, high computational complexity, and poor road topology connectivity. In order to solve the above issues, we propose a Swin-ResUNet+ structure and use the new paradigm Swin-Transformer to extract roads in remote sensing images. Specifically, we construct an Edge Enhancement module based on residual connection and add this module to each stage of the encoder, which can obtain the edge information in remote sensing images. Based on the Edge Enhancement module, we propose a Swin-ResUNet+ structure in order to better capture the topology of roads. On the Massachusetts road dataset, our model has the least computational cost with only less than one percent accuracy decrease. On the DeepGlobe2018 road dataset, our model not only has the least computational complexity but also achieves the highest values of mIOU, mDC, mPA and F1-score. In a word, Swin-ResUNet+ obtains a much better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than previous CNN-based and Transformer-based methods. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103807,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Integration Of Remote-Sensing Based Metrics And Econometric Models To Assess The Socio-Economic Contributions Of Carbon Sequestration In Unmanaged Tropical Dry Forests,"Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-benefits of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-benefits of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic benefits. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efficiency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a benefit transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration's monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 +/- 3.3 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) or in total, 1.16 GtCO(2). The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ha(-1) yr(-1) to USD 2828 ha(-1) yr(-1). These results can open new perspectives regarding the benefits of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).",NA,NA,10.1016/j.indic.2021.100100,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Advances In Integrated System Health Management For Mission-Essential And Safety-Critical Aerospace Applications,"Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) is a promising technology that fuses sensor data and historical state-of-health information of components and subsystems to provide actionable information and enable intelligent decision-making regarding the operation and maintenance of aerospace systems. ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS).",NA,NA,10.1016/j.paerosci.2021.100758,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Making Satellite Precipitation Data Work For The Developing World,"In an era of declining ground-based networks for measurement of precipitation, satellite precipitation data, that is now routinely available in increasing frequency and spatial coverage, represents an interesting paradox. Specifically, effective assessment frameworks and error metrics for satellite precipitation data must be developed for advancing the utility of satellite data for global applications. While there seems to be a concerted effort by the community to evaluate satellite precipitation data, there does not seem to be similar efforts to resolve the paradoxical issue of balancing the need for global uncertainty information and the stark lack of global GV datasets for doing so. In this article, we present one practical approach to estimating satellite precipitation uncertainty that is not dependent on the notion of ground validation (GV) data. By using input that is more readily available around the globe (i.e., satellite data and geophysical features of terrain, climate and seasons), the approach can potentially advance applications as it allows a coherent way to merge available satellite precipitation data products to a more superior state, particularly for hydrologic applications. We provide an assessment of how the approach works in various regions of the developing world as a way to encourage the community to further the development of such ideas and provide end-users with a practical decision-making tool.",NA,NA,10.1109/mgrs.2014.2317561,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Development And Evaluation Of Hybrid Deep Learning Long Short-Term Memory Network Model For Pan Evaporation Estimation Trained With Satellite And Ground-Based Data,"Evaporation, as a core process within the global hydrological cycle, requires reliable methods to monitor its variation, for decision-making in agriculture, irrigation systems and dam operations, also in other areas of hydrology and water resource management. Accurate monitoring of pan evaporation (E-p) is one the most popular approaches to understand the evaporative process. This work aims to construct a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive model that is coupled with Neighbourhood Component Analysis for feature selection to predict E-P in drought-prone regions in Queensland, Australia (Amberley, Gatton, Oakey, \& Townsville). Utilizing the daily-scale dataset {[}31 August 2002 to 22 September 2020], the performance of the proposed deep learning (DL) hybrid model, denoted as NCA-LSTM, is compared with competitive benchmark models, i.e., standalone LSTM, other types of DL, single hidden layer neuronal architecture and decision tree-based method. The testing results reveal the lowest Relative Root Mean Square Error ( <= 20\%), Absolute Percentage Bias ( <= 14.5\%) and the highest Kling-Gupta Efficiency ( >= 87\%) attained by the NCA-LSTM hybrid model (relative to benchmark models) tested for Amberley, Gatton, and Oakey sites. In respect to the predictive efficiency, the proposed NCA-LSTM hybrid model, improved with feature selection, outperforms all benchmark models, indicating its future utility in the prediction of daily E-p. In practical sense, the predictive model developed for E-p estimation provides an accurate estimation of evaporative water loss in hydrological cycle and therefore, can be implemented in areas of irrigation management, planning of irrigation-based agriculture, and mitigation of financial losses to agricultural and related sectors where, regular monitoring and forecasting of water resources are a vital part of sustainable livelihood and business.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127534,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Statistical Object-Based Method For Forest Change Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Objective: Collecting forest-change information accurately, quickly and efficiently to update forest resource databases in time is critically important for scientific decision-making of forest management and forestry sustainable development, and has long been one of the major technical challenges in forest resource management. Method: In this paper, an object-based statistical method was applied to detect forest changes in a study site located in Shangsi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region where the forest cover has experienced frequent changes over time associated with a large number of parcels with relatively small sizes. High spatial resolution satellite images of ZY-3, GF-1 and the vector sub-compartment map of forest distribution were served as the data sources. Object features were extracted by using multi-resolution segmentation of satellite images accompanying with the thematic map. As the frequencies of the difference of the objects' mean gray value and standard deviation of the two-temporal images were approximate the normal distributions, chi-square distribution statistic was using with the difference between object mean value and standard deviation. Therefore the change objects with abnormal statistics were flagged one by one with a statistical procedure of iterative trimming. Result: The results indicated that for a given confidence level, the detected number of change objects decreased rapidly as the iteration number increased. When the confidence level was set at 0.95, 0.98, 0.99 and 0.999, the corresponding changed objects were labeled through 25, 23, 20 and 15 iterations, respectively. Along with changes in the confidence levels from 0.95 to 0.99, the omission rate increased, as a result, the commission rate decreased and the overall accuracy increased. The best result was achieved with the confidence level was 0.99 as the overall accuracy was 92.6% and the Kappa was 0.764 8. Conclusion: The advantage of the method proposed in this paper was object-based and statistically driven, directly detected forest changes from the dataset generated from the image segmentation, did not rely on external information and human intervention, could be executed automatically in the entire procedure, and generated satisfactory results. Furthermore, this approach was potentially an ideal method for forest change detection. © 2017, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

Near Real-Time Disturbance Detection Using Satellite Image Time Series,"Near real-time monitoring of ecosystem disturbances is critical for rapidly assessing and addressing impacts on carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/). © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.022,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Air Quality Forecasts Improved By Combining Data Assimilation And Machine Learning With Satellite Aod,"Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data assimilation (DA) using numerical air quality forecast models has shown a limited improvement due to large uncertainties in the AOD observation operator. This study employed a machine learning (ML) algorithm to estimate the ground-level particulate matter (PM) from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) AOD through the random forest with high accuracy. Analysis fields were subsequently produced by applying PM estimations to the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry/three-dimensional variational DA system. Initialization of the model with the new analysis remarkably reduced the analysis error and increased the forecast skill. The PM10 prediction showed significant benefits for up to 24 forecast hours, whereas PM2.5 prediction was improved for up to six forecast hours. Considering a broad spatial coverage by satellites, the synergistic use of DA and ML can maximize the effectiveness of satellite DA for air quality forecasts at the ground. © 2021.

Conceptualising Circular Economy Performance With Non-Traditional Valuation Methods: Lessons For A Post-Pandemic Recovery,"The circular economy (CE) has gained importance in the post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery. Businesses, while realising the CE benefits, have challenges in justifying and evaluating the CE benefits using available performance measurement tools, specifically when considering sustainability and other non-traditional benefits. Given the rising institutional pressures for environmental and social sustainability, we argue that organisations can evaluate their CE implementation performance using non-market-based environmental goods valuation methods. Further, the effectiveness of the CE performance measurement model can be enhanced to support supply chain sustainability and resilience through an ecosystem of multi-stakeholder digital technologies that include a range of emerging technologies such as blockchain technology, the internet-of-things (IoT), artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and tracking technologies. Accordingly, a CE performance measurement model (CEPMM) is conceptualised and exemplified using seven COVID-19 disruption scenarios to provide insights that can be addressed through CE practices.

"Application Of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Data For Habitat Mapping Of Pacific Islands: Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean)","Sustainable and ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is a priority of Pacific Island countries basing their economy on marine resources. The urgency of management coral reef systems and associated coastal environments, threatened by the effects of climate change, require a detailed habitat mapping of the present status and a future monitoring of changes over time. Here, we present a remote sensing study using free available Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping at large scale the most sensible and high value habitats (corals, seagrasses, mangroves) of Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean), carried out without any sea truth validation. Remote sensing 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' classification methods applied to 2017 Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m resolution together with comparisons with free ancillary data on web platform and available scientific literature were used to map mangrove, coral, and seagrass communities in the Palau Archipelago. This paper addresses the challenge of multispectral benthic mapping estimation using commercial software for preprocessing steps (ERDAS ATCOR) and for benthic classification (ENVI) on the base of satellite image analysis. The accuracy of the methods was tested comparing results with reference NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA) habitat maps achieved through Ikonos and Quickbird imagery interpretation and sea-truth validations. Results showed how the proposed approach allowed an overall good classification of marine habitats, namely a good concordance of mangroves cover around Palau Archipelago with previous literature and a good identification of coastal habitats in two sites (barrier reef and coastal reef) with an accuracy of 39.8-56.8%, suitable for survey and monitoring of most sensible habitats in tropical remote islands. © 2019 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/jmse7090316,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Reliability And Availability Analysis For An On Board Computer In A Satellite System Using Standby Redundancy And Rejuvenation,"A large number of technologies are used in a satellite because it is hard difficult to repair and replace its components after it has been launched. Furthermore, there are many threats to the satellite such as software aging, environmental problems and network attacks. Because of this nature, it is important that the satellite operates well in spite of the occurrence of hardware and/or software faults. In particular, software aging in the on-board computer (OBC) causes unavailability of a whole satellite system. In this paper, we propose to adopt software rejuvenation for OBC in conjunction with cold, hot and warm standby redundancy in a satellite system. We use stochastic reward nets (SRN) to model OBC with cold, hot and warm standby redundancy and model OBC with that redundancy with software rejuvenation. We compare the models in terms of steady state availability and downtime cost. Sensitivity analysis with respect to some parameters is used to find bottlenecks of the models. Finally, we present a reliability model and analysis with cost consideration. © 2012 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,NA,10.1007/s12206-012-0512-6,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Mutual Information Based Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Image Registration Using Adaptive Feature Weight,"Multi-module images registration is a challenging task in image processing, and more especially in the field of remote sensing. In this letter, we strive to present a novel mutual information scheme for image registration in remote sensing scenario based on feature map technique. We firstly take saliency detection advantages to extract geographic pattern, and then utilize the efficient Laplacian of Gaussian(LOG) and Guided Filter methods to construct a new feature map based on different characteristic of multi-channel images. To avoid practical traps of sub-optimization, we propose an novel mutual information(MI) algorithm based on an adapted weight strategy. The proposed model divides an image into patches and assigns weighted values according to patch similarities in order to solve the optimization problem, improve accuracy and enhance performance. Note that, our proposed method incorporates the LOG and Guided Filter methods into image registration for the first time to construct a new feature map based on differences and similarities strategy. Experiments are conducted over island and coastline scenes, and reveal that our hybrid model has a significant performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image registration. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,NA,10.1080/2150704x.2018.1458343,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Evaluation Of Tree-Base Data Mining Algorithms In Land Used/Land Cover Mapping In A Semi-Arid Environment Through Landsat 8 Oli Image; Shiraz, Iran","Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping has been used in different environmental applications including disaster management, risk analysis, heat island mapping, and the effects of urbanization on environmental changes such as floods and droughts in the recent decade. The earth's natural surface coverage including urban infrastructure, surface vegetation, bare soil can be identified with LULC maps. Besides, LULC is one of the most important tasks in natural hazards, planning activities, resource management, and global monitoring studies. The present study aimed to improve the level of land used and land cover change mapping in a semi-arid environment using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. In this research, several tree-based algorithms for LULC mapping are used and compared. These algorithms are used in a combination model implementation of WEKA 3.8 and R programming language to provide a method of a fit-for-purpose algorithms for LULC mapping. It is found that Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REP Tree) is the best approach according to the training and test datasets which are four classes including the build-up, soil, roads, and vegetation region pixels in a semi-arid environment. For the training dataset, the best values of Overall Accuracy (OA), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is determined, 99.7313, 0.002 and 0.0354 as well as for the test dataset are 99.7313, 0.002 and 0.0354, respectively.

Methods To Adjust Willingness-To-Pay Measures For Severity Of Illness,"Objectives: Both private sector organizations and governmental health agencies increasingly use illness severity measures to adjust willingness-to-pay thresholds. Three widely discussed methods-absolute shortfall (AS), proportional shortfall (PS), and fair innings (FI)-all use ad hoc adjustments to cost-effectiveness analysis methods and ""stair-step"" brackets to link illness severity with willingness-to-pay adjustments. We assess how these methods compare with microeconomic expected utility theory-based methods to value health gains.Methods: We describe standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods, the basis from which AS, PS, and FI make severity adjustments. We then develop how the Generalized Risk Adjusted Cost Effectiveness (GRACE) model assesses value for differing illness and disability severity. We compare AS, PS, and FI against value as defined by GRACE.Results: AS, PS, and FI have major and unresolved differences between them in how they value various medical interventions. Compared with GRACE, they fail to properly incorporate illness severity or disability. They conflate gains in health-related quality of life and life expectancy incorrectly and confuse the magnitude of treatment gains with value per quality-adjusted life-year. Stair-step methods also introduce important ethical concerns.Conclusions: AS, PS, and FI disagree with each other in major ways, demonstrating that at most, one correctly describes patients' preferences. GRACE offers a coherent alternative, based on neoclassical expected utility microeconomic theory, and can be readily implemented in future analyses. Other approaches that depend on ad hoc ethical statements have yet to be justified using sound axiomatic approaches.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jval.2023.02.001,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Dsanet: A Deep Supervision-Based Simple Attention Network For Efficient Semantic Segmentation In Remote Sensing Imagery,"Semantic segmentation for remote sensing images (RSIs) plays an important role in many applications, such as urban planning, environmental protection, agricultural valuation, and military reconnaissance. With the boom in remote sensing technology, numerous RSIs are generated; this is difficult for current complex networks to handle. Efficient networks are the key to solving this challenge. Many previous works aimed at designing lightweight networks or utilizing pruning and knowledge distillation methods to obtain efficient networks, but these methods inevitably reduce the ability of the resulting models to characterize spatial and semantic features. We propose an effective deep supervision-based simple attention network (DSANet) with spatial and semantic enhancement losses to handle these problems. In the network, (1) a lightweight architecture is used as the backbone; (2) deep supervision modules with improved multiscale spatial detail (MSD) and hierarchical semantic enhancement (HSE) losses synergistically strengthen the obtained feature representations; and (3) a simple embedding attention module (EAM) with linear complexity performs long-range relationship modeling. Experiments conducted on two public RSI datasets (the ISPRS Potsdam dataset and Vaihingen dataset) exhibit the substantial advantages of the proposed approach. Our method achieves 79.19\% mean intersection over union (mIoU) on the ISPRS Potsdam test set and 72.26\% mIoU on the Vaihingen test set with speeds of 470.07 FPS on 512 x 512 images and 5.46 FPS on 6000 x 6000 images using an RTX 3090 GPU.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14215399,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Inter-Satellite Optical Wireless Communication (Isowc) Systems Challenges And Applications: A Comprehensive Review,"Satellite communication, in over half a century have attained remarkable breakthrough in high speed transmission. These innovations, on the other hand, have come in tandem with significant performance improvements in other IT and telecommunications systems. As a result, these significant benefits are not as visible to the broader public as they would be as if this burst of performance had occurred in isolation. In nutshell, space satellite communication using optical technology provide powerful alternative to radio frequency (RF) and make communication reliable and cost effective. Satellite communications systems allow a whole new race of civilian and defence operations in surveillance, telecommunications, object tracking and space exploration. Since independent satellites are restricted by volume, space and strength, small satellites production in bulk clusters may be effective for a range of wildfire monitoring, science missions, mapping in gravity and water management exploration, among others. The development of communications satellites would provide for a more comprehensive understanding of the near-earth environment as well as a more efficient and cost-effective way of reaching space, thanks to the utilisation of multi-satellite systems. As a result, when satellites are designing, IsOWC is an utmost point to be considered. The numerous researches being performed in the satellite communications for introducing multi communications based on different orbits are described in this study. IsOWC systems over radio frequency based communication are preferred due to large bandwidth, high speed, absence of electromagnetic interference (EMI), lower transmission losses and improved security. We also present a detailed listing of challenges in Is-OWC such as Doppler shift, point ahead angle, satellite vibration and tracking, acquisition tracking and pointing (ATP) and background noise sources. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",NA,NA,10.1515/joc-2022-0075,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Global Land Cover Mapping At 30 M Resolution: A Pok-Based Operational Approach,"Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300 m and 1000 m, a 30 m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products. Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30 m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65\%) at global scale at 30 m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80\% was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30 m resolution. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Quantitative Inversion Of Long Sequential Leaf Area Index Using Remote Sensing Based On Bp Neural Network From 1988 To 2013,"Leaf Area Index(LAI) can reflect the horizontal coverage, vertical structure of vegetation, the thickness of the litter layer and the amount of underground biomass, which is the main aspect of vegetation affecting soil erosion. It is very important to monitor the changes in the amount of soil erosion, for useful information to guide the planning of soil and water conservation, protect the soil and water resources and control the soil erosion. Therefore, the method by which we obtain high quality and long sequential LAI at a regional scale is very important for analyzing the relationship between the dynamic changes in soil erosion and vegetation. Previous studies showed that the neural network had an incomparable superiority in terms of complex, nonlinear data fitting and pattern recognition, and had been successfully applied to inverse the LAI in Nanjing based on the multi-spectral remote sensing data derived from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager(OLI), four types of vegetation indices(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; Ratio Vegetation Index, RVI; Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index, SAVI; Modified Soil adjusted Vegetation Index, MSAVI), and measured LAI data. The results showed that the accuracy of retrieval was good. In this paper, we used the Back Propagation(BP) neural network model to inverse the LAI in Nanjing during 1988-2013 based on the data derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM). Based on the measured values of LAI in 2009 and 2010, the evaluation accuracy and adaptability of the model were verified and discussed. The results showed that:(1) The model had a fitting of higher degree, and average relative errors (MAPE), root mean square errors(RMSE), and correlation coefficients(R) in 2009 and 2010 of 0.2395 and 0.2174, 0.2962 and 0.2581, and 0.7713 and 0.6844, respectively. Each accuracy evaluation index was good. (2) Following statistical analysis, we found that the low vegetation coverage area (LAI < 2) exhibited an increasing trend, the high vegetation coverage area (LAI > 3) presented a first decreasing and then increasing trend, while the cultivated land area decreased with the rapid development in Nanjing.(3) To analyze accurately the LAI, we extracted the LAI in the main urban area, and found that there was a relatively high inversion value, and the inter-annual change in LAI was consistent with the change in vegetation coverage in Nanjing reported by other studies. Therefore, we could see that the BP neural network model had a high accuracy for the time series LAI inversion. It provides a new way for quantitative remote sensing monitoring of regional soil erosion. Moreover, because of other potential limiting factors, such as the errors produced by the BP neural network model, the large area of the inversion area, the complexity of vegetation types and community structure, etc., the inversion accuracy of LAI through remote sensing still needs to be explored, and the inversion method improved. We will try to establish a multi-angle LAI inversion method to construct the coupling model of LAI and soil erosion or quantitative fusion of multi-source remote sensing images in the future study. © 2018 Science Press.

The Surveillance Outbreak Response Management And Analysis System (Sormas): Digital Health Global Goods Maturity Assessment,"Background: Digital health is a dynamic field that has been generating a large number of tools; many of these tools do not have the level of maturity required to function in a sustainable model. It is in this context that the concept of global goods maturity is gaining importance. Digital Square developed a global good maturity model (GGMM) for digital health tools, which engages the digital health community to identify areas of investment for global goods. The Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) is an open-source mobile and web application software that we developed to enable health workers to notify health departments about new cases of epidemic-prone diseases, detect outbreaks, and simultaneously manage outbreak response. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the maturity of SORMAS using Digital Square’s GGMM and to describe the applicability of the GGMM on the use case of SORMAS and identify opportunities for system improvements. Methods: We evaluated SORMAS using the GGMM version 1.0 indicators to measure its development. SORMAS was scored based on all the GGMM indicator scores. We described how we used the GGMM to guide the development of SORMAS during the study period. GGMM contains 15 subindicators grouped into the following core indicators: (1) global utility, (2) community support, and (3) software maturity. Results: The assessment of SORMAS through the GGMM from November 2017 to October 2019 resulted in full completion of all subscores (10/30, (33%) in 2017; 21/30, (70%) in 2018; and 30/30, (100%) in 2019). SORMAS reached the full score of the GGMM for digital health software tools by accomplishing all 10 points for each of the 3 indicators on global utility, community support, and software maturity. Conclusions: To our knowledge, SORMAS is the first electronic health tool for disease surveillance, and also the first outbreak response management tool, that has achieved a 100% score. Although some conceptual changes would allow for further improvements to the system, the GGMM already has a robust supportive effect on developing software toward global goods maturity. © Daniel Tom-Aba, Bernard Chawo Silenou, Juliane Doerrbecker, Carl Fourie, Carl Leitner, Martin Wahnschaffe, Maté Strysewske, Chinedu Chukwujekwu Arinze, Gerard Krause.",NA,NA,10.2196/15860,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Control Of Cattle Ticks And Tick- Borne Diseases By Acaricide In Southern Province Of Zambia: A Retrospective Evaluation Of Animal Health Measures According To Current One Health Concepts,"One health thinking for health interventions is increasingly being used to capture previously unseen stakeholders and impacts across people, animals, and the environment. The Network for One Health Evaluation (NEOH) proposes a systems-based framework to quantitatively assess integration and highlight the added value (theory of change) that this approach will bring to a project. This case study will retrospectively evaluate the pioneering use of a One Health (OH) approach during an international collaboration (satellite project to tackle production losses due to tick-borne disease in cattle in Southern Zambia in late 1980s). The objective of the evaluation is twofold: retrospective evaluation the OH-ness of the satellite project and identification of costs and benefits. Data for evaluation was recovered from publications, project documents, and witness interviews. A mixed qualitative and quantitative evaluation was undertaken. In this case study, a transdisciplinary approach allowed for the identification of a serious public health risk arising from the unexpected reuse of chemical containers by the local public against advice. Should this pioneering project not have been completed then it is assumed this behavior could have had a large impact on public wellbeing and ultimately reduced regional productivity and compromised welfare. From the economic evaluation, the costs of implementing this OH approach, helping to avoid harm, were small in comparison to overall project costs. The overall OH Index was 0.34. The satellite project demonstrated good OH operations by managing to incorporate the input across multiple dimensions but was slightly weaker on OH infrastructures (OH Ratio = 1.20). These quantitative results can be used in the initial validation and benchmarking of this novel framework. Limitations of the evaluation were mainly a lack of data due to the length of time since project completion and a lack of formal monitoring of program impact. In future health strategy development and execution, routine monitoring and evaluation from an OH perspective (by utilizing the framework proposed by NEOH), could prove valuable or used as a tool for retrospective evaluation of existing policies. © 2018 Laing, Aragrande, Canali, Savic and De Meneghi.",NA,NA,10.3389/fpubh.2018.00045,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Integrating Fuzzy Object Based Image Analysis And Ant Colony Optimization For Road Extraction From Remotely Sensed Images,"Updated road network as a crucial part of the transportation database plays an important role in various applications. Thus, increasing the automation of the road extraction approaches from remote sensing images has been the subject of extensive research. In this paper, we propose an object based road extraction approach from very high resolution satellite images. Based on the object based image analysis, our approach incorporates various spatial, spectral, and textural objects’ descriptors, the capabilities of the fuzzy logic system for handling the uncertainties in road modelling, and the effectiveness and suitability of ant colony algorithm for optimization of network related problems. Four VHR optical satellite images which are acquired by Worldview-2 and IKONOS satellites are used in order to evaluate the proposed approach. Evaluation of the extracted road networks shows that the average completeness, correctness, and quality of the results can reach 89%, 93% and 83% respectively, indicating that the proposed approach is applicable for urban road extraction. We also analyzed the sensitivity of our algorithm to different ant colony optimization parameter values. Comparison of the achieved results with the results of four state-of-the-art algorithms and quantifying the robustness of the fuzzy rule set demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and transferable to other comparable images. © 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Lightweight Encryption Assisted Man-In-The-Middle Attack-Resilient Steganography Model For Secure Satellite Imagery Services: Lemars,"The role of communication technologies has become increasingly vital in various fields such as industrial communication, surveillance and monitoring, healthcare, and data communication, leading to a surge in demand for these technologies in recent years. In this research paper, the LEMARS model is proposed as a novel and robust lightweight encryption assisted Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attack-resilient steganography model for secure satellite imagery services. The proposed solution combines lightweight encryption and attack-resilient embedding to achieve higher attack-resilience with low computational cost and optimal reconstruction quality. The use of Feistel architecture-driven substitution and permutation-based block-cipher encryption and heuristic-driven pixel adjustment method for MITM-Adaptive B-Channel Embedding results in higher imperceptibility and superior attack-resilience under uncertain channels. The strategic amalgamation of FSPN-BCE, L2D-IWT, and HD-OMABE enabled attack-resilient steganography for secure satellite communication. The performance of LEMARS has been evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), entropy, Non-Parametric Change Rate (NPCR), Unified Average Change Intensity (UACI), and regular and singular block pattern changes. LEMARS achieved a PSNR value of 58.02 dB, an entropy value of 6.15 dB, an NPCR value of 99.84%, a UACI value of 33.70, and exhibited minimal block pattern changes. These results indicate that the proposed model achieved higher attack-resilience with low computational cost and optimal reconstruction quality. The research aimed to improve encryption and embedding methods to achieve an MITM-attack resilient embedding solution for secure satellite imagery services. The proposed LEMARS model exhibited superiority over other state-of-the-art methods, affirming the robustness of the proposed LEMARS model for real-time multimedia data security purposes, including remote sensing, satellite imagery services, telemedicine, and EHR. In conclusion, the LEMARS model offers an optimal solution for multimedia data security, combining lightweight encryption and attack-resilient embedding to achieve higher attack-resilience with low computational cost and optimal reconstruction quality. © 2023 - IOS Press.

Technical Note: Use Of Avhrr Imagery In Arctic Marine Mammal Research,"Remote sensing has traditionally been afforded only limited use in Arctic marine mammal research. This is primarily because the summers arc short and often cloud covered; winters are long and solar illumination is limited to a few hours of twilight. Orbital sensors operating on a repeat cycle of 16 days simply do not offer the biologist a sufficiently reliable tool for habitat assessment studies. Compounding the data availability problem was the substantial entry cost to acquire and interpret digital remote sensing imagery. With the increase in computational power of microcomputers and the increasing availability of orbital remote sensing imagery {both the decreasing costs and increase in the number of available sensors) the utility of orbital platforms for Arctic marine mammal research should be re-examined. This review describes the activities of the Marine Mammal Management section of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Central and Arctic Region, specifically relating to the use of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radi¬ometer (AVHRR) imagery in support of marine mammal aerial survey programs. NOAA offers inexpensive timely imagery which can be interpreted on a variety of microcomputer platforms, which are well within the financial means of the marine mammal biologist’s budget. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431169208904033,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Methods For Environmental And Economic Accounting For The Exploitation Of Wild Fish Stocks And Their Applications To The Case Of Icelandic Fisheries,The paper discusses methods for estimating the value of commercially exploited fish stocks and the cost of exploiting them. Methods which are recommended in the System of National Accounting (SNA) satellite system and the System for Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) and relevant for this task are discussed. The paper questions the relevance of some of these methods. It argues for the integration of economic accounting for wild fish stocks with estimation of efficient management of them. Using biological and economic data makes it possible to produce consistent estimates of the value of fish stocks and the cost of exploiting them. These estimates are useful for national accounting and for guiding management of fisheries. This method allows estimation of the cost of inefficiency of fisheries management besides estimation of the cost of depletion. The different methods are illustrated using data on commercial fisheries in Iceland and the fish stocks that they exploit. It is shown that even if all methods are based on market valuation and use only objective data they lead to very different outcomes.,NA,NA,10.1007/s10640-005-2176-5,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Ceos Visualization Environment (Cove) Tool For Intercalibration Of Satellite Instruments,"Increasingly, data from multiple instruments are used to gain a more complete understanding of land surface processes at a variety of scales. Intercalibration, comparison, and coordination of satellite instrument coverage areas is a critical effort of international and domestic space agencies and organizations. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Visualization Environment (COVE) is a suite of browser-based applications that leverage Google Earth to display past, present, and future satellite instrument coverage areas and coincident calibration opportunities. This forecasting and ground coverage analysis and visualization capability greatly benefits the remote sensing calibration community in preparation for multisatellite ground calibration campaigns or individual satellite calibration studies. COVE has been developed for use by a broad international community to improve the efficiency and efficacy of such calibration planning efforts, whether those efforts require past, present, or future predictions.

Optimal Mission Planning Of Geo On-Orbit Refueling In Mixed Strategy,"The mission planning of GEO on-orbit refueling (OOR) in Mixed strategy is studied in this paper. Specifically, one SSc will be launched to an orbital slot near the depot when multiple GEO satellites are reaching their end of lives. The SSc replenishes fuel from the depot and then extends the lifespan of the target satellites via refueling. In the mixed scenario, only some of the target satellites could be served by the SSc, and the remaining ones will be fueled by Pseudo SScs (the target satellite which has already been refueled by the SSc and now has sufficient fuel for its operation as well as the fuel to refuel other target satellites is called Pseudo SSc here). The mission sequences and fuel mass of the SSc and Pseudo SScs, the dry mass of the SSc are used as design variables, whereas the economic benefit of the whole mission is used as design objective. The economic cost and benefit models are stated first, and then a mathematical optimization model is proposed. A comprehensive solution method involving enumeration, particle swarm optimization and modification is developed. Numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and solution method. Economic efficiencies of different OOR strategies are compared and discussed. The mixed strategy would perform better than the other strategies only when the target satellites satisfy some conditions. This paper presents an available mixed strategy scheme for users and analyzes its advantages and disadvantages by comparing with some other OOR strategies, providing helpful references to decision makers. The best strategy in practical applications depends on the specific demands and user preference.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.01.012,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Weakly Supervised Deep Learning For Segmentation Of Remote Sensing Imagery,"Accurate automated segmentation of remote sensing data could benefit applications from land cover mapping and agricultural monitoring to urban development surveyal and disaster damage assessment. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when segmenting natural images with huge labeled datasets, their successful translation to remote sensing tasks has been limited by low quantities of ground truth labels, especially fully segmented ones, in the remote sensing domain. In this work, we perform cropland segmentation using two types of labels commonly found in remote sensing datasets that can be considered sources of ""weak supervision"": (1) labels comprised of single geotagged points and (2) image-level labels. We demonstrate that (1) a U-Net trained on a single labeled pixel per image and (2) a U-Net image classifier transferred to segmentation can outperform pixel-level algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. While the high performance of neural networks is well-established for large datasets, our experiments indicate that U-Nets trained on weak labels outperform baseline methods with as few as 100 labels. Neural networks, therefore, can combine superior classification performance with efficient label usage, and allow pixel-level labels to be obtained from image labels. © 2020 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs12020207,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Cognitive Soil Digital Twin For Monitoring The Soil Ecosystem: A Conceptual Framework,"The digital twin concept has found widespread application across diverse industries. Herein, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework for the cognitive soil digital twin, which embodies the intricate physical reality of the soil ecosystem, aiding in its holistic monitoring and comprehension. The digital twin can seamlessly integrate a multitude of sensor data sources, including field Internet of Things sensors, remote sensing data, field measurements, digital cartography, surveys, and other Earth observation datasets. By virtue of its duality, this digital counterpart facilitates data organisation and rigorous analytical exploration, unravelling the intricacies of physical, chemical, and biological soil constituents while discerning their intricate interrelationships and their impact on ecosystem services. Its potential extends beyond mere data representation, acting as a versatile tool for scenario analysis and enabling the visualisation of diverse environmental impacts, including the effects of climate change and transformations in land use or management practices. Beyond academic circles, the digital twin's utility extends to a broad spectrum of stakeholders across the entire quadruple helix, encompassing farmers and agronomists, soil researchers, the agro-industry, and policy-makers. By fostering collaboration among these stakeholders, the digital twin catalyses informed decision-making, underpinned by data-driven insights. Moreover, it acts as a testbed for the development of innovative sensors and monitoring frameworks, in addition to providing a platform that can educate users and the broader public using immersive and innovative visualisation tools, such as augmented reality. This innovative framework underscores the imperative of a holistic approach to soil ecosystem monitoring and management, propelling the soil science discipline into an era of unprecedented data integration and predictive modelling, by harnessing the effects of climate change towards the development of efficient decision-making.",NA,NA,10.3390/soilsystems7040088,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Building Change Detection In Remote Sensing Imagery With Focal Self-Attention And Multi-Level Feature Fusion,"Accurate and intelligent building change detection greatly contributes to effective urban development, optimized resource management, and informed decision-making in domains such as urban planning, land management, and environmental monitoring. Existing methodologies face challenges in effectively integrating local and global features for accurate building change detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that uses focal self-attention to process the feature vector of input images, which uses a ""focusing"" mechanism to guide the calculation of the self-attention mechanism. By focusing more on critical areas when processing image features in different regions, focal self-attention can better handle both local and global information, and is more flexible and adaptive than other methods, improving detection accuracy. In addition, our multi-level feature fusion module groups the features and then constructs a hierarchical residual structure to fuse the grouped features. On the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets, our proposed method achieved F1-scores of 91.62\% and 89.45\%, respectively. Compared with existing methods, ours performed better on building change detection tasks. Our method therefore provides a framework for solving problems related to building change detection, with some reference value and guiding significance.",NA,NA,10.3390/electronics12132796,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Spatially Explicit Representation Of State-And-Transition Models,"The broad-scale assessment of natural resource conditions (e.g., rangeland health, restoration needs) requires knowledge of their spatial distribution. We argue that creating a database that links state-and-transition models (STMs) to spatial units is a valuable management tool for structuring ground-based observations, management planning for landscapes, and for housing information on the responses of land areas to management actions. To address this need, we introduce a multifactor classification system based on ecological sites and STMs that is directly linked to recent concepts of vegetation dynamics in rangelands. We describe how this classification was used as a basis for creating a spatial database and maps of ecological states. We provide an example of how the classification and mapping has been applied in over 1.2 million ha of public rangelands in southern New Mexico using aerial photo interpretation supplemented with existing inventory data and rapid field assessments. The resulting state map has been used by the Bureau of Land Management: 1) to design landscape-level shrub control efforts, 2) to structure and report district-wide rangeland health assessments, and 3) to evaluate locations for energy development. We conclude by discussing options for the development of state maps and their current limitations, including the use of satellite imagery and concepts for defining states. We argue that cataloging ecological states in a spatial context has clear benefits for rangeland managers because it connects STM concepts to specific land areas. State mapping provides a means to generate and store spatially explicit data resulting from tests of the propositions in STMs and conservation practices.",NA,NA,10.2111/rem-d-11-00047.1,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Effects Of New Energy Vehicle Subsidies On Air Quality: Evidence From China,"Automobile exhaust emissions cause detrimental effect to human health by polluting air. The promotion of new energy vehicles (NEVs) to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions for human health has become an important tool to fight against air pollution. This paper examines the causal relationship between the NEV subsidies in China and air quality through a two-way fixed effects model and a theoretical model. Combining data on staggered prefecture-level city implementation of the subsidies with remote-sensing daily PM2.5 concentration data, we show that the subsidies for NEVs in China significantly improved air quality. The subsidy of NEVs in the private sector (EVPV) reduced PM2.5 concentration by 3\% for the current year and 3.2\% two years after. In particular, the effect of the EVPV implemented two years after increases by 5.7\% with an additional 10,000 people, in-creases by 3.1\% with an additional million civilian cars, increases by 0.3\% with another one key corporation related to NEVs existed in the city, and in medium city, large city, megacity and megalopolis is significantly positive on air quality as compared with that in small city. In addition, the EVPV implemented for the current year and two years after reduce PM2.5 concentration by an additional 1.6\% and 3.4\% if air quality worsens by 25\% in the city, respectively. The subsidy of NEVs in the public sector (EVPB) increased PM2.5 concentration by 4.3\% for the one-year lead and reduced PM2.5 concentration by 5\% for the current year of the policy imple-mentation. The year before implementation of the EVPB significantly increases PM2.5 concentration in medium city, large city and megacity and the EVPB implemented for the current year reduces PM2.5 concentration by an additional 3.2\% if air quality worsens by 25\% in the city. Driving and purchasing restrictions have significant impact on the causal relationship of the EVPB on air quality. Our results remain robust through a series of robustness tests. By developing a theoretical model, we analyze the effect of subsidy policy on air quality as a supplement for empirical results and compare the optimal subsidy intensities for NEVs from the perspectives of consumer surplus, emissions and social welfare. The results indicate that the cost of subsidy policies is lower at the initial stage of the promotion of NEVs, while when consumers begin to accept NEVs widely, the cost of the subsidy policies will increase accordingly.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.eneco.2023.106624,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Darts 2000 Online Diabetes Management System: Formative Evaluation In Clinical Practice,"Rationale, aims and objectives Failure to engage in user-informed evaluation of emergent health informatics tools can have negative consequences for future implementation, related both to poor usability or clinical utility and to suboptimal stakeholder buy-in. This paper describes a formative evaluation in primary care of a multifaceted, web-based resource for diabetes management. The primary aims were to assess the usability and utility of the prototype in order to inform system refinements prior to implementation, and to investigate barriers and facilitators to system use so as to aid the development of a tailored implementation plan. Methods A mixed-method approach involving survey, remote observation, semi-structured interviews and electronic feedback. Context One Scottish local health care cooperative comprising five general practice surgeries and their staff. Results A survey following temporary exposure to a dummy site revealed high levels of computer familiarity, welcoming attitudes and positive ratings of usability, format and utility. Comments mainly addressed content accuracy, feature suggestions and usability issues. Key barriers and facilitators to use included time and training. Remote observation following access to live clinical data enabled profiling of usage by individual and professional group. In the 3 month observation period administrators were the most frequent users, followed by GPs and nurses, with clinical and data entry screens accessed most often. Semi-structured interviews with key respondents sampled by professional group and usage frequency provided richer qualitative information on barriers and facilitators to use, patterns of system integration into work routines and system usability, content and utility. Content analysis of electronic feedback revealed mainly technical queries and general expressions of satisfaction.

An Inexpensive Satellite-Download Gps Receiver For Wildlife: Field Trial On Black Swans,"Context. Knowledge of the movements and space-use patterns of wildlife is crucial for implementation of effective conservation and management actions. Such information can be difficult to obtain, especially from hard-to-capture or far-ranging taxa. Global-positioning-system (GPS) receivers that have remote data-acquisition capability via satellite-communication networks offer an effective means of tracking highly mobile animals; however, often the equipment and operational costs of these devices are prohibitive. Aim. To evaluate the operational performance and potential of an inexpensive, commercially available satellite-download GPS receiver that can be easily modified for use on wildlife, and to demonstrate its utility for revealing novel information on individual animal movements in an important wildlife management context. Methods. We added external batteries and supplementary waterproofing to 'off-the-shelf' SPOT Trace (R) GPS receivers (similar to\$120 USD; Spot LLC, Covington, LA) that transmit recorded location data to users through the Globalstar satellite network. We then deployed these devices on eight wild black swans (Cygnus atratus) inhabiting a large inland marine harbor adjacent to Auckland International Airport and assessed the GPS units' operational performance and overall cost effectiveness. Key results. During field trials with the tracking devices lasting up to 25 days we were able to collect thousands of precision location observations from the swans without the need for recapture. Cost-per-fix was only similar to\$0.04 USD - up to an order of magnitude lower than some satellite-download GPS receivers manufactured specifically for wildlife. We provide novel information about the swans' patterns of activity, movement, space-use, habitat preferences and responses to actions taken by airport staff to scare problem individuals from threat zones. Conclusions. User-modified satellite-download GPS devices can be a highly cost-effective means of tracking the movements of animals. Implications. Knowledge of where and when swans present the greatest likely threat to air traffic and how they respond to displacement from restricted areas near the airport will be useful in devising threat-management plans. The ready availability of affordable remote-download GPS receivers will provide many new opportunities to study the movement and/or space-use patterns of wildlife and incorporate such information into a broad range of research and management programs.",NA,NA,10.1071/wr17064,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Time For Tools: A Review On Geospatial Tools And Their Role In Co-Management,"The overall goal of this study was to conduct an extensive literature review to characterize how geospatial tools are being applied in co-management contexts globally. This was accomplished through two objectives: (i) to investigate the use and applications of geospatial tools in cases of natural resource co-management; and (ii) to identify benefits and challenges associated with the use of these technologies. A total of 26 articles met the inclusion criteria for review; these encompassed a range of contexts, but were predominantly focused on co-management of fisheries, protected areas, and forests. Case studies were analyzed through the lens of four tool-based categories: participatory mapping, spatial data collection, remote sensing, and modelling. Findings suggest a wide range of applications, demonstrating the versatility of these tools including those used to measure the efficacy of co-management. Frequently cited geospatial tool benefits included identifying space-use patterns, determining the state of resources, capacity building, and monitoring change over time. Challenges with geospatial tools included issues of scale and generalization, data uncertainty, incomplete or poor data, and lack of trust. A primary conclusion from this study is that geospatial tools tend to be used in a participatory fashion, thereby contributing to key elements of co-management such as trust building and knowledge co-production.",NA,NA,10.1111/cag.12552,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Aerial Alarm Calling By Male Fowl (Gallus Gallus) Reveals Subtle New Mechanisms Of Risk Management,"Alarm calling is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. Although a signaller may increase the likelihood of survival for group members, which typically include kin and mates, there are inherent risks associated with any behaviour that increases conspicuousness to predators. Callers can increase their indirect benefits by calling only in the presence of an appropriate audience and manage concomitant costs by judicious investment. Possible tactics for controlling costs include facultative variation in call structure and timing, as well as sensitivity to the environmental and social factors that predict personal vulnerability. We examined individual variation in the alarm-calling behaviour of male fowl in naturalistic social groups. Previous studies of cost management have focused on variation at the level of alarm call rate. We took advantage of recent advances in wireless sound recording and remote video monitoring to test for more subtle variation in signal structure and timing. These were then mapped onto individual mating success and moment-to-moment changes in environmental and social context. Results replicate the previous finding that alarm calling is sensitive to both social rank and recent mating success. In addition, we detected systematic variation in call structure as a function of personal vulnerability and proximity to a rival male. The frequency bandwidth of alarms was reliably influenced by degree of vigilance prior to calling, suggesting that this acoustic dimension reflects motivational state. Taken together, these results reveal several novel tactics for risk management, complementing those previously described at the level of gross variation in alarm-calling behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The Efficacy Of Remote Sensing In Quantifying Natural Water Sources In The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument,"The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) was established by Presidential Proclamation in 1996. The GSENM management plan identified determining the status of natural water sources and their ability to support wildlife species as a priority. The arid, rugged terrain of the GSENM limited the utility of conducting ground surveys to accomplish this task. Given the technological advancements in remote sensing (RS), monument managers were interested in learning if this new technology could be used to quantify natural water sources. We conducted this study to determine if satellite imagery and predictive Geographic Information Systems (GIS) models could accomplish this task. To conduct this research, we established training sites at known GSENM natural water sources. We used these training sites to identify areas on satellite imagery that exhibited similar spectral characteristics. These sites were subsequently ground-truthed. We found water sources at only 3 of 36 sites predicted (8% efficiency). Limitations of the RS/GIS techniques employed in this study included imagery resolution, water-source size, and geographic shadowing.",NA,NA,10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[637:teorsi]2.0.co;2,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Emergency Response With Mobile Geosocial Sensing In The Post-App Era,"Disaster and emergency management is inherently a spatial problem. In case of disaster, the use of real-time location-based social media posts within the spatial decision support processes has great potential so that resource distribution can be planned, damage areas can be determined, the amount of damage can be estimated, and evacuation and/or help routes can be defined. Crowdsourced data and collaborative platforms like OpenStreetMap and Twitter can be widely employed for near-real-time mapping to support emergency management. After a disaster occurs, the aim is to quickly assess and triage damage, injury, and loss of life, and respond with medicine, food, water, housing, and basic infrastructure. In the scope of the study, in a similar manner, a solution, called WITNER, is proposed, designed, and developed. The difference is that WITNER is a cloud-native geo-enabled solution. The value of WITNER lies in the fact that it acts only as a mediator in translating help requests posted on a social media platform into spatially readable form, while keeping original social media post requests intact and accessible. The main purpose of WITNER is to help more people and save more lives in case of emergency response, with the intention of preventing the same help request locations being concurrently targeted by multiple relief, search, and rescue efforts. Moreover, it reveals more viable and less costly help requests that might take less time for potential help providers to assist with. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",NA,NA,10.1111/tgis.12706,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Incorporating Environmental Variables Into A Modis-Based Crop Yield Estimation Method For United States Corn And Soybeans Through The Use Of A Random Forest Regression Algorithm,"Satellite-based remote sensing is a powerful form of technology that can provide food security policy makers with reliable information. This information allows them to estimate final crop yields on a global scale within reasonable time frames and with higher spatial resolution than with the use of pure statistical data. Satellite-based crop yield estimation methods are commonly based on the high correlation between the crop yield and the vegetation index (VI), taken at a specific phenological stage. Although VI-based crop yield estimation methods that make use of one approximation formula can easily and effectively estimate the spatial distribution of corn and soybean yields in the United States, there are still some associated drawbacks to this approach that result in the underestimation of crop yields, especially in irrigated regions. Furthermore, a fundamental problem with this approach is the difficulty in evaluation of environmental stress-related physiological disorders such as sterility, which cannot be evaluated based on VIs as an alternative value to biomass. This study's objective was, thus, to overcome the limitations associated with the conventional approach by incorporating additional environmental variables into the proposed method along with the application of a random forest regression algorithm for estimating United States (US) corn and soybean yields with higher accuracy.This study compared three methods: (1) a conventional method based on a linear regression model (LM method) calibrated using limited past data, (2) a method, which was slightly altered from the LM method in terms of the use of a polynomial regression model (PM method), and (3) the newly proposed method, which involved the application of a random forest regression algorithm and the use of irrigated harvested cropland percentage and reanalysis data for temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, and soil moisture (RF method). The time-series correlation between the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) wide dynamic ranged vegetation index (WDRVI) and corn and soybean yields were analyzed as part of a preliminary investigation to determine the best time for recording the MODIS WDRVI as an explanatory variable in the study area. The results revealed that the MODIS WDRVI demonstrated the highest correlation with county-level statistical yields 13 days before the silking stage for corn and 6 days before the setting pods stage for soybeans. The regression formulas for the LM and the PM method were developed based on assigning the MODIS WDRVI to these phenological stages as explanatory variables. The advantage of the PM method over the LM method was found to be its adaptability to high-yield counties because of the inherent effect of using a polynomial regression equation. The LM method, which made use of a linear regression equation calibrated using limited past data (2009-2010), could not be adapted to increased yields encountered in recent years without recalibration with the latest data. The RF method learning models were individually optimized for each state and crop. This optimization revealed, that our learning model that incorporated every available variable did not always perform best, probably due to overfitting. In the major irrigated states of Kansas, and Nebraska, the spatial data of the percentage of irrigated harvested cropland improve the estimation accuracy of the RF method for both corn and soybean. In the states of Illinois and Iowa, the RF method, which incorporated primarily the weather-related variables of soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, and shortwave radiation, improved the estimation accuracy due to a response of rainfed agriculture to environmental stress. This is especially true for soybean. The validation results indicated that the estimation accuracy of the RF method (root mean square error RMSE: 0.539 t/ha for corn, 0.206 t/ha for soybeans) was higher than that of the PM method (RMSE: 0.897 t/ha for corn, 0.283 t/ha for soybeans) at the state level, particularly due to the effect of bias correction in irrigated regions.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.12.012,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
The Satellite Images Matching And Mosaic Techniques,"The Matching and Mosaic of the satellite imagery play an essential role in many remote sensing and image processing projects. These techniques must be required in a particular step in the project, such as remotely change detection applications and the study of large regions of interest. The matching and mosaic methods depend on many image parameters such as pixel values in the two or more images, projection system associated with the header files, and spatial resolutions, where many of these methods construct the matching and mosaic manually. In this research, georeference techniques were used to overcome the image matching task in semi automotive method. The decision about the quality of the technique can be considered if the error value is less than half a pixel. The projection-based method was used to ensure the mosaic process. The test images are satellite imagery with medium spatial resolutions; these images were processed to ensure the results. In matching techniques, the different sensor images (different in resolutions) were investigated using image resize and sampling. The results were obtained using many remote sensing packages and written programs in Matlab environmental. © 2023 University of Baghdad-College of Science.

21st Century Planning Techniques For Creating Fire-Resilient Forests In The American West,"Data-driven decision making is the key to providing effective and efficient wildfire protection and sustainable use of natural resources. Due to the complexity of natural systems, management decision(s) require clear justification based on substantial amounts of information that are both accurate and precise at various spatial scales. To build information and incorporate it into decision making, new analytical frameworks are required that incorporate innovative computational, spatial, statistical, and machine-learning concepts with field data and expert knowledge in a manner that is easily digestible by natural resource managers and practitioners. We prototyped such an approach using function modeling and batch processing to describe wildfire risk and the condition and costs associated with implementing multiple prescriptions for risk mitigation in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, USA. Three key aspects of our approach included: (1) spatially quantifying existing fuel conditions using field plots and Sentinel 2 remotely sensed imagery; (2) spatially defining the desired future conditions with regards to fuel objectives; and (3) developing a cost/revenue assessment (CRA). Each of these components resulted in spatially explicit surfaces describing fuels, treatments, wildfire risk, costs of implementation, projected revenues associated with the removal of tree volume and biomass, and associated estimates of model error. From those spatially explicit surfaces, practitioners gain unique insights into tradeoffs among various described prescriptions and can further weigh those tradeoffs against financial and logistical constraints. These types of datasets, procedures, and comparisons provide managers with the information needed to identify, optimize, and justify prescriptions across the landscape. © 2021 by the authors.

Achieving Real-Time Path Planning In Unknown Environments Through Deep Neural Networks,"Real-time path planning is crucial for intelligent vehicles to achieve autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based method for real-time online path planning in unknown cluttered environments. Firstly, an end-to-end DNN architecture named online three-dimensional path planning network (OTDPP-Net) is designed to learn 3D local path planning policies. It determines actions in 3D space based on multiple value iteration computations approximated by recurrent 2D convolutional neural networks. Moreover, a path planning framework is also developed to realize near-optimal real-time online path planning. The effectiveness of the proposed planner is further improved by a switching scheme, and the path quality is optimized by line-of-sight checks. Both virtual and real-world experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed DNN-based path planner in terms of efficiency, success rate and path quality. Different from existing methods, the computational time and effectiveness of the developed DNN-based path planner are both independent of environmental conditions, which reveals its superiority in large-scale complex environments.

A Spatio-Temporal Encoding Neural Network For Semantic Segmentation Of Satellite Image Time Series,"Remote sensing image semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in various fields, such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and agricultural land classification. However, most current research primarily focuses on utilizing the spatial and spectral information of single-temporal remote sensing images, neglecting the valuable temporal information present in historical image sequences. In fact, historical images often contain valuable phenological variations in land features, which exhibit diverse patterns and can significantly benefit from semantic segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a semantic segmentation framework for satellite image time series (SITS) based on dilated convolution and a Transformer encoder. The framework includes spatial encoding and temporal encoding. Spatial encoding, utilizing dilated convolutions exclusively, mitigates the loss of spatial accuracy and the need for up-sampling, while allowing for the extraction of rich multi-scale features through a combination of different dilation rates and dense connections. Temporal encoding leverages a Transformer encoder to extract temporal features for each pixel in the image. To better capture the annual periodic patterns of phenological phenomena in land features, position encoding is calculated based on the image's acquisition date within the year. To assess the performance of this framework, comparative and ablation experiments were conducted using the PASTIS dataset. The experiments indicate that this framework achieves highly competitive performance with relatively low optimization parameters, resulting in an improvement of 8 percentage points in the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).",NA,NA,10.3390/app132312658,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Machine-Learning Model To Delineate Sub-Surface Agricultural Drainage From Satellite Imagery,"Knowing subsurface drainage (tile-drain) extent is integral to understanding how landscapes respond to precipitation events and subsequent days of drying, as well as how soil characteristics and land management influence stream response. Consequently, a time series of tile-drain extent would inform one aspect of land management that complicates our ability to explain streamflow and water-quality as a function of climate variability or conservation management. We trained a UNet machine-learning model, a convolutional neural network designed to highlight objects of interest within an image, to delineate tile-drain networks in panchromatic satellite imagery without additional data on soils, topography, or historical tile-drain extent. This was done by training the model to match the accuracy of human experts manually tracing the surface representation of tile drains in satellite imagery. Our approach began with a library of images that were used to train and quantify the accuracy of the model, with model performance tested on imagery from two areas that were not used to train the model. Satellite imagery included acquisition dates from 2008 to 2020. Training imagery was from agricultural areas within the US Great Lakes basin. Validation imagery was from the upper Maumee River, tributary to western Lake Erie, and an Indiana, Ohio-River headwater tributary. Our analysis of the satellite imagery paired with meteorological and soil data found that during spring, a combination of relatively high solar radiation, intermediate soil-water content and bare fields enabled the best model performance. Each area of interest was heavily tile-drained, where better understanding the movement of water, nutrients, and sediment from fields to downstream water bodies is key to managing harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The trained UNet model successfully identified tile drains visible in the validation imagery with an accuracy of 93\%-96\% and balanced accuracy of 52\%-54\%, similar to performance for training data (95\% and 63\%, respectively). Model performance will benefit from ongoing contributions to the training library.",NA,NA,10.1002/jeq2.20493,excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Use-Specific Considerations For Optimising Data Quality Trade-Offs In Citizen Science: Recommendations From A Targeted Literature Review To Improve The Usability And Utility For The Calibration And Validation Of Remotely Sensed Products,"The growth of citizen science presents a valuable potential source of calibration and validation data for environmental remote sensing at greater spatial and temporal scales, and with greater cost efficiency than is achievable by professional in situ reference-data collection alone. However, the frequent mismatch between in situ data-quality requirements for remote-sensing-product development and current data quality assurance in citizen science presents a significant challenge if widespread use of these complementary data sources is to be achieved. To evaluate the scope of this challenge, we conducted a targeted literature review into the nature of data-quality issues faced by citizen-science projects for routine incorporation into terrestrial environmental-monitoring systems. From the literature, we identify the challenges and trade-offs to inform best-practice implementation of data quality assurance in citizen-science projects. To assist practitioners in implementing our findings, we grouped these themes by stage of citizen-science project: (1) program planning and design; (2) participant engagement; (3) data collection; and (4) data processing. As a final step, we used our findings as the basis to formulate guiding questions that can be used to inform decision making when choosing optimal data-quality-improvement and assurance strategies for use of citizen science in remote-sensing calibration and/or validation.

The Utility Of Spaceborne Radar To Render Flood Inundation Maps Based On Multialgorithm Ensembles,"On December 12, 2006, both the European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 and Environmental Satellite recorded a high-magnitude flood event on the River Dee in Wales (U. K.) only 28 min apart. This unique opportunity enables the creation of a very rare but extremely useful observed data set for flood inundation studies. For flood management purposes, hydrodynamic models are often run after an event but with field data gauged during the event to approximate both flood area and depth. As an adequate a priori definition of model parameters is difficult, they tend to be run with multiple parameter sets to generate a likelihood of inundation map. However, as field observations of events are often very scarce, these output maps cannot be validated with field-observed probabilities. This paper illustrates how this unique set of spaceborne radar images can be used in combination with five widely used image processing techniques to generate an event-specific inundation map that expresses a degree of belief that a given pixel is possibly flooded. It is expected that the value of this multialgorithm ensemble-based map opens up new ways to evaluate the performance of hydrodynamic models, as it contains information which has, to the authors' knowledge, not previously been available.",NA,NA,10.1109/tgrs.2009.2017937,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Evaluating The Effectiveness Of Air Quality Regulations: A Review Of Accountability Studies And Frameworks,"Assessments of past environmental policiestermed accountability studiescontribute important information to the decision-making process used to review the efficacy of past policies, and subsequently aid in the development of effective new policies. These studies have used a variety of methods that have achieved varying levels of success at linking improvements in air quality and/or health to regulations. The Health Effects Institute defines the air pollution accountability framework as a chain of events that includes the regulation of interest, air quality, exposure/dose, and health outcomes, and suggests that accountability research should address impacts for each of these linkages. Early accountability studies investigated short-term, local regulatory actions (for example, coal use banned city-wide on a specific date or traffic pattern changes made for Olympic Games). Recent studies assessed regulations implemented over longer time and larger spatial scales. Studies on broader scales require accountability research methods that account for effects of confounding factors that increase over time and space. Improved estimates of appropriate baseline levels (sometimes termed counterfactualthe expected state in a scenario without an intervention) that account for confounders and uncertainties at each link in the accountability chain will help estimate causality with greater certainty. In the direct accountability framework, researchers link outcomes with regulations using statistical methods that bypass the link-by-link approach of classical accountability. Direct accountability results and methods complement the classical approach. New studies should take advantage of advanced planning for accountability studies, new data sources (such as satellite measurements), and new statistical methods. Evaluation of new methods and data sources is necessary to improve investigations of long-term regulations, and associated uncertainty should be accounted for at each link to provide a confidence estimate of air quality regulation effectiveness. The final step in any accountability is the comparison of results with the proposed benefits of an air quality policy.Implications: The field of air pollution accountability continues to grow in importance to a number of stakeholders. Two frameworks, the classical accountability chain and direct accountability, have been used to estimate impacts of regulatory actions, and both require careful attention to confounders and uncertainties. Researchers should continue to develop and evaluate both methods as they investigate current and future air pollution regulations.",NA,NA,10.1080/10962247.2016.1242518,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Temporal Mixture Analysis For Estimating Impervious Surface Area From Multi-Temporal Modis Ndvi Data In Japan,"As a proxy measure of the human ecological footprint, impervious surface area (ISA) has recently become a key concept in the field of urban remote sensing, with a focus on estimation of the ISA at a city-scale by using Landsat-style satellite images. However, ISA estimation is also in demand in disciplines such as the environmental assessment and policy making at a national scale. This paper proposes a new method for estimating the ISA fraction in Japan based on a temporal mixture analysis (TMA) technique. The required inputs for the proposed method are rearranged MODIS NDVI time-series datasets at the temporal stable zone (i.e., the first to the sixth largest NDVI values in a year). Three ISA distribution maps obtained from Landsat-5 TM data were used as reference maps to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed TMA-based method achieved a large reduction in the effects of endmember variability compared with the previous methods (e.g., SMA and NSMA), and thus the new method has promising accuracy for estimating ISA in Japan. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed method was 8.7\%, with a coefficient of determination of 0.86, and there was no obvious underestimation or overestimation for the whole ISA range.

Reduced Medical Spending Associated With Increased Use Of A Remote Diabetes Management Program And Lower Mean Blood Glucose Values,"Aims: Many new mobile technologies are available to assist people in managing chronic conditions, but data on the association between the use of these technologies and medical spending remains limited. As the available digital technology offerings to aid in diabetes management increase, it is important to understand their impact on medical spending. The aim of this study was to investigate the financial impact of a remote digital diabetes management program using medical claims and real-time blood glucose data. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of multivariate difference-in-difference and instrumental variables regression modeling was performed using data collected from a remote digital diabetes management program. All employees with diabetes were invited, in a phased introduction, to join the program. Data included blood glucose (BG) values captured remotely from members via connected BG meters and medical spending claims. Participants included members (those who accepted the invitation, n = 2,261) and non-members (n = 8,741) who received health insurance benefits from three self-insured employers. Medical spending was compared between people with well-controlled (BG ≤ 154 mg/dL) and poorly controlled (BG > 154 mg/dL) diabetes. Results: Program access was associated with a 21.9% (p < 0.01) decrease in medical spending, which translates into a $88 saving per member per month at 1 year. Compared to non-members, members experienced a 10.7% (p < 0.01) reduction in diabetes-related medical spending and a 24.6% (p < 0.01) reduction in spending on office-based services. Well-controlled BG values were associated with 21.4% (p = 0.03) lower medical spending. Limitations and conclusions: Remote digital diabetes management is associated with decreased medical spending at 1 year. Reductions in spending increased with active utilization. It will be beneficial for future studies to analyze the long-term effects of the remote diabetes management program and assess impacts on patient health and well-being. © 2019, © 2019 Livongo Health & Eli Lilly and Company.

Analysis Of Deforestation And Protected Area Effectiveness In Indonesia: A Comparison Of Bayesian Spatial Models,"Tropical deforestation in Southeast Asia is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions and reductions of biodiversity. Spatially explicit analyses of the dynamics of deforestation in Indonesia are needed to support sustainable land use planning but the value of such analyses has so far been limited by data availability and geographical scope. We use remote sensing maps of land use change from 2000 to 2010 to compare Bayesian computational models: autologistic and von Thunen spatial-autoregressive models. We use the models to analyze deforestation patterns in Indonesia and the effectiveness of protected areas. Cross-validation indicated that models had an accuracy of 70-85\%. We find that the spatial pattern of deforestation is explained by transport cost, agricultural rent and history of nearby illegal logging. The effectiveness of protected areas presented mixed results. After controlling for multiple confounders, protected areas of category la, exclusively managed for biodiversity conservation, were shown to be ineffective at slowing down deforestation. Our results suggest that monitoring and prevention of road construction within protected areas, using logging concessions as buffers of protected areas and geographical prioritization of control measures in illegal logging hotspots would be more effective for conservation than reliance on protected areas alone, especially under food price increasing scenarios.

Cost–Benefit Assessment For Maintenance Of Urban Green Infrastructure At The University Campus In Moscow: Application Of Greenspaces And Treetalker Technologies To Regulating Ecosystem Services,"Trees are a key element of urban green infrastructure (UGI). They supply a wide range of benefits—ecosystem services—from air purification to places for recreation. UGI is also an expenditure item in the budget due to the investments required for its establishment and maintenance. Accounting for ecosystem services in monetary terms allows considering direct and indirect benefits of green spaces together with costs, has not only implications for decision-making but also could be instrumental in changing landowners’ perceptions of UGI and its importance. In this paper, we used the data from advanced tree monitoring technologies to compare monetary values of regulating ecosystem services to maintenance costs for the case of campus of the People’s Friendship University of Russia (RUDN) in Moscow, Russia. Inventories of UGI elements were conducted by means of a field survey and remote sensing, that resulted in GIS project in GreenSpaces software. The same program was used to keep track of costs of the different types of maintenance work based on information from Greening Department of RUDN. Biophysical parameters of tree functioning were obtained from more than 60 TreeTalker sensors installed on the major species during the two years. The monetary value of four major regulating ecosystem services (air purification, climate regulation, water transpiration, carbon sequestration) of the trees was then assessed, allowing a comparison of the costs for maintenance and some of the benefits derived. The results show that even when considering just monetary value from regulating services, it outweighs the costs for maintenance of the UGI in the amount of 1.5 million rubles or about a quarter of the costs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-3-031-37216-2_22,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Multi-Sensor Modelling Of A Forest Productivity Index For Radiata Pine Plantations,"Background: An understanding of how plantation productivity varies spatially is important for forest planning, management and projection of future plantation yields and returns. The 300 Index is a volume productivity index developed for Pinus radiata D. Don that has been widely used within New Zealand to assess site productivity. Although the 300 Index is routinely characterised at the stand level, little research has investigated if remotely sensed data sources can be used in combination with environmental layers to precisely predict this metric at fine spatial resolution. Methods: This study uses an extensive dataset obtained from P. radiata plantations in the central North Island, New Zealand. Using this dataset, the objective of this research was to compare the precision of parametric and non-parametric models of the 300 Index that included explanatory variables extracted from aerially acquired light detection and ranging (LiDAR), satellite imagery (RapidEye) at 5-m resolution or environmental layers and combinations of these three data sources. Models were constructed both with and without stand age as an explanatory variable as managers may not always have access to stand age. A total of 28 models (14 data sources x two model methods) were constructed using data from 433 plots. Precision and bias of these models was determined using an independent dataset of 60 plots. Results: Of the non-parametric methods tested (k-most similar neighbour (k-MSN), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN)), k-NN using an optimised value of k-most precisely predicted the 300 Index for 11 of the 14 constructed models. The use of k-NN was found to be more precise than parametric models when age was not available but of overall similar precision to parametric models when stand age was available as a predictor. For models including stand age, the inclusion of LiDAR resulted in the most precise model (mean R-2 = 0.789; root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.48 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) while for models without stand age, metrics extracted from both satellite imagery and environmental layers produced the most precise model of the 300 Index (R-2 = 0.65; RMSE = 3.21 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)). Conclusions: Results clearly show that models constructed from LiDAR provide the most precise means of estimating the 300 Index. However, in many situations, LiDAR is too expensive to acquire or stand age, which is used as a reference for linking LiDAR to 300 Index, is not available as an independent variable. Under these circumstances, results show that precise models can be constructed from variables derived from the combination of satellite imagery and environmental surfaces.",NA,NA,10.1186/s40490-016-0065-z,excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
A Deformable Feature Pyramid Network For Ship Detection From Remote Sensing Images,"As a carrier of maritime transportation, the accurate detection of ships is of great significance and value in marine environmental protection, marine fishery production management, maritime traffic and emergency disposal, and national defense security applications. In recent years, the remote sensing ship detection method based on CNN (convolutional neural network) is facing big challenges to adapt to small-scale ships with random orientation and morphological characteristics due to insufficient resolution of the final layer features and convolution fixed geometry, thus reducing the accuracy of object detection. In order to tackle this problem, a remote sensing ship detection method based on deformable feature pyramid network with multi-scale feature fusion. First, the architecture of feature pyramid network is adopted to detect small-scale ship object by using a bottom-up refinement process and multi-scale feature fusion. Then, by introducing the deformable convolution and RoI (region of interest) pooling module to adapt to the ship object with random orientation and morphological characteristics, the ship detection accuracy is further improved.

We calculated an index of present and 1948 functional sector diversity for the entire channel network to highlight past evolutions. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to predict changes in functional sector diversity resulting from defined options of sediment reintroduction through planned forest removal. A similar procedure was developed to evaluate likely changes in brown trout distribution resulting from the impacts of the actions on canopy cover and summer water temperature. The methodological procedure is described, as well as the different assumptions made to move from a theoretical framework to a more practical one.

Sada-Net: A Shape Feature Optimization And Multiscale Context Information-Based Water Body Extraction Method For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significance in remote sensing image mapping, and pixel-level representation allows refined results. Due to inconsistencies within a class and different scales of water bodies, the water body mapping has challenges, such as insufficient integrity and rough shape segmentation. To resolve these issues, we proposed an intelligent water bodies extraction method (named SADA-Net) for high-resolution remote sensing images. This method considers multiscale information, context dependence, and shape features. The network framework integrates three critical components: shape feature optimization (SFO), atrous spatial pyramid pooling, and dual attention modules. SADA-Net can accurately extract an extensive range of water bodies in complex scenarios. SADA-Net has certain advantages regarding small and dense water bodies extraction, as the SFO module effectively solves the defects of the unified processing of low-level features in the encoder stage of CNNs, which highlights the shape information of a water body. Two data types (red, green, and blue bands and multispectral images) are employed to verify the performance of the proposed network. The best result achieved an evaluation index F1-Score of 96.14\% in large-scale image segmentation, and the structural similarity index measure reached 94.70\%.

Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Uav Itinerary Planning For Remote Sensing Applications In Smart Farming,"UAV path planning for remote sensing aims to find the best-fitted routes to complete a data collection mission. UAVs plan the routes and move through them to remotely collect environmental data from particular target zones by using sensory devices such as cameras. Route planning may utilize machine learning techniques to autonomously find/select cost-effective and/or best-fitted routes and achieve optimized results including: minimized data collection delay, reduced UAV power consumption, decreased flight traversed distance and maximized number of collected data samples. This paper utilizes a reinforcement learning technique (location and energy-aware Q-learning) to plan UAV routes for remote sensing in smart farms. Through this, the UAV avoids heuristically or blindly moving throughout a farm, but this takes the benefits of environment exploration-exploitation to explore the farm and find the shortest and most cost-effective paths into target locations with interesting data samples to collect.

These activities provide drought early warning alerts and climate impact assessment to national and international agencies which require such information for disaster preparedness and agricultural assessment purposes.Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) aboard the NOAA polar‐orbiting satellite series have been used operationally in these assessment tasks since 1982. In 1985 and 1986, the use of satellite data has focused on medium resolution Global Area Coverage (GAC) data with an emphasis on the Sahel and Hom countries of Africa.In an operational context, satellite data are received from the Satellite Data Services Division of NOAA on a weekly basis from May through September. These data are processed into images over ten‐day periods in order to remove as many clouds as possible from the scene. They are further processed according to a unique color system designed to maximize their qualitative interpretability. The data are then analyzed on a weekly basis according to their normalized vegetation index (NVI) values as plotted on a spatial/temporal continuum.These satellite data, used in the context of agricultural assessment activities, are represented in two of three subsystems which are used to verify one another in the agricultural assessment process. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,10.1080/10106048709354080,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Lockdowns Save People From Air Pollution: Evidence From Daily Global Tropospheric No2 Satellite Data,"Motivated by the global fear of the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, we investigated whether lockdowns save people from air pollution, notably from Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Using daily satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), we first found that the global NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) decreased by 16.5\% after the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Then, we calculated the global health benefits, as the monetized value of life, using the value of a statistical life (VSL). The total global health benefits were approximately 8.73 trillion USD, accounting for 10\% of the global GDP; such benefits would be the largest in China, followed by the United States, Japan and Germany. Our results suggest that lockdowns may bring benefits to countries that policy interventions cannot easily bring, thus highlighting the importance of social distancing.",NA,NA,10.3390/su132111777,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Estimating Turbulent Fluxes Through Assimilation Of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites Data Using Ensemble Kalman Filter,"In this study, a data assimilation scheme is developed on the basis of the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm and the common land model (CoLM); soil moisture and model parameters are simultaneously optimized to improve the estimates of turbulent fluxes. Land surface temperature (LST) is retrieved from geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES) data, validated, and then assimilated into the model. The data assimilation results are validated at six observation sites in the United States that include grassland, cropland, and forestland cover types. Data assimilation results indicate that in addition to improvements in the prediction of turbulent fluxes, model uncertainties are also reduced as a result of the assimilation of GOES LST retrieval data. The average reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) values are 47.5 and 31.1 W m(-2). The effects of simultaneous optimization of soil moisture and model parameters are compared with those resulting from separate optimization; simultaneous optimization is found to yield smaller RMSE values. Further, in this study, the effects of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GOES temporal resolution data on data assimilation results are studied. The assimilation results indicate that the average RMSE values for GOES temporal resolution data are smaller than that for MODIS temporal resolution data. During the assimilation time period, the soil moisture obtained from assimilation closely agrees with the observed values, and the four vegetation parameters show distinct seasonal variations. However, the lack of sufficient information makes it difficult to estimate the true value of these variables and parameters.",NA,NA,10.1029/2010jd015150,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Exiting Fieldwork ""With Grace"": Reflections On The Unintended Consequences Of Participant Observation And Researcher-Participant Relationships","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the methodological importance of how researchers exit fieldwork to draw attention to implications for participant and researcher well-being. Design/methodology/approach - Reflecting in detail on one researcher's final six-months exiting fieldwork at a retirement village, this paper critically examines the unintended consequences of participant observation and researcher-participant relationships. Findings - The paper illustrates that difficulties to exit fieldwork can be unintended consequences of participant observation activities and developing researcher-participant relationships. The findings also discuss how fieldwork exit can impose upon participant and researcher well-being. Research limitations/implications - The findings are built upon fieldwork at a retirement village where the researcher served as a volunteer. Thus, the discussion focusses on participant observation activities that are likely to lead to close researcher-participant relationships. However, this paper aims to serve as a useful resource for researchers when considering how to exit their unique fieldwork contexts ""with grace"". Practical implications - The paper provides practical suggestions to help marketing researchers such as ethnographers, manage fieldwork exits with participant and researcher well-being concerns in mind. Social implications - The practical suggestions provided by this paper aim to enable marketing researchers to exit fieldwork contexts ""with grace"" through reflection and proactive management of the social impacts of their research activities. Originality/value - Even though researchers acknowledge fieldwork is social and personal by nature, little research attention has been paid to the management of researcher-participant relationships and the exit stage of fieldwork.

Weather Prediction Using Multiple Iot Based Wireless Sensors,"Environmental monitoring has become extremely important due to recent changes in the climate. It is important for ensuring a safe and wealthy life of both humans and artifacts. This field is based on remote sensing and wireless sensor networks for gathering data about the environment. Recent advancements, for example, the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), the distributed computing model, and digital physical frameworks support the transmission and management of huge amounts of data relating to the trends determined in environmental parameters. In this context, the paper presents three different IoT-based wireless sensors for weather prediction and environmental monitoring: one employing User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based Wi-Fi communication, second communicating through Wi-Fi and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and a third one using Bluetooth communication. The system consists of three different wireless sensor nodes based on Node-MCU Wi-Fi module or Arduino microcontroller that is connected to the internet, and a firebase cloud server, which provides information storage and delivery to remote clients. In addition, to view the result output in an effective and user friendly manner, MIT App Inventor is used to develop applications for Android phones using a web browser and either an associated phone or the on-screen phone person.

Content Placement Based On Utility Function For Satellite Networks,"The incorporation of the cognitive radio (CR) technology as a spectrum management tool in satellite communication has attracted considerable research attention because the CR allows the coexistence of the primary and secondary networks using the same resources. In this paper, satellites and their users are considered as a primary network, and the terrestrial base stations (BSs) and their users are considered as a secondary network. Besides, it is considered that terrestrial users cause interference to satellite users due to technical and environmental constraints. This interference reduces satellite users' satisfaction with downloads rate. In such a cognitive satellite network environment, content placement may also cause a decrease in user satisfaction. The successful download probability (SDP) is analyzed in this work based on different terrestrial user density. To utilize the satellite cache resources effectively, we propose two transmission strategies based on the terrestrial user density, namely, the multi-point cooperative transmission strategy (CT) and the parallel transmission strategy (PT). In addition, based on the cache service probability we determine the ratio of content distribution most popular content (MPC) and general popular content (GPC) and optimize the content placement process using the utility function in CT mode. Through computer simulation, we give numerical results of our method. The obtained numerical results show that the proposed strategies are effective in content placement.",NA,NA,10.1109/access.2019.2952104,excluded,"{""No societal value context""}"
Theil-Sen Regressive Miyaguchi-Preneel-Based Cryptographic Hash Blockchain For Secure Data Transmission Using Remote Sensing Data In Iot,"Based on yours suggestion, we have shortened the abstract below 250 words and is mentioned as follows, ""Internet of things (IoT) is the most advanced version of the internet to maintain a number of applications that combines different intelligent devices used by management or individuals, such as remote sensing data processing, smart health with environmental monitoring, and other related fields. IoT devices interact and interfere with one another, posing a variety of security risks. Prior industrial IoT blockchain data transmission methods suffer from lower security, higher management costs for trading centres, and significant supervision challenges. To deal with this issue, Theil-Sen Regressive Miyaguchi-Preneel-based Cryptographic Hash Blockchain approach is proposed in this manuscript for securing data transmission utilizing remote sensing data in IoT (TSR-MPCHB-SDT-RSD).

Tva-Epri River Resource Aid (Terra) Reservoir And Power Operations Decision Support System,"The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) have developed software to assist utilities in coordinating power and reservoir operations while balancing multiple objectives. The INTEGRAL project consists of a Decision Support System (DSS) and a Power and Reservoir System Scheduling Model (PRSYM). The DSS, as tailored to the TVA power and reservoir system, is the TVA-EPRI River Resource Aid (TERRA). TERRA is a decision support system that integrates tracking, display, and modeling tools. TERRA provides historical, current, and forecast data to users at several locations to help resolve problems in operation, forecasting, and planning. Graphical displays are featured for individual power plants and reservoirs and on a system-wide basis. TERRA tracks constraints that affect operations and flags non-compliance. Constraints consist of flow, dissolved oxygen, and temperature limits for regulatory compliance, recreation, lake improvement, and special operations. Numerical models may be run from TERRA to predict water temperatures and flows at selected power plants to aid in reservoir operations to comply with thermal limits and minimum flow requirements. TERRA uses a geographic information system (GIS) background map of the Tennessee River Valley. The TERRA software is adaptable to other reservoir systems by changing the GIS background map and reconfiguring other system features. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",NA,NA,10.1007/bf00619276,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Multi-Objective Optimization Of Communication Satellites With Two-Branch Tournament Genetic Algorithm,"In spacecraft design, many specialized state-of-the-art design tools are employed to optimize the performance of various subsystems. However, there is no structured system-level concept-definition process. Consequently, designers usually compromise some mission goals to satisfy only one of the primary design objectives. The conceptual stage of the spacecraft design process is formulated into a multi-objective discrete optimization problem. The use of multi-objective design allows the designer to evaluate different design alternatives across the whole set of design objectives. This work addresses two key design objectives for the spacecraft design process: the minimization of total launch mass and the maximization of spacecraft overall reliability. To predict values for the objective and constraint functions, a satellite design tool, which includes a satellite sizing model and a deterministic reliability model, was built and integrated with a genetic algorithm that employs a two-branch tournament to address the dual objective problem. The multi-objective approach was successful in determining sets of discrete design parameters that would minimize the launch mass as well as maximize the reliability of a geostationary communication satellite, using specified payload requirements. The designs generated by this approach appear to fall into three regions of the tradeoff space between the satellite launch mass and the satellite reliability objectives.",NA,NA,10.2514/2.3942,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Water Quality Monitoring Of Al-Habbaniyah Lake Using Remote Sensing And In Situ Measurements,"The use of remote sensing and GIS in water monitoring and management has been long recognized. This paper, however discusses the application of remote sensing and GIS specifically in monitoring water quality parameters in Al-Habbaniyah Lake, and the results were compared with in situ measurements. Variations of different parameters under investigation were as follows: temperature (15–33°C), pH (7–9), dissolved oxygen (6-11mg/L), BOD5 (0.5–1.8), electrical conductivity (200–2280 μS/cm), TDS (147–1520 mg/L), TSS (68–3200), turbidity (5–51), nitrate (0.7–20 mg/l), phosphate (77–220 μg/l), and chlorophyll-a (0.9–130 μg/l). Remote sensing results revealed that the band 5 was most likely significantly correlated with turbidity in the winter. Band 2 and 3 was most likely significantly correlated with TDS in autumn and summer, while band 2 was most likely significantly correlated with TSS in autumn, band 2 is most likely significantly correlated with chlorophyll-a in autumn. The current study results demonstrated convergence between in situ and remote sensing readings. The models were used to explore the values of each of chlorophyll-a, TSS,TDS, and turbidity did not deviate much from the values actually measured in the three seasons. Nevertheless, they were very useful in anticipating all seasons of the study due to the insignificant deviation between the remotely sensed values and actual measured values. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-015-4607-2,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Leveraging On Advanced Remote Sensing- And Artificial Intelligence-Based Technologies To Manage Palm Oil Plantation For Current Global Scenario: A Review,"Advanced remote sensing technologies have undoubtedly revolutionized palm oil industry management by bringing business and environmental benefits on a single platform. It is evident from the ongoing trend that remote sensing using satellite and aerial data is able to provide precise and quick information for huge palm oil plantation areas using high-resolution image processing, which is also recognized by the certification agencies, i.e., the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification). A substantial improvement in the palm oil industry could be attained by utilizing the latest Geo-information tools and technologies equipped with AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms and image processing, which could help to identify illegal deforestation, tree count, tree height, and the early detection of diseased leaves. This paper reviews some of the latest technologies equipped with remote sensing, AI, and image processing for managing the palm oil plantation. This manuscript also highlights how the distress in the current palm oil industry could be handled by mentioning some of the improvised monitoring systems for palm oil plantation that could in turn increase the yield of palm oil. It is evident from the proposed review that the accuracy of AI algorithms for palm oil detection depends on various factors such as the quality of the training data, the design of the neural network, and the type of detection task. In general, AI models have achieved high accuracy in detecting palm oil tree images, with some studies reporting accuracy levels up to 91\%. However, it is important to note that accuracy can still be affected by factors such as variations in lighting conditions and image resolution. Nonetheless, with any AI model, the accuracy of algorithms for palm oil tree detection can be improved by collecting more diverse training data and fine-tuning the model.",NA,NA,10.3390/agriculture13020504,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"

Packet Scheduling For Internet Of Remote Things (Iort) Devices In Next Generation Satellite Networks,"Background: The massive amount of deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices via wireless communications has presented a new paradigm in next-generation mobile networks. The rapid growth in the deployment of IoT devices can be linked to the diverse use of several IoT applications for home automation, smart systems, and other forms of innovations in businesses and industry 4.0. Methods: There is a need for a robust network infrastructure to actualize the huge traffic demand of IoT communications in this new paradigm across the globe, including rural and remote areas. However, due to technical and economic constraints, the terrestrial network infrastructure is not able to fulfill this requirement. Hence, the need for satellite network infrastructure. This solution will be of immense benefit to the provision of remote health care, disaster management, remote sensing, and asset tracking, and environmental monitoring, to name a few. While this remains an interesting solution, packet scheduling, which is one of the key radio resource management functions, is still a challenging issue that remains undefined, especially in a satellite network scenario that has its peculiarities and challenges. Results: Hence, the goal of this research work is to design a new packet scheduling scheme suitable for machine-type communications and also mixed-use case scenarios in satellite network scenarios. The performance evaluation of the proposed packet scheduler is conducted through simulations. Conclusion: The newly proposed packet scheduling scheme provides an improvement of approximately 7 Mbps and 0.5 bps/Hz in terms of throughput and spectral efficiency performances, respectively, in mixed-use case scenarios, when compared to known throughput optimal packet schedulers, without serious compromise to other performance metrics. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,NA,10.2174/2210327911666211013140728,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Review: Grass-Based Dairy Systems, Data And Precision Technologies","Precision technologies and data have had relatively modest impacts in grass-based livestock ruminant production systems compared with other agricultural sectors such as arable. Precision technologies promise increased efficiency, reduced environmental impact, improved animal health, welfare and product quality. The benefits of precision technologies have, however, been relatively slow to be realised on pasture based farms. Though there is significant overlap with indoor systems, implementing technology in grass-based dairying brings unique opportunities and challenges. The large areas animals roam and graze in pasture based systems and the associated connectivity challenges may, in part at least, explain the comparatively lower adoption of such technologies in pasture based systems. With the exception of sensor and Bluetooth-enabled plate metres, there are thus few technologies designed specifically to increase pasture utilisation. Terrestrial and satellite-based spectral analysis of pasture biomass and quality is still in the development phase. One of the key drivers of efficiency in pasture based systems has thus only been marginally impacted by precision technologies. In contrast, technological development in the area of fertility and heat detection has been significant and offers significant potential value to dairy farmers, including those in pasture based systems. A past review of sensors in health management for dairy farms concluded that although the collection of accurate data was generally achieved, the processing, integration and presentation of the resulting information and decision-support applications were inadequate. These technologies' value to farming systems is thus unclear. As a result, it is not certain that farm management is being sufficiently improved to justify widespread adoption of precision technologies currently. We argue for a user need-driven development of technologies and for a focus on how outputs arising from precision technologies and associated decision support applications are delivered to users to maximise their value. Further cost/benefit analysis is required to determine the efficacy of investing in specific precision technologies, potentially taking account of several yet to ascertained farm specific variables.",NA,NA,10.1017/s175173111800246x,excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Tools To Aid Post-Wildfire Assessment And Erosion-Mitigation Treatment Decisions,"A considerable investment in post-fire research over the past decade has improved our understanding of wildfire effects on soil, hydrology, erosion and erosion-mitigation treatment effectiveness. Using this new knowledge, we have developed several tools to assist land managers with post-wildfire assessment and treatment decisions, such as prediction models, research syntheses, equipment and methods for field measurements, reference catalogues and databases of past-practice, and spreadsheets for calculating resource valuation and cost-benefit analysis. These tools provide relevant science to post-fire assessment teams and land managers in formats that often can be directly entered into assessment and treatment decision-making protocols. Providing public access to these tools through the internet not only has increased their dissemination, but also has allowed them to be updated and improved as new knowledge and technology become available.

Eas-Cnn: Automatic Design Of Convolutional Neural Network For Remote Sensing Images Semantic Segmentation,"Accurate and effective semantic segmentation methods for remote sensing are important for applications such as precision agriculture, urban planning, and disaster monitoring. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable performance in the field of remote sensing semantic segmentation. However, the design of CNNs is both time-consuming and necessitates a substantial amount of domain expertise and experience. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a neural architecture search method called EAS-CNN. The method constructs a search space based on a U-shaped structure and utilizes a fixed-length encoding solution based on gene expression suppression to preserve potential useful information during the evolution process. Furthermore, an improved genetic strategy is proposed to enhance search efficiency and save computational resources. In this paper, we evaluate the proposed EAS-CNN method against state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods and verify its effectiveness. Experimental results show that EAS-CNN achieves high OA values of 91.2\% and 91.6\% on the Vaihingen and Postman datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough analysis of the experimental results and summarize effective design patterns for model architecture to enhance remote sensing semantic segmentation tasks.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2023.2225710,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Risk Evaluation And Mitigation Strategies: Impact On Patients, Health Care Providers, And Health Systems","Purpose. To describe the impetus for and evolution, components, and potential impact on patients, health care providers, and health systems of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for managing known or potential serious drug risks. Summary. A 2006 report from the Institute of Medicine criticizing FDA for drug withdrawals due to safety problems provided the impetus for FDA to enhance postmarketing surveillance and to require REMS for medications with actual or potential safety concerns; Components of REMS may include medication guides, patient package inserts, communication plans for health care providers, and elements to ensure safe use (e.g., special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, use of patient registries). Recent increases in the number of drugs with REMS requirements, MedWatch alerts, and the development of the new Sentinel Initiative reflect FDA's commitment to drug safety. Patients may be overwhelmed by information about drugs with REMS requirements, which could deter the use of potentially beneficial therapies. Pharmacists can help patients weigh the risks and benefits of drug therapy. Pharmacists, other health care providers, and health systems may find REMS requirements challenging, but FDA is cognizant of the need to balance the goals of ensuring drug safety and providing patient access to drugs without placing an undue burden on the health system. Conclusion. The goal of improving drug safety is sought by the FDA, patients, health care providers, and health systems alike. Collaboration among health care providers may provide efficiencies in meeting FDA REMS requirements.",NA,NA,10.2146/ajhp090461,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Practical Guidance For Deciding Whether To Account For Soil Variability When Managing For Land Health, Agricultural Production And Climate Resilience","Key characteristics of the approach described here are that it is systematic, stepwise, and iterative. Most importantly, it emphasizes the consideration of multiple sources of knowledge and information, including traditional and digital soil maps, models, understanding of soil-landscape relationships based on the soil forming factors, local knowledge, and personal observations. While the approach draws primarily from agronomic examples and focuses on farmer decision-making, it is intentionally generic and can be applied to land use planning. It can also be applied by civil engineers, or even a homeowner who is estimating the size of the leach field for a new or expanded septic system, which depends primarily on soil texture. As described in Decide–6b,the approach can also be easily applied to C sequestration initiatives designed to support climate change mitigation. Fortunately, most of the key properties that control variability in C sequestration potential, such as soil texture, are also critical for crop production so the incremental costs of applying the framework to address multiple land use and management objectives are relatively low. Scientists can apply the framework to focus research on those areas where there is greatest uncertainty in those properties where more information on those properties is likely to improve management outcomes, and where increasing our ability to quantify and map soil variability is most likely to be applied. For example, many of the Earth’s most productive soils were formed on alluvial parent materials. In these landscapes, soil texture in the rooting zone can change over distances of less than a meter. A uniformly low slope gradient combined with a surface layer of uniform texture makes it extremely difficult to map these soils without digging a cost-prohibitive number of pits. New sensors, or systems that combine sensors, remote sensing, and modeling, are needed that can rapidly, reliably, and cheaply detect differences in subsurface texture across these large and important areas. The response answer to the question, “Does soil variability matter?” will always be “It depends.” We suggest that, in addition to increasing the information available to support soil-specific management, it would be helpful to convert the framework described here into a more quantitative and automated desktop decision support system in which the “Preparation” costs are minimized by prepopulating a geo-spatial platform with relevant available data and integrating some simple analysis tools. At the same time the decision support system should assist and encourage the user to carefully review the data and model results; as Brammer (2016) admonished in his description of his own extensive work in soil survey and land evaluation, “The data were analysed personally, not by computer, which meant that all the data were examined personally and suspicious data rejected.” As the dry-land ecologist Walter Whitford frequently stated, “There are statistical outliers, and there out and out liars.” For the question of whether or not “there is likely to be a positive return on investments collecting additional soil information,” the answer is “there is no substitute for actually examining the soil and landscape” (Rossiter et al. 2022), but value relative to the cost depends on all of the factors discussed in this manuscript. Finally, while the complexity of the framework is likely to overwhelm most managers in the form we have presented it here, the benefits of even a cursory application of it may have significant benefits, following the logic presented in Consider a Spherical Cow (Harte 1988). © 2023 Soil Conservation Society of America.

An E Ff Ectiveness Evaluation Model For Satellite Observation And Data- Downlink Scheduling Considering Weather Uncertainties,"Low Earth orbit ( LEO) satellites play an important role in human space activities, and market demands for commercial uses of LEO satellites have been increasing rapidly in recent years. LEO satellites mainly consist of Earth observation satellites ( EOSs), the major commercial applications of which are various sorts of Earth observations, such as map making, crop growth assessment, and disaster surveillance. However, the success rates of observation tasks are influenced considerably by uncertainties in local weather conditions, inadequate sunlight, observation dip angle, and other practical factors. The available time windows ( ATWs) suitable for observing given types of targets and for transmitting data back to ground receiver stations are relatively narrow. In order to utilize limited satellite resources e ffi ciently and maximize their commercial benefits, it is necessary to evaluate the overall e ff ectiveness of satellites and planned tasks considering various factors. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the ATWs considering the influence of sunlight angle, elevation angle, and the type of sensor equipped on the satellite. After that, we develop a satellite e ff ectiveness evaluation ( SEE) model for satellite observation and data- downlink scheduling ( SODS) based on the Availability- Capacity- Profitability ( ACP) framework, which is designed to evaluate the overall performance of satellites from the perspective of time resource utilization, the success rate of tasks, and profit return. The e ff ects of weather uncertainties on the tasks' success are considered in the SEE model, and the model can be applied to support the decision- makers on optimizing and improving task arrangements for EOSs. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the e ff ectiveness of the proposed method and verify the ACP- based SEE model. The obtained ATWs by the proposed method are compared with those by the Systems Tool Kit ( STK), and the correctness of the method is thus validated.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11131621,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
A Genetic Algorithm Approach For Solving The Daily Photograph Selection Problem Of The Spot5 Satellite,"This article addresses the combinatorial optimization problem of managing earth observation satellites (EOSs) such as the French SPOTS, which is concerned with selecting on each day a subset of a set of candidate photographs. The problem has a significant economic importance due to its high initial investment cost that exists in these instruments and its solution difficulty resulting from the large solution space, making it an attractive research area. This article proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the SPOTS selection problem using a new genome representation for maximizing not only a single objective as profit but a multi-criteria objective that includes the number of acquired photographs. Test results of our proposed GA show that it finds optimal solutions effectively for moderate size problems and obtains better results for two large benchmark instances coded 1403 and 1504 in the literature. Also, we verify the result that the best known value in the literature for problem coded 1401 is an optimal value. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Perceptions Of Primary Care Staff On A Regional Data Quality Intervention In Australian General Practice: A Qualitative Study,"Background: Technological advances in clinical data capturing and storage systems have led to recent attempts at disease surveillance and region specific population health planning through regularly collected primary care administrative clinical data. However the accuracy and comprehensiveness of primary care health records remain questionable. Methods: We aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of general practice staff in maintaining accurate patient health data within clinical software used in primary care settings of regional NSW. Focus groups were conducted with general practitioners, practice nurses and practice administrative staff from 17 practices in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven region of the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia that had participated in the Sentinel Practices Data Sourcing (SPDS) project - a general practice based chronic disease surveillance and data quality improvement study. A total of 25 respondents that included 12 general practitioners (GPs) and 13 practice staff participated in the 6 focus groups. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. Results: Five key themes emerged from the data. Firstly, the theme of resourcing data management raised issues of time constraints, the lack of a dedicated data management role and the importance of multidisciplinary involvement, including a data champion. The need for incentives was identified as being important to motivate ongoing commitment to maintaining data quality. However, quality of software packages, including coding issues and software limitations and information technology skills were seen as key barriers. The final theme provided insight into the lessons learnt from the project and the increased awareness of the importance of data quality amongst practice staff. Conclusion: The move towards electronic methods of maintaining general practice patient records offers significant potential benefits in terms of both patient care and monitoring of health status and health needs within the community. However, this study has reinforced the importance of human factors in the maintenance of such datasets. To achieve optimal benefits of electronic health and medical records for patient care and for population health planning purposes, it is extremely essential to address the barriers that clinicians and other staff face in maintaining complete and correct primary care patient electronic health and medical information.",NA,NA,10.1186/s12875-016-0445-8,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

In the SOA, after given center point, search direction, search radius, and trust degree, every seeker moves to a new position (a candidate solution) from his current position based on his historical and social experiences. In this process, the update formula is like Y-conditional cloud generator. The algorithm's performance was studied using several typically complex functions. In all cases studied, SOA is superior to continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) greatly in terms of optimization quality, robustness and efficiency. At the same time, SOA greatly outperforms particle swarm optimization (PSO) in convergence speed. However, SOA needs more computation time. Simulations of designing both PID controller and IIR digital filter also show that SOA gets more satisfactory solutions with better evaluation values.",NA,NA,10.1080/18756891.2013.864476,excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Predicting The Provisioning Potential Of Forest Ecosystem Services Using Airborne Laser Scanning Data And Forest Resource Maps,"Background: Remote sensing-based mapping of forest Ecosystem Service (ES) indicators has become increasingly popular. The resulting maps may enable to spatially assess the provisioning potential of ESs and prioritize the land use in subsequent decision analyses. However, the mapping is often based on readily available data, such as land cover maps and other publicly available databases, and ignoring the related uncertainties. Methods: This study tested the potential to improve the robustness of the decisions by means of local model fitting and uncertainty analysis. The quality of forest land use prioritization was evaluated under two different decision support models: either using the developed models deterministically or in corporation with the uncertainties of the models. Results: Prediction models based on Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data explained the variation in proxies of the suitability of forest plots for maintaining biodiversity, producing timber, storing carbon, or providing recreational uses (berry picking and visual amenity) with RMSEs of 15\%-30\%, depending on the ES. The RMSEs of the ALS-based predictions were 47\%-97\% of those derived from forest resource maps with a similar resolution. Due to applying a similar field calibration step on both of the data sources, the difference can be attributed to the better ability of ALS to explain the variation in the ES proxies. Conclusions: Despite the different accuracies, proxy values predicted by both the data sources could be used for a pixel-based prioritization of land use at a resolution of 250 m(2), i.e., in a considerably more detailed scale than required by current operational forest management. The uncertainty analysis indicated that maps of the ES provisioning potential should be prepared separately based on expected and extreme outcomes of the ES proxy models to fully describe the production possibilities of the landscape under the uncertainties in the models.",NA,NA,10.1186/s40663-018-0143-1,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
On The Ability Of Sliding Mode And Lqr Controllers Optimized With Pso In Attitude Control Of A Flexible 4-Dof Satellite With Time-Varying Payload,"Precise pointing of the satellite and its payload is essential in the accurate accomplishment of a space mission. In this study, the system of a satellite and its payload are considered as 4-DOF equations of motion. The time-varying payload can observe one direction of the Earth independently, and the satellite can point to the Earth station by its 3-DOF motions simultaneously. Sliding mode and LQR controllers are designed for damping disturbances, and consequently high pointing accuracy. Environmental disturbances and the associated time delay of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are applied to the system. An algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to find the optimum values of variables and Normalized Integral Square Error (NISE) of the two aforementioned controllers. Numerical simulations indicate the optimized magnitudes of target detection errors and control efforts in four directions. The results revealed that PSO-SMC can finely track the time-varying payload and has better efficiency in comparison with PSO-LQR. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Potential For Income Improvement And Biodiversity Conservation Via Specialty Coffee In Ethiopia,"The specialty coffee sector represents opportunities for coffee farmers and other actors due to increased value within the supply chain, driven by elevated consumer purchase prices. We investigated these relationships up to the export stage, as well as the potential for specialty coffee to improve stakeholder participation in biodiversity conservation. Household data was collected from a sample of 272 coffee farmers belonging to five primary cooperatives, in the heavily forested area of Yayu, in the Illubabor administrative zone of Oromia regional state in south-western Ethiopia, for the 2017/2018 harvest season. Qualitative and quantitative data, gathered between 2015 and 2019, from focus group discussions, was used to supplement the survey and to explain the empirical findings. We show that the income from coffee (and thus household income) can be increased, in some cases substantially, via participation in the specialty coffee market. The unit price for coffee was much higher than standard market prices and those including certification premiums. Whilst quality is a key factor for specialty coffee, income increases via the specialty market are caveat bound. In particular, there is a critical requirement for efficient and effective cooperative management, and we provide suggestions for improvements. In the long-term, more focus is needed to increase the financial and human capacities of Ethiopian coffee cooperatives, to make them more effective partners in the specialty coffee value chain. The high conversion rates from harvested to clean exportable specialty coffee (8:1, or higher) is identified as a major constraint on profitability. We show that specialty coffee can bring about positive environmental benefits. Elevating coffee prices and farm profitability to bring household income levels to around or above the global poverty line may ensure the continuation of forest coffee production, and thus the retention of forest. The increases in income via specialty coffee production, reported in the study, were achieved without increasing land use or the application of environmentally costly inputs. Moreover, analysis of satellite data shows that a large proportion of the coffee farms surveyed retain a level of forest cover and quality approaching primary (undisturbed) forest, and that the coffee production area at Yayu has not experienced any significant deforestation (since 2000). We recommend that coffee premiums linked to environmental benefit should demonstrate clearly defined and appropriate metrics, as we have demonstrated here for forest (canopy) quality and coverage (area).",NA,NA,10.7717/peerj.10621,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Estimation The Water Ratio Index (Wri) And Automated Water Extraction Index (Awei) Of Bath In The United Kingdom Using Remote Sensing Technology Of The Multispectral Data Of Landsat 8-Oli,"Remote sensing is commonly utilized for surface cover classification and change analysis. An important approach in studying water resources and assessing hydrological drought involves utilizing remote sensing to extract various land cover features. Given the potential influence of environmental noise, the objective of this study is to devise an index that enhances water extraction accuracy while establishing a stable threshold value. The investigation focuses on the Water Ratio Index (WRI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) in the context of Bath, United Kingdom, particularly addressing areas with shadows and dark surfaces that often lead to misclassifications by other indices. The application and comparative performance assessment of these indices are conducted using GIS and Remote Sensing technology. WRI analysis reveals index values ranging from 0.83 to 1.24, highlighting regions with water or moisture content (WRI greater than 1) and extensive areas devoid of water (WRI less than 1). Notably, AWEI nsh yields more accurate predictions than AWEI sh, which tends to identify shade and man-made surfaces rather than water surfaces. AWEI nsh exhibits a significantly higher water land cover figure (11342.5) compared to AWEI sh's minimal value (359.5). In scenarios where water information is susceptible to noise, AWEI proves to be a more suitable and effective alternative water index. It is recommended for use in locations with challenging water data, offering improved accuracy and reliability. © 2024, Zibeline International Publishing Sdn. Bhd..

"Predator Defense Is Shaped By Risk, Brood Value And Social Group Benefits In A Cooperative Breeder","Predation is a major cause of mortality and nest failure in birds. Cooperative predator defense can enhance nest success and adult survival but, because it is inherently risky, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that individuals modify defense behavior according to the risk posed by the predator. Parental investment theory, on the other hand, predicts that reproductive payoffs (brood value) determine investment in nest defense. We propose that, in cooperative breeders, fitness benefits deriving from the survival of other group members may additionally influence defense behavior (social group benefits theory). We tested predictions of these theories in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, where brood value is higher for breeders, but social group benefits more important for helpers. We recorded experimentally induced individual defense behaviors in response to predator models presented near nests, representing differing levels of threat to nests and adults. As predicted, 1) individuals engaged in less risky defenses when encountering a more dangerous predator (dynamic risk assessment theory); 2) individuals defended older broods more often, and breeders defended more than helpers (parental investment theory); and 3) helpers were more likely to respond to a predator of adults (social group benefits theory). Our findings highlight that predator defense in cooperative breeders is complex, shaped by the combination of immediate risk and multiple benefits.",NA,NA,10.1093/beheco/araa012,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Adaptive Routing Strategy Based On Improved Double Q-Learning For Satellite Internet Of Things,"Satellite Internet of Things (S-IoT), which integrates satellite networks with IoT, is a new mobile Internet to provide services for social networks. However, affected by the dynamic changes of topology structure and node status, the efficient and secure forwarding of data packets in S-IoT is challenging. In view of the abovementioned problem, this paper proposes an adaptive routing strategy based on improved double Q-learning for S-IoT. First, the whole S-IoT is regarded as a reinforcement learning environment, and satellite nodes and ground nodes in S-IoT are both regarded as intelligent agents. Each node in the S-IoT maintains two Q tables, which are used for selecting the forwarding node and for evaluating the forwarding value, respectively. In addition, the next hop node of data packets is determined depending on the mixed Q value. Second, in order to optimize the Q value, this paper makes improvements on the mixed Q value, the reward value, and the discount factor, respectively, based on the congestion degree, the hop count, and the node status. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of this adaptive routing strategy in terms of delivery rate, average delay, and overhead ratio. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can achieve more efficient and secure routing in the highly dynamic environment compared with the state-of-the-art strategies.",NA,NA,10.1155/2021/5530023,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Modified Random Forest With Empirical Loss Function Through Crowd-Sourced Data,"Environmental changes are captured as satellite images and stored in datasets for monitoring a particular location. These remote sensing images can be employed in predicting valuable data for both urban planning and in land-use management. Moreover, infrastructure planning, management of natural resources are also assessed using these images. Many traditional classification approaches have been utilized in classifying images. However, it resulted with processing of limited images and acquired minimum accuracy rate. In order to overcome the challenges in existing systems, the present research takes effort in utilizing three datasets such as SAT-4, SAT-6 and RSI-CB for proposed classification. Using such crowd sourced data, images are annotated clearly through vector information. Such images are taken for three stage implementation in proposed work for effective classification of satellite images. Large scale distribution data contains six categories and 35 sub-classes with 40,000 images of size 128 x 128 pixels. Initially, pre-processing performs checking of missing values and feature scaling to avoid incorrect predictions. The second stage is the feature extraction process performed by VGG19 and ResNet 50 architecture which provides best features. Individually extracted features from both models are concatenated and sent as input to the third stage of classification. Modified RF (Random Forest) with empirical loss function is used for classification which classifies images with majority voting process on tree based structure. Loss values are computed to determine the efficacy of the model. In addition to that, classification process is also executed by DT (Decision Tree) and K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbour) to exhibit the classification efficiency of proposed model. Performance evaluation on three datasets along with comparative analysis with other classification methods in terms of precision, accuracy, f1-score and recall are performed for determining the effectiveness of present research.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11042-023-17556-3,excluded,{Validation/calibration}
The Important Of Global Precipitation Measurement In Ungauged Catchment,"In line with the technological development in the remote sensing field like satellite data, the measurement of rainfall can be carried out by rainfall monitoring in large areas even in places that cannot be reached by conventional tools. This superiority can be utilized to get the rainfall in a region for the importance of water resources management due to the validity and accuracy that can be reliable and represent the rainfall characteristic. Research about the utilization of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data is conducted in the Wonogiri ungauged catchment. However, to utilize the satellite rainfall data is necessary to be carried out a correction, so the rainfall characteristic that is produced by the satellite is close to the condition of observed rainfall data. The correcting is carried out by multiplying every data interval with a certain coefficient, so the produced value by the satellite data approaches the value characteristic that is produced by observed rainfall. Based on the result of trial and error, there is produced as follows: for the interval between 0 and 2 mm, the correction coefficient is 0; for the interval between 2 and 20 mm, the correction coefficient is 0.075; for the interval between 20 until 30 mm, the correction coefficient is 0.8; for the interval between 30 until 50 mm, the correction coefficient is 0.85; and for the interval more than 50 mm, the correction coefficient is 0.95. © 2006-2023 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

"Multiscale Advanced Raster Map Analysis System: Definition, Design And Development","This paper brings together a multidisciplinary initiative to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for analyzing, assessing, and extracting information from raster maps. This information will provide a rigorous foundation to address a wide range of applications including disease mapping, emerging infectious diseases, landscape ecological assessment, land cover trends and change detection, watershed assessment, and map accuracy assessment. It will develop an advanced map analysis system that integrates these techniques with an advanced visualization toolbox, and use the system to conduct large case studies using rich sets of raster data, primarily from remotely sensed imagery. As a result, it will be possible to study and evaluate raster maps of societal, ecological, and environmental variables to facilitate quantitative characterization and comparative analysis of geospatial trends, patterns, and phenomena. In addition to environmental and ecological studies, these techniques and tools can be used for policy decisions at national, state, and local levels, crisis management, and protection of infrastructure. Geospatial data form the foundation of an information-based society. Remote sensing has been a vastly under-utilized resource involving a multi-million dollar investment at the national levels. Even when utilized, the credibility has been at stake, largely because of lack of tools that can assess, visualize, and communicate accuracy and reliability in timely manner and at desired confidence levels. Consider an imminent 21st century scenario: What message does a multi-categorical map have about the large landscape it represents? And at what scale, and at what level of detail? Does the spatial pattern of the map reveal any societal, ecological, environmental condition of the landscape? And therefore can it be an indicator of change? How do you automate the assessment of the spatial structure and behavior of change to discover critical areas, hot spots, and their corridors? Is the map accurate? How accurate is it? How do you assess the accuracy of the map? How do we evaluate a temporal change map for change detection? What are the implications of the kind and amount of change and accuracy on what matters, whether climate change, carbon emission, water resources, urban sprawl, biodiversity, indicator species, human health, or early warning? And with what confidence? The proposed research initiative is expected to find answers to these questions and a few more that involve multi-categorical raster maps based on remote sensing and other geospatial data. It includes the development of techniques for map modeling and analysis using Markov Random Fields, geospatial statistics, accuracy assessment and change detection, upper echelons of surfaces, advanced computational techniques for geospatial data mining, and advanced visualization techniques.",NA,NA,10.1023/b:eest.0000027205.77490.8c,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A Novel Approach To Capacity Building For Security Applications,"In the context of the European Commission's Network of Excellence GMOSS (Global Monitoring for Security and Stability) a training approach has been developed and tested with the aim to integrate technology, natural sciences and social sciences in order to enhance the monitoring capability in the cross-cutting emerging field of security research. The training measure contributes to the establishment of a platform for experienced researchers who will make their impact felt by feeding research results into the security community and are themselves prepared to act on an implementation level. The alumni are social and political scientists with a sound understanding of monitoring capabilities as well as natural scientists and remote sensing experts with a sensitivity to political concepts, structures and processes in different security relevant fields. These objectives are accomplished by the following results: (a) A research agenda is developed which encompasses studies on social and political science research, facilitates the exchange of information between stakeholders, and activates existing organizational structures or stimulates the establishment of new ones. (b) Presentations and practical sessions are organized to inform on the state-of-the-art techniques in: Effective monitoring of international treaties for environmental protection and the development of tools for early warning Better estimates of populations on a global scale and the rapid remote damage assessment Generic methods, algorithms and software needed for the automated interpretation and visualisation of imagery, including feature recognition and change detection (c) The specific training measures stimulate the integration of research, incorporate the know-how of external experts and provide required soft-skills for future career options in science, technology and policy implementation for security. The key questions to be dealt with are: how can we cope with a certain hazard/threat and what can we do to reduce the susceptibility to a probable risk? The response to both aspects requires fast decision making (disaster management) or taking preventive measures (risk reduction) long before an event. To test capabilities of first responders, the commonly practiced methodology in disaster management is contingency exercises. In the context of our training approach we explore the wide experience provided by military research organizations with scenario analysis, situation awareness and gaming. The participants of the training course have to act in given scenarios reflecting possible risks, make decisions on interventions and gather experience about the specification and relevance of information needed. The outcome of the games are analyzed in considerable detail and discussed with experts working for relevant organizations. First results from Summer Schools in 2005 and 2006 indicate that participants highly value the approach and organizations dealing with disaster risk reduction or security are greatly interested to be involved in the exercise.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-1-4020-8484-3_5,excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Harmonization Of The Land Cover Classification System (Lccs) With The General Habitat Categories (Ghc) Classification System,"Monitoring land cover and habitat change is a key issue for conservation managers because of its potential negative impact on biodiversity. The Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and the General Habitat Categories (GHC) System have been proposed by the remote sensing and ecological research community, respectively, for the classification of land covers and habitats across various scales. Linking the two systems can be a major step forward towards biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing. The translation between the two systems has proved to be challenging, largely because of differences in definitions and related difficulties in creating one-to-one relationships between the two systems. This paper proposes a system of rules for linking the two systems and additionally identifies requirements for site-specific contextual and environmental information to enable the translation. As an illustration, the LCCS classification of the Le Cesine protected area in Italy is used to show rules for translating the LCCS classes to GHCs. This study demonstrates the benefits of a translation system for biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing data but also shows that a successful translation is often depending on the degree of ecological knowledge of the habitats and its relationship with land cover and contextual information. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Resource Management In High Throughput Satellite With Multi Port Amplifier (Mpa),"The demand for data capacity has been growing, especially in the aviation and maritime industries and is expected to continue to grow in the foreseeable future. The satellite industry is moving to High Throughput Satellite (HTS) that are characterized by large numbers of small spot beams, frequency reuse, higher Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) and higher Gain to Noise Temperature (G/T) to meet growing capacity demand. Multi-Port Amplifiers (MPA) increase the flexibility of HTS systems by allowing capacity to be allocated dynamically based on changing demand. This will allow capacity requirements to be planned based on the sum of the requirements across all beams rather than the peaks in each HTS beam. The authors propose a ground based solution that will maximize resource utilization of an HTS with an MPA and deliver the capacity dynamically based on demand. Maritime, commercial aviation, satellite based cellular backhaul, and disaster recovery services are the main applications that can benefit from the solution they propose. The authors' results show significant reduction in the overall capacity requirements because of the more efficient utilization of the satellite resources. © 2021, IGI Global.",NA,NA,10.4018/978-1-7998-5357-2.ch045,excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Color-Line And Dark Channel Based Dehazing For Remote Sensing Images,"A color-line and dark channel based dehazing algorithm was proposed to solve the problem of image contrast decreasing caused by haze in remote sensing images. In view of the deficiencies in the color-line a priori, a least squares based transmittance optimization method was proposed. In order to obtain a more accurate transmittance distribution, the transmissivity maps estimated by the color-line prior and the dark channel prior are fused by weight which is calculated by their credibility. A gradient regularization constraint was added to the optimization equation to avoid the halo effect. The experimental results show that the proposed method is accurate in estimating transmittance and the clarity of the reconstruction results is significantly improved. In addition, the objoctive evaluation index is improved as its Gray Mean Grads(GMG) and Information Entropy(IE) show the highest average value, which indicates that the proposed method has achieve the best reconstruction result among the state-of -art methods. © 2019, Science Press.

Combining National Forest Inventory Field Plots And Remote Sensing Data For Forest Databases,"Information about forest cover is needed by all of the nine societal benefit areas identified by the Group of Earth Observation (GEO). In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Synergies In Standardized Management Systems: Some Empirical Evidence,"Purpose Management system standards (MSSs) have spread in an unprecedented manner in the last few years. Thus, there are now many companies that rely on more than one such standard to establish the criteria for organizational management systems (MSs). The objective of this article is to analyze the existence of possible synergies in the application of a wide range of MSSs through an examination of the benefits obtained from the implementation of one particular MSS, namely ISO 9001. Design/methodology/approach The starting point is a set of results from an empirical survey of more than 500 Spanish companies. Specifically, the differences between the benefits recognized by companies implementing a single MSS, namely ISO 9001:2000 for quality MSs, and those that implemented a second standard, in this case ISO 14001:2004 for environmental MSs, are discussed. An additional comparison is made between those organizations that have integrated the two MSSs into a single MS and those organizations that have developed separate quality and environmental MSs. Findings The results show that organizations with multiple MSSs actually perceive more benefits from the implementation of ISO 9001 than those that implemented that standard only. Furthermore, organizations with integrated management systems (IMSs) also report higher levels of ISO 9001 benefits compared to those organizations with the ISO 9001 certificate only, but generally not when compared to their counterparts with separate standardized MSs. Originality/value Relatively little is known about the synergies yielded by the use of multiple MSSs or by integrating standardized MSs in organizations. Using the benefits obtained from the implementation of ISO 9001 as a measure, this paper contributes empirical results from a large number of organizations to the study of both of these issues. Therefore, it is of value to researchers and practitioners in quality, environmental, safety, security and other such MSs, but also specifically in the area of IMSs. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is very well known that remote sensing of flooding, especially in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, can complement ground-based observations and be integrated with flood models to augment the amount of information available to end-users, decision-makers and scientists. This paper aims to provide a concise review of both the science and applications of microwave remote sensing of flood inundation, focusing mainly on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), in a variety of natural and man-made environments. Strengths and limitations are discussed and the paper will conclude with a brief account on perspectives and emerging technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
