"On-Going European Space Agency Activities on Measuring the Benefits of Earth Observations to Society: Challenges, Achievements and Next Steps","Tassa, Alessandra","Understanding the Earth system and its physical and societal processes is crucial for helping humankind develop in a sustainable way, and for designing effective policies across a wide range of applications that include mitigating the effects of climate change, the sustainable management of natural resources, food security and public health. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide regular and accurate observations of the entire planet that can greatly support improvements in such understanding. The European Space Agency (ESA) is committed to supporting international efforts to decipher the processes and phenomena that regulate life on Earth, by building world class EO space missions and making data available to scientists and citizens across the world. How successful is ESA in this endeavour? Given the variable and dynamic nature of EO data use, it is difficult to answer the question through established figures. Yet, it is crucial that ESA be able to discriminate and assess the benefits brought by the use of its EO missions, in order to demonstrate its achievements, to keep improving its systems, to better design and plan future missions, and to promote further uptake. In this article, after recalling its commitments in support of Earth system sciences, ESA’s attempts to conduct valuations of the impact of its own space missions are described. In particular, the challenges encountered in measuring such impacts and the solutions pursued by the Agency to improve its assessment capabilities are detailed, together with the open issues and the current lines of work.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.788843,included,2022,satellite Earth Observations|socio-economic impacts|impacts assessment|indicators|Value of Informati
Landsat Data Ecosystem Case Study: Actor Perceptions of the Use and Value of Landsat,"Molder, Edmund","It is well-known that Earth observation (EO) data plays a critical role in scientific understanding about the global environment. There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts. Both the role of Big Data and associated technologies are discussed as they relate to the ultimate use of Landsat-derived information products to guide decision-making, and key data ecosystem characteristics that shape the likelihood of these products’ use are highlighted.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.805174,included,2022,Landsat|data ecosystem|values|decision support|societal benefits|qualitative|remote sensing|Earth ob
Using Data from Earth Observation to Support Sustainable Development Indicators: An Analysis of the Literature and Challenges for the Future,"Andries, Ana","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework aims to end poverty, improve health and education, reduce inequality, design sustainable cities, support economic growth, tackle climate change and leave no one behind. To monitor and report the progress on the 231 unique SDGs indicators in all signatory countries, data play a key role. Here, we reviewed the data challenges and costs associated with obtaining traditional data and satellite data (particularly for developing countries), emphasizing the benefits of using satellite data, alongside their portal and platforms in data access. We then assessed, under the maturity matrix framework (MMF 2.0), the current potential of satellite data applications on the SDG indicators that were classified into the sustainability pillars. Despite the SDG framework having more focus on socio-economic aspects of sustainability, there has been a rapidly growing literature in the last few years giving practical examples in using earth observation (EO) to monitor both environmental and socio-economic SDG indicators; there is a potential to populate 108 indicators by using EO data. EO also has a wider potential to support the SDGs beyond the existing indicators.",Sustainability,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031191,included,2022,earth observation|SDGs|indicator type|data challenges
As Seen From Space: Tele-Epidemiological Data as Pandemic Memory,"Gleason, Louis","In the modern world, data is instrumental in historical storytelling. The magnitude of events, who they impacted, and the degree to which the events were managed are all, very often, told through the lens of data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such data-driven history, where statistics on infections, death, vaccination, and average mobility are used to tell the story of how the pandemic unfolded in a given locale. While such statistical history is useful, it can also efface the histories of locations that lack access to the proper surveillance infrastructure, or are otherwise unable to deploy it. This produces an erasure of pandemic memory in healthcare-challenged areas, as deaths and infections go unrecorded and undocumented. This paper proposes the use of satellites to correct this, using Earth observation technologies to track viral vectors and find and document mass burial sites to produce a fuller picture of pandemic history, with an emphasis on filling the statistical gaps between the developed and developing world.",Oracle: The History Journal of Boston College,2022,https://ejournals.bc.edu/index.php/orac/article/view/15255,included,2022,Pandemics|Tele-Epidemiology|The Spanish Flu|ele-Epidemiology|Healthcare Studies
Geographic microtargeting of social assistance with high-resolution poverty maps,"Smythe, Isabella","Hundreds of millions of poor families receive some form of targeted social assistance. Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning–based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning–based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2022,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120025119,included,2022,poverty|targeting|satellite imagery|Nigeria
Earth observations can enable cost-effective conservation of eastern north pacific blue whales: a value of information analysis,"Bernknopf, Richard","We conduct an analysis to estimate the value of information (VOI) of Earth observations for prospective regulation of marine shipping to conserve Eastern North Pacific blue whales in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States. Outcomes are driven by differences across two data products that can be used to inform regulations to limit ship strikes. In the reference case, vessel speed limits depend on species distribution data from shipboard surveys. In the counterfactual case, speed limits depend on species distributions predicted by WhaleWatch, a federal data product incorporating information from several remote sensing technologies. The VOI is identified as the difference in costs to marine shipping operators under the reference and counterfactual cases for regulation of vessel speeds. We estimate that the annual VOI of WhaleWatch is US $21–332 million, depending on the conservation goals of the modeled regulation. Conserving more blue whales—averting more ship strikes—increases the VOI.",NA,2021,https://media.rff.org/documents/Earth_Observations_can_enable_cost-effective_conservation_of._bm_RB_LD.pdf,included,2021,NA
Enhancing Access and Usage of Earth Observations in Environmental Decision-Making in Eastern and Southern Africa Through Capacity Building,"Shukla, Shraddhanand","Major strides have been made in the development of remote sensing, reanalysis, and model-based earth observations (EOs), which can be used for long-term climate variability mapping, as well as real-time environmental monitoring and forecasting. Such EOs are particularly valuable for environmental decision-making (e.g., for environmental resources management and disaster mitigation) in the Eastern and Southern Africa (E & SA) region, where ground-based EOs are sparse. Nonetheless, operational application of those EOs to inform decision-making in the region remains limited. This paper reports on a recently concluded (as of June 2019) NASA SERVIR-supported Applied Science Team project that contributed to the uptake of EO applications to inform decision-making in this region. This project was conducted in close collaboration with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)—the NASA SERVIR regional hub in E & SA. The capacity-building efforts leveraged RCMRD’s existing environmental service capacity, their long experience in capacity building in the region, and their extensive network of regional partners, with the goal of increasing RCMRD and their regional partners’ ability to uptake EOs to enhance their environmental services and, hence, improve the environmental decision-making process. The project focused on: (1) Transfer of technology—Transition and implementation of web-based tools to RCMRD to allow easy processing and visualization of EOs and (2) Capacity training—training of representatives from regional and national environmental service agencies in EO application based on targeted case studies. Here, we describe these capacity-building efforts, provide specific examples to demonstrate the benefits of those efforts in terms of enhanced uptake of EOs, and provide recommendations for furthering the uptake of EOs in the region and beyond.",Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.504063,included,2021,earth observation|capacity building|Eastern Africa|Southern Africa|environmental services|decision-m
Economic Potential of Oil Palm Plantation Using Remote Sensing-Based Technology in Indonesia,"Diana, Shinta","The productivity of Indonesia's palm oil was considered low when referring to the 14.6 million ha land area in 2019, with the production of national palm oil only reaching 3.2 tons of CPO/ha/year. The uses of remote sensing technology as a means of monitoring and supervising, were expected to increase oil palm production in line with productivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the economic potential based on oil palm plantation productivity, with and without using remote sensing-based technology, as well as other variables likely to affect productivity. Primary and secondary data collection methods were also used in this research. There were three quantitative methods being used in this study, namely (i) Multiple regression model with panel data, (ii) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tool, and (iii) Multinomial logistic regression technique. The results showed that the generated economic potential from the utilization of the remote sensing model, had efficient opportunity value of 10.48, which was higher than the non-usage of the technology. Therefore, the main variables that affected productivity in this study, were fertilizer and labour.",The Asian Journal of Technology Management,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.12695/ajtm.2021.14.1.2,included,2021,Efficiency|oil-palm|remote sensing (spot 6)|policy|binomial logistic
Monetising the savings of remotely sensed data and information in burn area emergency response (BAER) wildfire assessment,"Bernknopf, R.","We used a value of information approach to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of using satellite imagery as part ofthe Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER), a US federal program that identifies imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property and critical natural or cultural resources. Wecompared the costs associated with producing a Burn Area Reflectance Classification map and implementing a BAER when imagery from satellites (either Landsat or a commercial satellite) was available to when the response team relied on information collected solely by aerial reconnaissance. The case study included two evaluations with and without Burn Area Reflectance Classification products: (a) savings of up to US$51,000 for the Elk Complex wildfire incident request and (b) savings of a multi-incident map production program. Landsat is the most cost-effective way to input burn severity information into the BAER program, with savings of up to US$35 million over a 5-year period.",International Journal of Wildland Fire,2021,https://doi.org/10.1071/WF19209,included,2021,cost effectiveness|fire economics|fire severity|policy|remote sensing
A Scalable Earth Observations-Based Decision Support System for Hydropower Planning in Africa,"Koppa, Akash","Hydropower is a key part of the increasing shift in power production from nonrenewables to renewable energy. In regions such as Africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty elimination. However, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often suboptimal due to the lack of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts. Here, we present a decision support system (DSS) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal time scales by combining data from earth observation satellites (EOS) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical models and hydrologic modeling. The large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based measurements. In addition, an EOS evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow in calibrating hydrologic models. Compared to a DSS forced with a climatological forecast (zero-skill), the hydropower production with the new DSS increased by 20%. The study highlights the advantage of using data from EOS in overcoming the issue of data scarcity in water resources applications, particularly in developing regions of the world such as Africa.",Journal of the American Water Resources Association,2021,https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12914,included,2021,hydropower|decision support system|remote sensing|water resources
Enhancing the Application of Earth Observations for Improved Environmental Decision-Making Using the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX),"Shukla, Shraddhanand","The mitigation of losses due to extreme climate events and long-term climate adaptation requires climate informed decision-making. In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWX’s core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described. Then, a comprehensive overview of the Viewer, which is a web-based interface used to access EOs, is provided. This includes a description of (i) the maps and associated features to access gridded EO data and anomalies for different temporal averaging periods, (ii) time series graphs and associated features to access EOs aggregated over polygons such as administrative boundaries, and (iii) commonly used EOs served by the EWX that provide assessments of climate and vegetation conditions. Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted. Regional implementation of the EWX facilitates access to regionally focused EOs and their availability at polygon boundaries most relevant to the local decision-makers. Similar instances of EWX implemented in other regions, especially those susceptible to food and water security, will likely further enhance the application of EOs for informed decision-making.",Frontiers in Climate,2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2020.583509,included,2021,USAID|USGS|DARPA|ARO|earth observation|food security|water security|web service|drought|climate serv
Valuing User Preferences for Geospatial Fire Monitoring in Guatemala,"Berenter, Jared","Like many landscapes across Central America, forests in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) are increasingly susceptible to forest fire, with most forest fires resulting from untended agricultural fires. Fire damage poses significant risk to the MBR’s natural resources and cultural heritage, but budget challenges limit the capacity of national, regional, and local institutions to effectively detect, monitor, and control forest fires. The Geospatial Information System for Fire Management (SIGMA-I) is a United States government-subsidized suite of geospatial fire management tools that are widely disseminated, free of charge, to land managers and other users in Guatemala for on-the-ground fire prevention and response. Provision of SIGMA-I geospatial data and tools such as daily thermal “hotspot” maps provide positive benefits for sustainable fire management. However, little research exists supporting the nonmarket monetary value of geospatial fire monitoring tools and their component features. We used a choice experiment to estimate land managers’ willingness to pay for individual attributes of SIGMA-I hotspot mapping in Guatemala. We found quantitative evidence of positive willingness to pay for geospatial data, demonstrating positive nonmarket value of geospatial data for sustainable fire management in developing countries and regions where agricultural fires are common. Our results indicate strong preferences from Guatemala’s forest fire management community for improving the frequency of hotspot reporting and reducing detection of erroneous hotspots. As the availability of geospatial data increases, use of tools like SIGMA-I has the potential to significantly improve fire management, especially in regions where funding and resources for fire management are scarce. Our results support continued multinational funding for tools like SIGMA-I for forest fire management in Guatemala and other developing countries.",Sustainability,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/su132112077,included,2021,Guatemala|Maya Biosphere Reserve|geospatial|remote sensing|forest fire|hotspot|value of information|
Quantifying the human health benefits of using satellite information to detect cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and manage recreational advisories in U.S. lakes,"Stroming, Signe","Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000–$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.",GeoHealth,2020,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GH000254,included,2020,NA
"Interactive Model for Assessing Mangrove Health, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, and Satellite Design in Rio de Janeiro Using Earth Observation Data","Reid, Jack","There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally relevant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary, interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence shing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data, cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1985. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes? This case study is demonstrative of the viability of a similar approach for ecosystems around the world.",NA,2020,https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/129598,included,2020,earth observation|model-based systems engineering|mangroves|machine learning|decision support
Market-based methods for monetizing uncertainty reduction,"Cooke, Roger","New measurement systems are often expensive and need a solid economic justification. Traditional tools based on the value of information are sometimes difficult to apply. When risks are traded in a market, it may be possible to use market instruments to monetize the reductions in uncertainty. This paper illustrates such market-based methods with a satellite system designed to reduce uncertainty in predicting soil moisture in the USA. Soil moisture is a key variable in managing agricultural production and predicting crop yields. Using data on corn and soybean futures, we find that a 30% reduction in the weather-related component of uncertainty in corn and soybean futures pricing yields a yearly US consumer surplus of $1.44 billion. The total present value of information from the satellite system for the USA—calculated with a 3% discount rate—is about $22 billion, assuming the system is in operation for 20 years. The global value of the improvements in weather forecasting could be $63 billion.",Environment Systems and Decisions,2020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-019-09748-w,included,2020,Value of Information|options pricing|SMAP|Bachelier formula|Black-Scholes-Merton model
Knowledge generation using satellite earth observations to support sustainable development goals (SDG): A use case on Land degradation,"Giuliani, Gregory","Land degradation is a critical issue globally requiring immediate actions for protecting biodiversity and associated services provided by ecosystems that are supporting human quality of life. The latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Landmark Assessment Report highlighted that human activities are considerably degrading land and threating the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion\npeople. In order to reduce and ideally reverse this prevailing situation, national capacities should be strengthened to enable effective assessments and mapping of their degraded lands as recommended by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The indicator 15.3.1 (“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”) requires regular data production by countries to inform and assess it through space and time. Earth\nObservations (EO) can play an important role both for generating the indicator in countries where it is missing, as well complementing or enhancing national official data sources. In response to this issue, this paper presents an innovative, scalable and flexible approach to monitor land degradation at various scales (e.g., national, regional, global) using various components of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) platform to leverage EO resources for informing SDG 15.3.1. The proposed approach follows the Data-Information-Knowledge pattern using the Trends.Earth model (http://trends.earth) and various data sources to generate the indicator. It also implements additional components for model execution and orchestration, knowledge management, and visualization. The proposed approach has been successfully applied at global, regional and national scales and advances the vision of (1) establishing data analytics platforms that can potentially support countries to discover, access and use the necessary datasets to assess land degradation; and (2) developing new capacities to effectively and efficiently use EO-based resources.",International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102068,included,2020,Land degradation|Sustainable development goal|knowledge|earth observations|Vlab|GEOSS|Trends.Earth
Essential Variables for Environmental Monitoring: What Are the Possible Contributions of Earth Observation Data Cubes?,"Giuliani, Gregory","Environmental sustainability is nowadays a major global issue that requires efficient and effective responses from governments. Essential variables (EV) have emerged in different scientific communities as a means to characterize and follow environmental changes through a set of measurements required to support policy evidence. To help track these changes, our planet has been under continuous observation from satellites since 1972. Currently, petabytes of satellite Earth observation (EO) data are freely available. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized because many big data challenges and complexity barriers hinder their effective use. Consequently, facilitating the production of EVs using the wealth of satellite EO data can be beneficial for environmental monitoring systems. In response to this issue, a comprehensive list of EVs that can take advantage of consistent time-series satellite data has been derived. In addition, a set of use-cases, using an Earth Observation Data Cube (EODC) to process large volumes of satellite data, have been implemented to demonstrate the practical applicability of EODC to produce EVs. The proposed approach has been successfully tested showing that EODC can facilitate the production of EVs at different scales and benefiting from the spatial and temporal dimension of satellite EO data for enhanced environmental monitoring.\n",Data,2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/data5040100 ,included,2020,essential variables|climate|biodiversity|water|earth observations|data cube
Valuation of Calibration for Satellite Constellations,"Siddiqi, Alfreen","Earth observation systems, consisting of in-space and air borne platforms and sensors, are providing a growing number of high resolution spatial and temporal services including agricultural crop yield predictions, local weather forecasts, and traffic management. As the complexity of these systems increases with multi-platform elements and sophisticated processing and modeling, there are also increasing avenues for introduction of errors. It is important to characterize and quantify the uncertainties and errors. Here, it shown that a value-chain approach can be used for conceptualizing errors and modeling uncertainties relevant for final decisions. This approach can then be applied for improving system value assessments and obtaining an ‘error-adjusted’ value of the remote sensing system. The error-adjusted value can be used in optimization or trade-studies for system design. This value system is then applied, as an example, to the FLARE real world calibration/validation system to look at potential Return on Investment (ROI) of better calibration to satellite image prices and market penetration.",NA,2020,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/calcon/CALCON2020/all2020content/30/,included,2020,NA
Ten rules to increase the societal value of earth observations,"Virapongse, Arika","Earth Observation (EO) data play an important role in our society today, but there is still tremendous opportunity to improve how these data are used to affect change. In this paper, we provide guidance to help data providers and intermediaries within the EO value chain (from data to applications) increase the societal value ofthe EO data, information, and data products that they work with. We first describe the EO value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit. We then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the EO value chain. Finally, we present ""10 rules"" that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of Earth science information. The 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions. Some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole. Each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points. The rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection ofsolutions. The next set ofrules are best applied throughout a project, and include such concepts as evaluation, interoperability, trust, adoption, and documentation.

Cloud services with big data provide a solution for monitoring and tracking sustainable development goals,"Wu, Bingfang","To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), high-quality data are needed to inform the formulation of policies and investment decisions, to monitor progress towards the SDGs and to evaluate the impacts of policies. However, the data landscape is changing. With emerging big data and cloud-based services, there are new opportunities for data collection, influencing both official data collection processes and the operation of the programmes they monitor. This paper uses cases and examples to explore the potential of crowdsourcing and public earth observation (EO) data products for monitoring and tracking the SDGs. This paper suggests that cloud-based services that integrate crowdsourcing and public EO data products provide cost-effective solutions for monitoring and tracking the SDGs, particularly for low-income countries. The paper also discusses the challenges of using cloud services and big data for SDG monitoring.

Assessing the full effects of public investment in space,"Clark, John","Many space-related impact studies have been carried out in the past, but there is no conclusive, comprehensive evaluation of the economic and social effects of public investments in space. Such evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in official statistics; social benefits, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts from R&D are complex and occur in the long term. However, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts. The full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a ""bottom-up"" and a ""top-down"" perspective. In the bottom-up perspective, each effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the effects. Although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields both detailed and integrated results. Our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts. Next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identified, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies. Finally, suggestions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard. The core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost benefit analysis. Effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values. For effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion. Our core recommendations are to clearly define the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies. Social, strategic and environmental impacts deserve special attention, aiming at a more comprehensive coverage of impacts. Comprehensive evaluations can contribute to more upport for space expenditures.",Space Policy,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2014.03.001,included,2020,Space investments|Impacts|Evaluation
Intangible economic benefit of remote sensing data in Indonesia,"Diana, Shinta Rahma","Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) as a space ecosystem runner government institution of the space agency in Indonesia is mandated by Indonesia space law of 2013 to carry out remote sensing activities that are not only strategic nationally in nature but also charged being benefits economically. This study investigated the intangible economic benefits of remote sensing activities in Indonesia. This research explored qualitatively the advantage of the use of remote sensing information by users obtained from the results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The conceptual framework of intangible benefit is based on the information system success model by the De-Lone and McLean Information Value model. The results showed that the quality of remote sensing was good. This can be seen from most responses of user respondents on the Perceived System Quality and Information Quality indicators giving a good rating. The response of the user respondents caused a sense of satisfaction and also caused the use of the system to be more intense.

The socio-economic value of scientific publications: The case of Earth Observation satellites,"Morretta, Valentina","This paper provides a conceptual framework to estimate the socio-economic benefits of new knowledge generated within research infrastructures from the scientific community’s perspective. We use Earth Observation (EO) satellites as a case study. Constructing, operating, and exploiting cutting-edge EO infrastructures is generating a vast amount of knowledge ultimately embodied in scientific publications. Using bibliometric and machine learning techniques, we analyse 1,235 publications in 1998–2018 related to Cosmo Skymed, the EO satellites constellation of the Italian Space Agency. Thanks to these satellites, 2,377 authors from 160 institutions and 68 countries worldwide have contributed to various subjects in several scientific fields. By using the marginal social value method in a cost-benefit analysis perspective, we conservatively estimate the value of such publications, including their marginal cost and value of citations. This original and straightforward approach can be used to estimate the socio-economic value of scientific publications produced within any research infrastructure, including universities, in any field of study.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121730,included,2020,Earth observation|Cost-benefit analysis|Research infrastructures|Marginal Social Value|Scientififc p
A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations in wildland fire suppression decisions,"Herr, Vincent","A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations is proposed and deployed. The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphere–fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexico’s 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made. We analysed the impact of Earth observations and include considerations for estimating other socioeconomic impacts.",International Journal of Wildland Fire,2020,https://doi.org/10.1071/WF18237,included,2020,fire economics|fire management|fire modelling|fire sumulation modelling|remote sensing|socioeconomic
"Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations- Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions -Group on Earth Observations side event proceedings","Pearlman, Francoise","The U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Association for Remote Sensing Companies, and the European Space Agency in coordination with the GEOValue Community hosted a side event to the Group on Earth Observations Plenary on October 23-24, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The workshop, entitled ""Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations: Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions,"" brought together more than 60 international experts including economists, scientists, and engineers to consider the state of the science and applications of valuing Earth observations (EO).\n\nThis 2-day workshop built upon previous activities developed under the GEOValue initiative. This workshop brought together expert analysts from multiple disciplines and backgrounds who are developing methods to identify and measure the value of information generated from the use of satellite and in-situ data. The mix of government agencies, international financial institutions, and independent consultants who participated in the workshop blended to develop a rich mix of views, approaches, and outcomes.\n\nDuring the first part of the workshop, the focus was on the latest science in valuing EO. A number of methodologies were described. Approaches generally assess the societal benefits of specific actions (for example, investments in EO). Some methods focus on broad measures of economic activity (for example, gross domestic product) or methods to assess total economic value such as contingent valuation surveys. Alternatively, use-case approaches (a use case is defined as an evaluation in which one or more decisions, applications, or other uses of data, information, and information products are specifically considered) start with the specific actions and how information is used to support decision making and affect outcomes. \n\nThe second part of the meeting was focused on the use and development of value chains and decision trees. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. In terms of EO, the value chain approach can be applied to consider societal benefits of the data and assess the value of data and data features. The EO value chain considers the geospatial data sources and the processing of the data into value added information to be incorporated into decision-support systems, leading to decision maker's actions. To understand the value of EO, one would also need to recognize the demand side of the equation or how EO benefits users. Extending the value chain concept and incorporating tenets of Bayesian decision making, a decision tree would include one or more use cases. The value provided by the marginal increase in information could flow from one or several parts of the supply side of the value chain. The decision tree is based on the premise that information has no value if it is not used in at least one decision. By connecting the value chain and the decision tree, a framework is created that allows for conceptualizing the value of EO in its many uses. One can then apply economic techniques to monetize the marginal benefit of an outcome with information versus one without. \n\nA third part of the meeting applied the value chain and decision-tree frameworks to five specific thematic areas, each with the focus of using information for a decision point: \n- Effect of increasing temperatures on human health; \n- Flooding- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts to safety and property damage; \n- Energy and mineral supply- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts of shortfalls on the economy; and\n- Effects of natural hazards on transportation systems- Effects on mobility, safety, and the economy.\n\nDuring the working session, five separate groups worked to define and delineate the value chains and decision trees associated with each topic, discussing the related challenges and data needs. The outcomes were reported back to the full group. Because of the complexity of the topics, most groups first identified a network of value chains and then narrowed the scope to develop a single value chain to address their group's topic. Although they worked separately and on different topics, the groups came to similar conclusions, concurring that the value chain and decision-tree frameworks are very effective for informing quantitative impact assessments and developing a relatable narrative to assist the public in understanding the link between EO and citizens.",NA,2019,https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20191033,included,2019,NA
The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response,"Oddo, Perry","Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions “on the ground” more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) fromapplying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2019,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00127,included,2019,value of information|near real-time|emergency response|applied Earth observations|socioeconomic
Benefits of the free and open Landsat data policy,"Zhu, Zhe","The United States (U.S.) federal government provides imagery obtained by federally funded Earth Observation satellites typically at no cost. For many years Landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made Landsat data accessible via the internet for free. Substantial increases in downloads of Landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, serving government, private sector, and civil society. The Landsat program hence provides an example to space agencies worldwide on the value of open access for Earth Observation data and has spurred the adaption of similar policies globally, including the European Copernicus Program. Here, we describe important aspects of the Landsat free and open data policy and highlight the importance and continued relevance of this policy.",Remote Sensing of Environment,2019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.02.016,included,2019,Open access|Land cover|Land use|Land change|Open data|Policy
Advancing the understanding and measurement of the societal benefits of Earth Observations,[ESA]European Space Agency,"The goal of this workshop was to advance valuation of the benefits from Earth Observation (EO) through case studies and through cross-fertilization with researchers, practitioners and managers from different disciplines. It brought together around 60 economists, engineers, scientists, policy makers and key personnel from space agencies and international organisations to discuss the motivations, the approaches and the challenges for valuing EO. During a dense three days programme, the participants shared ideas about areas for improvement and elaborated concrete recommendations to support the advancement of EO valuation practices. The working sessions, addressing separately different types of\nbenefits (i.e. socio-economic, socio- environmental, regulatory, on innovation and entrepreneurship and on scientific research), stimulated the participants to discuss the challenges intrinsic to the measurement of the different impacts. The splinter sessions allowed concrete and interactive discussions among small groups, whose conclusions were brought together during a final session.

Investigating the Global Socio-Economic Benefits of Satellite Industry and Remote Sensing Applications,"Alvino, Letizia","In recent years we have seen a growth in the revenues and investments of satellite industry. Originally, satellites, remote sensing (RS), and other navigations systems were only employed for government and military purposes. However, in the past two decades there has been an increase use of these tools for commercial purposes. In particular, satellites and RS can be used for space and earth observations, support military operations, precision agriculture, meteorological forecasting, communication and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking and monitoring of utility networks. In this paper, we analyse the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellites and RS. In particular, we try to identify the main socio-economic benefits deriving from the use of RS in several sectors. We also seek to introduce economists to the science of RS data, and give a flavour of how this new fountain of data can be utilized so far and what might be done in the future.",Proceedings of the 33rd IBIMA Conference,2019,https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/investigating-the-global-socio-economic-benefits-of-satellite-ind,included,2019,satellite industry|remote sensing|socio-economic benefits|satellite industry revenues
Earth Observation in a cost-benefit analysis perspective: Cosmo SkyMed satellites of the Italian Space Agency,"Clò, Stefano","Over the past decade, an increasing number of high-resolution satellite images have become available to public administration, policymakers and scientists, boosting the amount of information they can obtain to manage and analyse different issues. Satellites allow observing different natural and socio-economic phenomena that would be very hard and costly to monitor from the ground with the same optimal coverage, accuracy and consistency, providing valuable information both to the private and public sector. These phenomena include global societal challenges, such as climate change and air pollution, as well as local ones such as precision farming, urbanisation and transport infrastructures monitoring. This working paper aims at paving the way to a comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic impact of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) concerning the creation of innovative products and services generated by the Earth Observation (EO)1. Although the wide range of potential applications of EO satellite data, little is known about the effective use of Cosmo SkyMed (CSK) data so far. Most of the benefits related to their availability remain potential, unexpressed and undervalued.

Enhancing the standardized drought vulnerability index by integrating spatiotemporal information from satellite and in situ data,"Oikonomou, Panagiotis","Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.",Journal of Hydrology,2019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.058,included,2019,Drought|Drought vulnerability|Drought impacts|SDVI|Water resources|South platte
The value of remotely sensed information: the case of a GRACE-enhanced drought severity index,"Bernknopf, Richard","A decision framework is developed for quantifying the economic value of information (VOI) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission for drought monitoring, with a focus on the potential contributions of groundwater storage and soil moisture measurements from the GRACE data assimilation(GRACE-DA) system. The study consists of (i) the development of a conceptual framework to evaluate the socioeconomic value of GRACE-DA as a contributing source of information to drought monitoring; (ii) structured listening sessions to understand the needs of stakeholders who are affected by drought monitoring; (iii) econometric analysis based on the conceptual framework that characterizes the contribution of GRACE-DA to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) in capturing the effects of drought on the agricultural sector; and (iv) a demonstration of how the improved characterization of drought conditions may influence decisions made in a real-world drought disaster assistance program. Results show that GRACE-DA has the potential to lower the uncertainty associated with the understanding of drought and that this improved understanding has the potential to change policy decisions that lead to tangible societal benefits.","Weather, Climate, and Society",2018,https://doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0044.1,included,2018,NA
Improved Hydrological Decision Support System for the Lower Mekong River Basin Using Satellite-Based Earth Observations,"Mohammed, Inrahim N.","Multiple satellite-based earth observations and traditional station data along with the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model were employed to enhance the Lower Mekong River Basin region's hydrological decision support system. A nearest neighbor approximation methodology was introduced to fill the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrieval for the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (IMERG) grid points from 2001 to 2014, together with the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) data points for continuous precipitation forcing for our hydrological decision support system. A software tool to access and format satellite-based earth observation systems of precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures was developed and is presented. Our results suggest that the model-simulated streamflow utilizing TRMM and IMERG forcing data was able to capture the variability of the observed streamflow patterns in the Lower Mekong better than model-simulated streamflow with in-situ precipitation station data. We also present satellite-based and in-situ precipitation adjustment maps that can serve to correct precipitation data for the Lower Mekong region for use in other applications. The inconsistency, scarcity, poor spatial representation, difficult access and incompleteness of the available in-situ precipitation data for the Mekong region make it imperative to adopt satellite-based earth observations to pursue hydrologic modeling.",Remote Sensing,2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10060885,included,2018,Mekong River|water balance|remote sensing|SWAT|streamflow
Do users benefit from additional information in support of operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin?,"Lines, Clara","We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.",Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5901-2018,included,2018,NA
Using satellite data to fill the gaps in the US air pollution monitoring network,"Sullivan, Daniel","Compliance with the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is determined at the county level using local air pollution monitors. However, the vast majority of counties have zero or one monitor, and air pollution concentrations can vary dramatically over short distances. In addition, recent evidence suggests monitor placement may be skewed to make NAAQS compliance easier. As a result, the network of air pollution monitors may not detect all areas with pollution levels that exceed the NAAQS. This paper explores this possibility using satellite-derived data on fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) to assess NAAQS compliance for the continental United States at a 1 kilometer (km) resolution. We compare the satellite-based assessments with official attainment designations made by the terrestrial monitor network and calculate the number of people living in “misclassified” areas—areas with PM2.5 levels that exceed the NAAQS but are classified as being in attainment based on the ground monitors and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) official determination. We estimate that about 24.4 million people are living in these misclassified areas— about as many as are living in properly classified nonattainment areas—and that if such areas had sped up their PM2.5 reductions as much as nonattainment areas did, 5,452 premature deaths would have been avoided, a welfare gain to society of $49 billion.",NA,2018,https://www.rff.org/valuables/impact-assessments/,included,2018,Clean Air Act|Ambient Air Pollution|Air Pollution Minitoring
Engaging global youth in participatory spatial data creation for the UN sustainable development goals: The case of open mapping for malaria prevention,"Solís, Patricia","Practitioners bemoan lack of data as one of the biggest obstacles to progress towards global sustainable development goals. This paper explores a scaled-up participatory method developed by YouthMappers, for creating missing geospatial data derived from remotely sensed imagery in order to contribute to persistent data needs in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries. We reflect on the opportunities and challenges for how this scaled-up “remote participatory sensing” approach to spatial data creation can inform development projects in the context of the SDGs.",Applied Geography,2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.07.013,included,2018,Remote sensing|Sustainable development goals|Participatory|Open data|Malaria

Benefits and Beneficiaries of the Oklahoma Mesonet: A Multisectoral Ripple Effect Analysis,"Ziolkowska, Jadwiga R.","Since the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s automated mesoscale weather station network) was established in 1994, it has served a number of diverse groups and provided public services to foster weather preparedness, education, and public safety, while also supporting decision-making in agricultural production and wildland fire management. With 121 monitoring stations across the state, the Oklahoma Mesonet has developed an array of technologies to observe a variety of atmospheric and soil variables in 5- to 30-min intervals. These consistent observations have been especially critical for predicting and preparing for extreme weather events like droughts, floods, ice storms, and severe convective storms as well as for development of value-added tools. The tools, outreach programs, and mesoscale data have been widely utilized by the general public, state decision-makers, public safety officials, K–12 community, agricultural sector, and researchers, thus generating wide societal and economic benefits to many groups. Based on practical application examples of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet, this paper analyzes both benefits generated by Oklahoma Mesonet information to the public and decision-makers and ripple effects (spreading amplified outcomes/implications) of those benefits in the short and long term.

Free satellite imagery and digital elevation model analyses enabling natural resource management in the developing world: studies from Eastern Indonesia,"Fisher, Rohan","Decentralization of governance and natural resource management is an ongoing process in many parts of Africa and Asia. Natural resource management requires spatial land resource data for planning.

In this context, this paper explores how new opportunities provided by the increasing availability of free satellite imagery, digital elevation data and open source spatial analysis software, can be applied by local government and NGOs to conduct sophisticated natural resource mapping and modelling in ways that meet their needs and incorporates local knowledge. Reported are cases of a local government using free geospatial data and GIS software to improve evidence-based natural resource management in the developing world with a focus on raster data applications for satellite image analysis and terrain modelling. It is argued that, through removing barriers to uptake, such applications provide a means of decentralizing landscape analysis skills to improve local natural resource management.

An Analysis of the Value of Additional Information Provided by Water Quality Measurement Network,"Destandau, Francois","European Community policy concerning water is placing increasing demands on the acquisition of information about the quality of aquatic environments. The cost of this information has led to a reflection on the rationalization of monitoring networks and, therefore, on the economic value of information produced by these networks. The aim of this article is to contribute to this reflection. To do so, we used the Bayesian framework to define the value of additional information in relation to the following three parameters: initial assumptions (prior probabilities) on the states of nature, costs linked to a poor decision (error costs) and accuracy of additional information. We then analyzed the impact of these parameters on this value, particularly the combined role of prior probabilities and error costs that increased or decreased the value of information depending on the initial uncertainty level. We then illustrated the results using a case study of a stream in the Bas-Rhin department in France.",Journal of Water Resource and Protection,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/jwarp.2016.88062,included,2016,Bayesian Decision Theory|Eutrophication|Value of Information|Water Quality Monitoring Network|Water

Cost and value of multidisciplinary fixed-point ocean observatories,"Cristini, Luisa","Sustained ocean observations are crucial to understand both natural processes occurring in the ocean and human influence on the marine ecosystems. The information they provide increases our understanding and is therefore beneficial to the society as a whole because it contributes to a more efficient use and protection of the marine environment, upon which human livelihood depends. In addition the oceans, which occupy 73% of the planet surface and host 93% of the biosphere, play a massive role in controlling the climate. Eulerian or fixed-point observatories are an essential component of the global ocean observing system as they provide several unique features that cannot be found in other systems and are therefore complementary to them. In addition they provide a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, combining physical, chemical and biological observations on several time scales. The fixed-point open ocean observatory network (FixO3) integrates the 23 European open ocean fixed-point observatories in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. The programme also seeks to improve access to key installations and the knowledge they provide for the wider community, from scientists, to businesses, to civil society. This paper summarises the rationale behind open ocean observatories monitoring the essential ocean variables. It also provides an estimate of the costs to operate a typical fixed-point observatory such as those included in the FixO3 network. Finally an assessment of the type of data and services provided by ocean observations and their value to society is also given.",Marine Policy,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2016.05.029,included,2016,Ocean|Observations|Cost|Value|Services|Data

Data poverty: A global evaluation for 2009 to 2013- implications for sustainable development and disaster risk reduction,"Leidig, Mathias","The article presents a time series (2009–2013) analysis for a new version of the “Digital Divide” concept that developed in the 1990s. Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of theSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction.

Economic Assessment of the Use Value of Geospatial Information,"Bernknopf, Richard","Geospatial data inform decision makers. An economic model that involves application of spatial and temporal scientific, technical, and economic data in decision making is described. The value of information (VOI) contained in geospatial data is the difference between the net benefits (in present value terms) of a decision with and without the information. A range of technologies is used to collect and distribute geospatial data. These technical activities are linked to examples that show how the data can be applied in decision making, which is a cultural activity. The economic model for assessing the VOI in geospatial data for decisionmaking is applied to three examples: (1) a retrospective model about environmental regulation of agrochemicals; (2) a prospective model about the impact and mitigation of earthquakes in urban areas; and (3) a prospective model about developing private–public geospatial information or an ecosystem services market.

The social innovation potential of ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management,"Wehn, Uta","We live in the age of Big Data, yet many areas of environmental management are still suffering from a lack of relevant data, information and knowledge that impedes sound decision making in the face of change and increasing challenges. A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves. Moreover, given the institutional structures identified in these cases and the obligation of authorities to be accountable for their decisions, citizen observatories do not automatically imply that citizens will have a higher level of participation in flood risk management, nor that communication between stakeholders improves.",Technology in Society,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2015.05.002,included,2015,Social innovation|Citizen observatory|eParticipation|Flood risk management|Environmental management
Stakeholder Value Network (SVN) Analysis for Indian Earth Observation Program,"Sundararajan, Venkatesan","Indian Space Program operates the world’s largest constellation of civil remote-sensing satellites through its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites system. Since the founding of the nation’s space program in 1969 with the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Earth Observation through satellites has been a core objective of the Indian Space Program harnessing the space technology for national development. The IRS system supports the Indian national economy in the areas of agriculture, water resources, forestry, ecology, geology, watersheds, marine fisheries and coastal management, and advanced research in Earth Sciences. The meteorological payloads of the Indian National Satellites (INSAT) system provide for weather and natural disaster management support.\nThe IRS satellites system began in 1988 with the launch of IRS-1A satellite. The IRS series of satellites are designed and built by the ISRO Satellite Center based in Bengaluru while the ISRO Space Application Center in Ahmedabad fabricates the remote sensing payloads and cameras. The National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) based in Hyderabad is responsible for acquisition, processing and supply of data to the various national programs that utilize the remote-sensing data for optimal use of country’s national resources and water management.

Valuing Geospatial Information: Using the Contingent Valuation Method to Estimate the Economic Benefits of Landsat Satellite Imagery,"Loomis, John","While the U.S. government does not charge for downloading Landsat images, the images have value to users. This paper demonstrates a method that can value Landsat and other imagery to users. A survey of downloaders of Landsat images found: (a) established US users have a mean value of $912 USD per scene; (b) new US users and users returning when imagery became free have a mean value of $367 USD per scene. Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery. Charging a price of $100 USD a scene would result in an efficiency loss of $37.5 million a year.

Economic Benefits Expected From Earth Observation Applications. The Case Of The EU FP7 ITACA Project,"Pavone, Rosario","This paper offers a contribution of how Earth Observation Applications can give economic benefits to the community of End Users. A short overview of EO benefits is given with specific reference to cultural heritage applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the case of a EU FP7 Project ITACA (Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites), which started in January 2014 and it is currently underway. The paper briefly describes the ITACA project and its aims. During the project an economic impact assessment is carried out, initially from a qualitative point of view, through the submission of a questionnaire to the partners involved in the project. The same questionnaire was given also to identified End-Users in order to investigate the precise stakeholders' nature and behaviour and the likely economic modifications they will undergo once the project takes shape and new technical propositions are made potentially available also by way of different service models. Factors affecting positively and negatively the various stakeholder’s communities will be listed and discussed in full. Next stage is involving the quantification of potential benefits ITACA project may produce. Therefore, an evaluation of effects on economic activities of the areas and on communities the archaeological sites is being made. Once qualitative and quantitative assessments are completed, a business plan outlining also the appropriate road/roads to market is going to be prepared and suggestions will be made about which organizational/governance model best fit the expected results. This paper also deals with considerations about strength, weakness, opportunities and threats before during and after project’s deployment.

Position paper: evaluation methods and techniques,"Smart, Alan","This paper reviews methodologies in economics for valuing the benefits of geospatial data and services; including the value of open data. Section 2 explores the meaning of socioeconomic value and reviews the methodologies underpinning value assessment. It explains the theoretical background to economic welfare analysis, total turnover analysis and value added analysis. The use of different methods for economic impact assessment is then outlined. The methods include benefit cost analysis, multiplier analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling1. This section also outlines the background to value chain analysis and real options analysis. Examples of the application of these techniques are discussed. They include the application of earth observation to agricultural and water resource management and the use of mapping to improve decision making in areas such as emergency management, managing endangered species, conducting property tax assessments and verifying insurance claims. These examples illustrate the potential for geospatial data to deliver value over a wide and growing range of applications. Section 3 addresses the issues that arise in applying these techniques. It points out that the methodology selected must address the questions being asked by policy makers and/or users of geospatial data. In the current defensive fiscal environment experienced by governments in many OECD countries, it is important that the valuation method links the use of geospatial data services to a clearly defined and quantifiable outcome. There needs to be a ‘line of sight’ between application of geospatial data services and the benefits that are identified. The paper suggests that evaluations should clearly outline such relationships and suggests a hierarchy of methods that can be applied in such circumstances. The methods include cost effectiveness analysis, benefit cost analysis and regional and economy wide economic modelling. Section 4 comments on the issues that arise draws some conclusions and raises some questions for discussion. It concludes that there is a need to: align methodology to the decision maker’s needs; develop better evidence based economic assessments; adopt more structured approaches to addressing the rapid evolution in the use and application of geospatial data; develop greater capability in building better business cases; and reaching a consensus on internationally recognised methodologies. It also raises the possibility of greater international collaboration and research into building better business cases and establishing a community of experts to help advance the discipline of socioeconomic evaluation as applied to geospatial data and services.",NA,2014,https://www.geovalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Background-Position-paper-Smart1.pdf,included,2014,NA
Landsat and Water—Case Studies of the Uses and Benefits of Landsat Imagery in Water Resources,"Serbina, Larisa","The Landsat program has been collecting and archiving moderate resolution earth imagery since 1972.

Value of information for climate observing systems,"Cooke, Roger","The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system. As illustration, the VOI for the proposed spaceborne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne systems is computed. Depending on details of the decision context, the VOI ranges from 2 to 30 trillion US dollars.",Environment Systems & Decisions,2014,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-013-9451-8,included,2014,Climate observing system|Social cost of carbon|DICE|CLARREO|value of information

Bayesian framework for assessing the value of scientific space systems: value of information approach with application to earth science spacecraft,"Brathwaite, Joy","Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholders’ beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to justify the acquisition of the system. Additionally, the system is analyzed in Cost-VOD trade space to provide program managers with additional insights into the coupling of a system's predicted value generation and its associated lifecycle cost.",Acta Astronautica,2013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.10.036,included,2013,Spacecraft design|Information value|Bayesian framework|Unpriced system

We assessed the feasibility of active fire data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for monitoring fires in Laos. Specifically, we investigated the potential of the active fire data as input into monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems to assess the effectiveness of measures related to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus the enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+). Our qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessments of the fire data yielded mixed results with varying degrees of undetected fires and false detections. Hence, at IPCC Tier 3, the uncertainties inherent in the detection accuracy become too large. Active fire data can be valuable for supporting national-level MRV at Tier 2 in combination with auxiliary data for characterizing fire-dependent local land-use systems, such as shifting cultivation.",Human Ecology,2013,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-013-9565-0,included,2013,MODIS|Fire monitoring|REDD|MRV|Slash; burn|Laos
A User-Driven Approach to Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities for Societal Benefit,"Zell, Erica","In order to help data providers make informed decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of Earth observations for societal benefit, a cross-sectoral meta-analysis of observation priorities was conducted from the perspective of users. The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations’ (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users’ needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie).

An Economic Value of Remote-Sensing Information—Application to Agricultural Production and Maintaining Groundwater Quality,"Forney, W.M.","Does remote-sensing information provide economic benefits to society, and can a value be assigned to those benefits? Can resource management and policy decisions be better informed by coupling past and present Earth observations with groundwater nitrate measurements? Using an integrated assessment approach, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) applied an established conceptual framework to answer these questions, as well as to estimate the value of information (VOI) for remote-sensing imagery. The approach uses moderate-resolution land-imagery (MRLI) data from the Landsat and Advanced Wide Field Sensor satellites that has been classified by the National Agricultural Statistics Service into the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Within the constraint of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s public health threshold for potable groundwater resources, the USGS modeled the relation between a population of the CDL’s land uses and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers in a case study region in northeastern Iowa. Employing various multiscaled, multitemporal geospatial datasets with MRLI to maximize the value of agricultural production, the approach develops and uses multiple environmental science models to address dynamic nitrogen loading and transport at specified distances from specific sites (wells) and at landscape scales (for example, across 35 counties and two aquifers). In addition to the ecosystem service of potable groundwater, this effort focuses on the use of MRLI for the management of the major land uses in the study region—the production of corn and soybeans, which can impact groundwater quality. Derived methods and results include (1) economic and dynamic nitrate-pollution models, (2) probabilities of the survival of groundwater, and (3) a VOI for remote sensing. For the northeastern Iowa study region, the marginal benefit of the MRLI VOI (in 2010 dollars) is $858 million ± $197 million annualized, which corresponds to a net present value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits in perpetuity. Given that these economic estimates are derived from one case study in a part of only one State, the estimates provide a lower estimate related to the potential value of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission.",NA,2012,https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1796/,included,2012,NA
CEOS contributions to informing energy management and policy decision making using space-based Earth observations,"Eckman, Richard S.","Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS).

Program goals for the NASA/NOAA Earth observation program derived from a stakeholder value network analysis,"Sutherland, Timothy","The 2007 US National Research Council Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space was the first consensus perspective produced by the US Earth Science community of the relative priorities among a sequence of 17 satellite missions over the course of the next decade. However, the Decadal Survey only captured the perspective of the science community, leading to questions about the inclusion of broader priorities from constituent communities and stakeholders. We present a stakeholder value network analysis for the NASA/NOAA Earth Observation Program. The analysis includes a rigorous articulation of the needs and objectives of 13 major stakeholders and a complete stakeholder value network with 190 individual “value flows” that capture the interactions between all the stakeholders. It produces a novel stakeholder map, graphically indicating the outputs most likely to create a lasting Earth Science program. The most important value loops and program outputs are used to derive a set of highlevel program goals that suggest what NASA and NOAA should do, as well as how they should conduct business. The analysis concludes that international partnerships represent a strong potential partner for certain science missions with greater potential value delivery than currently-prioritized efforts with defense stakeholders and concludes that weather and land-use missions, in addition to climate missions, should be given highest priority; water, human health, and solid Earth missions should be given lower priority based on each science category’s potential for delivering value to the entire stakeholder network.",Space Policy,2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2012.09.007,included,2012,NA

Socio-Economic Benefits from the Use of Earth Observations,"Borzacchiello, Maria-Teresa","The aim of this document is to report on the workshop on “Socio-economic Benefits of Earth Observations” hold at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Ispra, on 11-13th July 2011. This workshop has been conducted as part of GEO Task US-09-02a: “Socio-Economic Benefits of GEO and GEOSS”, led by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the International Institute for Advanced Spatial Applications (IIASA), and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). It was organized by these three organizations, and by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Twenty-five experts from America, Europe and Australia have gathered in Ispra to present their experience in the field of the evaluation of the benefits from Earth Observations obtained by in-situ, remote and the new citizen’s sensors. The discussion was based on the outcomes of two previous workshops held in 2010 on the same issue, in US and in Europe. The background section presents the rationale behind the need of understanding the benefits Earth Observations, supported by several initiatives at the continental (e.g. INSPIRE Directive in Europe) and at the global (e.g. GEOSS) level. The aim of the workshop, described in the second section of this document, was to support the development of international capabilities to determine, quantify and document the socioeconomic benefits from EO and their use, and to jointly develop a programme of activities to be followed in the next few years by the research group. The foreseen activities of the programme were the consolidation of the body of literature in the field, the collection and analysis of suitable methodologies to assess Earth Observations’ benefits, and of evidence of benefits from existing case studies, the development of appropriate outreach initiatives, the strengthening of the existing community of researchers and the link with other communities of scientists, to set up multidisciplinary studies. To this aim, each participant brought his/her own experience in the analysing and assessing the impacts of Earth Observation in their own field of research, generating an interesting list of multifaceted examples and case studies in which the same problem is analysed from different perspectives. Section 3 contains a summary of each presentation, which gave the elements for the subsequent discussion among experts, leading to the preliminary programme of activities. Among the several subject of discussions there were the value to be ascribed to Earth Observation data, the need of complementing ex-ante impact assessments with monitoring and ex-post evaluations, the need of clearly communicating the benefits to policy makers in order to fund research and as well to provide a service to the society. These discussion topics are summarised in section 4, describing also the view of the experts as regard possible activities for the creation of a body of knowledge about the field, for the definition of a methodology for the estimation of Earth Observations’ benefits, the criteria for selecting suitable case studies to show such benefits and proposal for outreach and dissemination activities. As final recommendations from the workshop, priority should be given to: \n• the development of an accepted scientific paradigm and of a General Economic Framework to measure EO costs and benefits; \n• the establishment of a community of practice bringing together demand and supply; \n• the support to increase the number of researchers active in this field research group; \n• the showcase of concrete projects clearly communicating the benefits achieved. \nMoreover, concrete suggestions were given aimed at developing research activities to establish a consolidated state of the art, mainly consisting in meta-analysis of existing studies and production of high-impact articles or special issues in well-recognised scientific journals.",NA,2011,https://doi.org/10.2788/78532,included,2011,NA
Identifying Methods for Quantifying the Societal Impacts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generates tremendous value for the nation. The Agency provides critical environmental data, forecasts, cutting edge knowledge, management and stewardship that the United States needs to plan for and react to in a constantly changing global environment. The Agency, however, needs to do more to understand and measure exactly how its activities, products and services affect the well-being of the nation. Existing and emerging social science methods can be harnessed to help the Agency assess the degree to which we are meeting our mission goals and to improve the value we provide to society. The first NOAA Science Challenge workshop brought together policy makers at NOAA with social science leaders from inside and outside of the Agency to explore methods for better quantifying the ways in which NOAA affects society. As an initial step in better understanding the broader societal impacts of NOAA, we focused on the NOAA line offices and programs that deal most directly with the public: the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (including the National Sea Grant College Program), and the programs that support climate activities at NOAA (the Climate Program Office and the National Climate Data Center). While it is easy to see why society needs NOAA, the workshop revealed just how difficult it can be to rigorously quantify the societal impact of NOAA’s activities, products, and services. As a first step, the line offices identified specific NOAA products, services, and activities (outputs) for which they would like to quantify societal impacts. These examples were meant to highlight a diversity of products and services. We focused initially on relatively straightforward examples that could serve as both a departure for discussion and illustrations of how programs within the Agency might begin thinking about quantifying the societal impact of their work. For each output, the line offices developed a narrative (story) that linked the output with a sector of society and ultimately a state of societal well-being. Workshop participants further developed these stories and explored methods and approaches to better quantify how these NOAA outputs affect societal well-being. The workshop identified many methods that can be applied to better understand the way the Agency affects society. One class of methods is data denial, in which intermediate and final users of NOAA data products are asked to operate in the absence of NOAA data. Other methods involve retrospective analyses of the ways in which the public and private sector have used NOAA outputs. Still other approaches require that users imagine how their decisions would differ in the absence of NOAA activities, products and services.Table 1 provides a sampling of value chains, metrics, and methods developed at the workshop. The participants identified a variety of metrics to measure societal well-being and change including revenues, economic value, lives saved, sense of place, preferences and attitudes, property damages, and crop yields. While one day is insufficient to fully develop these methods and approaches, the workshop was an important opportunity for policy makers at NOAA and social scientists to work together to understand how the Agency can harness social science methods to do a better job of meeting its mission goals. Certain line offices are still more adept at measuring the baseline of societal well-being than in trying to tease out the contribution of any single program or activity. This corresponds, in large part, to the enterprise nature of many activities at the Agency – many programs inside and outside of the Agency combine to achieve our mission goals. As the Agency moves forward in its efforts to understand how NOAA affects society, the methods and metrics used to do so will be refined and improved. Possible next steps in the process include:\n○ More enterprise level approaches to developing value chains and valuations.\n○ Follow-up workshops or symposia on methods for quantifying the societal impacts of specific types of NOAA outputs including: research, information, and weather.",NA,2011,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353247247_NOAA_Science_Challenge_Workshop_Identifying_Methods_for_Quantifying_the_Societal_Impacts_of_the_National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration,included,2011,NA
Earth observation and the public good,"Harris, Ray","The term ‘public good’ is often used in satellite Earth observation to indicate that Earth observation data are of value or interest to the public. In fact, the term ‘public good’ has a more specific meaning, originating in the discipline of Economics, which carries with it a set of assumptions and implications about how markets operate. In this context a public good has two main characteristics: non-rivalry and nonexcludability. In their most common digital format, Earth observation data can appear to be both nonrivalrous and non-excludable. However, it is not the digital medium itself which controls the ‘publicness’ of a good but the conditions of access to that good. This paper explores the meaning of the concept of public goods in an Earth observation context by, first, examining public good theory and related concepts of categories of goods and, second, applying the concepts to nine Earth observation missions, programmes and data.",Space Policy,2011,http://doi:10.1016/j.spacepol.2011.09.010,included,2011,NA
Assessing the value of Earth observation for managing coral reefs: an example from the Great Barrier Reef,"Bouma, Jetske A.","The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reefprotection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5â€“10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.",Science of The Total Environment,2011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.07.023,included,2011,Value of information|Earth Observation|Cost-effectiveness analysis|Marine water quality management|B
Assessing the Economic Value of Early Warning Systems,"Klafft, Michael","As of today, investments into early warning systems are, to a large extent, politically motivated and “disaster driven”. This means that investments tend to increase significantly if a disaster strikes, but are often quickly reduced in the following disaster-free years. Such investment patterns make the continuous operation, maintenance and development of the early warning infrastructure a challenging task and may lead to sub-optimal investment decisions. The paper presented here proposes an economic assessment model for the tangible economic impact of early warning systems. The model places a focus on the false alert problematic and goes beyond previous approaches by incorporating some socio-cultural factors (qualitatively estimated as of now). By doing so, it supports policymakers (but also private investors) in their investment decisions related to early warning applications.",NA,2011,https://ssrn.com/abstract=1843258,included,2011,Disaster management|early warning systems|investment decisions|assessment model
Satellite earth observation value-added service in the Nigerian economy,"Musa, Zahrah","Nigeria is prone to a number of environmental problems such as: desertification, flooding, erosion, forest fires, oil spillage, mine degraded areas, fresh water pollution, deforestation, and waste management. Though these problems are being tackled by Government at different levels, pressing issues of food production and sustainability, make government to concentrate on projects that are agriculturally based. As a result, the private sector has become active in providing Satellite Earth Observation services for many ecological problems.\nA number of private companies have made their mark in the Nigerian S.E.O market. In the past, most private earth observation service companies were subsidiaries of foreign companies offering services in the construction and crude oil sectors. As the importance of remote sensing and GIS technologies became better known, the number of companies and organizations offering GIS services increased with the indigenous people also setting up smaller outfits.

Impact of Global Earth Observation –Systemic View across GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas,"Rydzak, Felicjan","The work of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is perceived as instrumental to attain sustainable development goals and to be a major driver of how the society–technology–environment system is managed. However, appropriate scientific methodologies to assess the benefits of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and validate investments in Earth observation infrastructure have been missing. This paper presents a systems approach to measure and analyze the impact of Global Earth Observation across the nine Societal Benefit Areas defined by GEO. The methodological framework presented here was developed and applied to be complete across space, time and sectors through integration and aggregation. Apart from the general assessment framework, we present some specifics of the numerical tool, which is based on System Dynamics modeling and simulation technique. Our results indicate that though the total system benefits are strongly policy dependent, improvements of GEOSS per se and data availability and interoperability, the accrued benefits are large and have a great potential shaping mankind’s course to sustainability.",International Journal of Spatial Data Infrastructures Research,2010,https://doi.org/10.2902/1725-0463.2010.05.art9,included,2010,Earth observation|benefits assessment|modeling|simulation|system dynamics
From Science to Applications: Determinants of Diffusion in the Use of Earth Observations,"Macauley, Molly","We demonstrate the diffusion in use of Earth observations data in social science research. Our study is motivated by the continuing debate among policymakers over the value of the nation’s investment in Earth observations. We also consider the role of related factors including the spread of geographical information systems (GIS; a complementary tool for using Earth observations data) and the role of data prices. We first estimate a diffusion curve and then draw from standard bibliometric methods to evaluate further the extent to which the research field is growing. We realize that these aspects of the value of Earth observations are often part of policy debate, but we offer insights into how to substantiate \nand document these claims. We find evidence of increasingly widespread use of Earth observations in an ever-widening number of applications and geographic regions. GIS and data prices influence this diffusion. However, we see less evidence of a community of practice within the large social science literature represented in our data.

The Value of Earth Observation for Managing the Great Barrier Reef,"Bouma, Jetske A.","Effective decision-making requires information, but how much information is enough and how much money should be invested in additional information is often unclear. This paper attempts to assess the economic benefits of informational investments, specifically of investments in Earth Observation (EO) for managing the Great Barrier Reef. We develop an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the expected contribution of informational investments to decision-making. We hypothesize that EO can improve decision-making by allowing for better-targeted emission reduction measures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. For assessing the benefits (cost savings) of improved targeting we develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments may affect reef quality, or emissions from certain catchments may affect reef quality more. The states reflect the current uncertainties relating to water quality management in the region. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of EO information for managing the GBR can be substantial, and depend on the perceived accuracy of EO information and on decision-makers prior beliefs.",NA,2009,https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2608005/235180.pdf,included,2009,Value of information|cost-effectiveness analysis|Earth Observation|marine water quality management|B

A professional review for integration of earth observations into FEWS NET decision support,"Ross, Kenton","The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) provides early warning support to decision makers responsible for anticipating and responding to famine and food insecurity events. This early warning system utilizes a variety of data types, including satellite remote sensing data, to assess climatic hazards that threaten adverse impacts to the food security of agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently funded activities to enhance remote sensing inputs to FEWS NET. A professional review was conducted to elicit Earth observation requirements for FEWS NET. It focused upon operational requirements of FEWS NET end-users to determine qualities of useful remote sensing data and data products. In this manner, properties of certain biophysical predictions that would be beneficial as FEWS NET supplementary inputs could be ascertained. Reviewers were asked to evaluate the importance of environmental variables and spatiotemporal requirements for Earth science data inputs, particularly for rainfall and vegetation products. The review was implemented in 2007 as an online questionnaire and was completed by more than 40 experts from around the world. This professional review questionnaire was shown to be a viable tool for the rapid derivation, compilation, and analysis of requirements necessary to enhance FEWS NET. Overall, information related to both rainfall and vegetation remotely sensed data and data products were valued most highly for providing actionable food security information.

Operational Use and Impact of Satellite Remotely Sensed Ocean Surface Vector Winds in the Marine Warning and Forecasting Environment,"Chang, Paul","In 2002, a National Oceanographic Partnership Program project was initiated with the ambitious objective of maximizing the use of currently and soon-to-be-available satellite ocean surface vector wind (OSVW) data, such as NASA’s QuikSCAT scatterometer, in the operational weather forecasting and warning environment. This effort brought together people from the operational forecasting and satellite remote-sensing communities, academia, and the private sector. This diverse gathering of skill and experience yielded documentation of the impacts of these data in the operational short-term warning and forecasting environment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Weather Service, improvement in the use of these data in the public and private sectors, and the transition of promising research results into the operational environment.

The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results.

Using architecture modeling to assess the societal benefits of the global earth observation system-of-systems,"Martin, James","An enterprise architecture for the Earth Science activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was developed to assist in assessing the capacity of scientific instruments in meeting the needs of society. It can also help them develop the right investment strategies and help scientists and engineers in their planning for system development, especially for complex space-based environmental sensors. This architecture model can be easily extended to the Global Earth Observation System-of-Systems (GEOSS). In fact, it was constructed with GEOSS in mind to ensure that NASA’s observation systems can be readily mapped into the GEOSS structure. The architecture contains about 3000 elements that are involved in earth science research: observation sources, sensors, environmental parameters, data products, mission products, observations, science models, predictions, and decision-support tools. The science models use observations from the space-based instruments to generate predictions about various aspects of the environment. These predictions are used by decision-makers around the world to help minimize property damage and loss of human life due to adverse conditions such as severe weather storms.

Banda Aceh-The Value of Earth Observation Data in Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction: A Case Study,"McCallum, Ian","On 26 December 2004, Banda Aceh in Indonesia was at the center of one of the worst natural disasters to affect mankind. Large amounts of international aid poured in to assist in the relief and reconstruction efforts. Amongst this effort, were investments in basic earth observation data from in-situ, airborne and space observations. While the use of this data is assumed to be crucial, few efforts have gone into quantifying the benefits of its acquisition. The objectives of this study were to interview a cross-section of agencies operating in Banda Aceh and across the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam on the use, sources and quality of earth observation data in the relief/reconstruction effort; and to analyze and quantify the value that earth observation data brings to the relief/reconstruction effort based on the survey results and specific examples. Key findings from the interviews point to an overall improvement in the spatial data situation since the tsunami. Problems identified included insufficient training, lack of timely data and sometimes poor spatial resolution.

Valuing Weather Observation Systems For Forest Fire Management,"Khabarov, Nikolay","Weather information is an integral part of modern fire management systems. In this paper, we investigate, by means of simulation studies, how improvements in the weather observation systems help to reduce burned area by targeting and monitoring places ripe fires are likely to occur. In our model, the air patrolling schedule is determined by the Nesterov index, which is calculated from observed weather data. We use two weather data sets based on ldquoroughrdquo and ldquofinerdquo grids. The reduction of the total burned area, associated with an air patrolling schedule based on the ldquofinerdquo grid, indicates the benefits of using better weather observations. We, also, consider a stochastic model to simulate forest fires and explore the sensitivity of the model with respect to the quality of input data. Finally, we investigate the system of systems effect.

A Conceptual Framework for Assessing the Benefits of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems,"Fritz, Steffen","The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “benefit chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.",IEEE Systems Journal,2008,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2008.926688,included,2008,Benefit assessment|conceptual framework|cost-benefit analysis|Global Earth Observation System-of-Sys
Potential benefits of coastal ocean observing systems to Alaskan commercial fisheries,"Wellman, Katharine","In this article we attempt to illustrate the potential benefits to Alaskan commercial fisheries expected from enhancements to the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) through changes in fishery management strategies. In particular we show how the use of improvedAOOSdata in research, stockassessment, andultimately fisheriesmanagement has the potential to result in significant benefits in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish and Kodiak king crab fisheries. We show through a case study approach that information such as might be provided by an enhanced AOOS could conceivably contribute over $600 million in additional annual revenue in Alaska’s groundfish fishery. In addition we estimate that had the information from such a system been available in the 1970s and 1980s the Kodiak king crab stock collapse could have been avoided and $60 million in annual revenues generated. Benefit estimates (as measured by revenue increases) are based on the assumptions that when better data is delivered those data will be integrated into stock assessment models; when better data are integrated into the models the new data will actually improve the reliability of the models; and when the reliability of the models is improved predictions will be accepted by managers or industry members.",Coastal Management,2008,https://doi.org/10.1080/08920750701868051,included,2008,Alaska fisheries|coastal observing systems|economic benefits|value of information
Assimilation of GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Data into a Land Surface Model: Results for the Mississippi River Basin,"Zaitchik, Benjamin","Assimilation of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system of satellites yielded improved simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River basin, as evaluated against independent measurements. The authors assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies for each of the four major subbasins of the Mississippi into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) using an ensemble Kalman smoother from January 2003 to May 2006. Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.",Journal of Hydrometeorology,2008,https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JHM951.1,included,2008,Land surface model|Rivers|Satellite observations|Data assimilation|Kalman filters|Hydrologic models
Ascribing societal benefit to applied remote sensing data products: an examination of methodologies based on the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer experience,"Macauley, Molly","This paper describes and illustrates frameworks for societal benefits associated with data products from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), one of five instruments launched into polar orbit aboard NASA's Terra spacecraft in December 1999.

The survey urges that all missions explicitly identify potential societal benefits in mission planning and operation. In this paper, our retrospective look at MISR offers approaches which mission planning for future instruments could operationalize. ""Societal benefit"" generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit.

The value of information: Measuring the contribution of space-derived earth science data to resource management,"Macauley, Molly K.","Governments around the world, as well as private industry, invest heavily in remote sensing spacecraft to obtain data about natural and environmental resources, climate change, and the relationship of earth science to human health and quality of life. Numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments. The studies use a wide variety of methods and generally find a large range of benefits, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies. This article offers a general framework for measuring the value of information. The framework serves two purposes. One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data. Decision makers comprise three communities: consumers and producers of information, public officials whose job is to invest in data acquisition and information development (including sensors and other hardware, algorithm design and software tools, and a trained labor force), and the public at large.",Space Policy,2006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2006.08.003,included,2006,NA
Integrating Earth observation data into geospatial databases that support public health decisions,"Morain, S.A.","There are several reasons why public health communities do not use information from Earth observations routinely. Most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads. The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the United States. Several Earth observations (EO) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement. Output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Eta version) model (NCEP/Eta). Simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by NCEP/Eta’s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based Continuous Air Monitoring System (CAMS). The simulations were rerun after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from MODIS (MOD-12). For the CAMS test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns. Additional EO data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from SRTM, dustgenerating areas derived from MOD-15’s Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, soil moisture data from AMSR-E, and aerodynamic surface roughness. Ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence.","International Archive of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",2006,https://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVI/part4/WG-VIII-2-2.pdf,included,2006,Earth observation|System integration|Internet GIS|Public health/medical|Environmental monitoring|Spa
Ascribing Societal Benefit to Environmental Observations of Earth from Space,"Macauley, Molly","At the request of managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this paper describes frameworks for and illustrates societal benefits associated with Earth observations from an experimental satellite known as the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). MISR is a unique camera that images Earth's atmosphere and other characteristics simultaneously from nine angles. This multiangle perspective enhances our ability to measure and monitor dimensions of climate, weather, air quality, natural hazards, and the biosphere. ""Societal benefit"" in this paper generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit. The paper has two objectives: to demonstrate how several societal benefit frameworks work, and to highlight some of these benefits in the case of MISR. Such consideration of practical benefits is timely, as their realization is becoming a prominent objective of future space remote sensing activities. At least four groups of experts recommend that societal benefit serve as a heavily weighted criterion for prioritizing Earth science research opportunities. The National Academy of Sciences' forthcoming decadal survey for U.S. Earth science applications from space, the U.S. Climate Change Research Program, the framework for the international Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS), and the new world water program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) all argue that societal benefit should be a determining factor in selecting the next Earth-observing spacecraft missions and instruments. If these recommendations are implemented, the frameworks and illustrations below may prove useful in guiding benefit descriptions in future space-derived Earth observation programs.",NA,2006,https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.901785,included,2006,environmental management|earth observations|earth science; societal benefits|resource
Future earth observation strategy for societal benefits,"Zhou, Guoqing","This invited paper presents the future intelligent observing system (FIEOS) and event-driven earth observation concepts as well as their connections to societal benefits for both decision-makers and the general public. The elucidated linkage and flow of information from FIEOS to societal benefits is interoperable. With the envisioned FIEOS, this paper places an emphasis on (i) How to apply the FIEOS to increase the efficiency of monitoring natural disaster, to improve the natural disaster management, and to mitigate disasters through providing highly accurate, and reliable surveillance data for experts, analysts, and decision-makers; (ii) How to significantly increase and extend societal benefits to the future U.S. Earth observation application strategy in, for example, realtime response to time-critical events, and disastrous environmental monitoring. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of FIEOS to society benefit in the realms: (i) reducing loss of life and property from natural and human-induced disasters, (ii) improving human health and well-being, (iii) improving wealth forecasting, (iv) supporting sustainable agriculture, and (v) serving lay people.",NA,2005,https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2005.1526433,included,2005,Earth|Monitoring|Intelligent systems|Intelligent sensors|Humans| Satellite broadcasting|Time factors
The potential value of improved ocean observation systems in the Gulf of Mexico,"Kaiser, Mark","A number of coastal and ocean observation systems exist throughout the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), but the network of systems is\nnot currently linked or integrated and at present not fully implemented. The network of local systems are diverse, typically involving\nunique mandates and several different funding sources at various levels of permanence. The purpose of this paper is to describe the\nocean observation systems that currently exist in the GOM, and to identify and quantify the expected economic benefits that may\nresult from the implementation of an integrated regional network. Improved ocean observation systems are expected to reduce the\nuncertainty of ocean/weather forecasting and to enhance the value of ocean/weather information throughout the Gulf region. The\nsource of benefits and the size of activity from which improved ocean observation benefits may be derived are estimated for private\nsector, non-market, and public sector activities categorized according to marine transportation, commercial fishing, recreational\nfishing, search and rescue operations, and pollution management. The benefits of improved ocean observation systems to energy\nexploration, development, and production activities are estimated, and a discussion of potential benefits to lightering activities,\nenvironmental monitoring, royalty payments, and engineering design are highlighted.\nr 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A Cost-Benefit Analysis of The National Map,"Halsing, David","The Geography Discipline of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted this cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of The National Map. This analysis is an evaluation of the proposed Geography Discipline initiative to provide the Nation with a \nmechanism to access current and consistent digital geospatial data. This CBA is a supporting document to accompany the Exhibit 300 Capital Asset Plan and Business Case of The National Map Reengineering Program. \nThe framework for estimating the benefits is based on expected improvements in processing information to perform any of the possible applications of spatial data. This analysis does not attempt to determine the benefits and costs of performing geospatial-data applications. Rather, it estimates the change in the differences between those benefits and costs with The National Map and the current situation without it. The estimates of total costs and benefits of The National Map were based on the projected implementation time, development and maintenance costs, rates of data inclusion and integration, expected usage levels over time, and a benefits estimation model. \nThe National Map provides data that are current, integrated, consistent, complete, and more accessible in order to decrease the cost of implementing spatial-data applications and (or) improve the outcome of those applications. The efficiency gains in per-application improvements are greater than the cost to develop and maintain The National Map, meaning that the program would bring a positive net benefit to the Nation. The average improvement in the net benefit of performing a spatial data application was multiplied by a simulated number of application implementations across the country. The numbers of users, existing applications, and rates of application implementation increase over time as The National Map is developed and accessed by spatial data users around the country",NA,2004,https://doi.org/10.3133/cir1271,included,2004,NA
The socioeconomic benefits of Earth science and applications research: reducing the risks and costs of natural disasters,"Williamson, Ray A.","A wealth of satellite data has provided information on weather and climate phenomena for the past 40 years. Within this period, however, the heavy human and economic costs of natural disasters have increased considerably. Using hurricanes, droughts, floods and earthquakes which occurredin the USA as examples, this article describes how Earth science can be appliedto such situations to predict or mitigate their effects. The economic value of providing such information is discussed, as are the issues that can affect how successful its provision will be.",Space Policy,2002,PII: S 0265-9646(01)00057-1,included,2002,NA

A benefit-cost analysis of a regional global ocean observing system: Seawatch Europe,"Stel, Jan H.","The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a joint effort of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, the World Meteorological Organlsation (WMO) and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). GOOS will provide long-term ocean data based on a globally coordinated strategy. These data will be used for climate forecasting. The Seawatch Europe project of the European Marine environment programme (EUROMAR) Is an on-line monitoring and surveillance system of the North Sea and Is a regional component of GOOS. Seawetch forecasts and environmental data are distributed to public authorities, aquecuiture/fish farming, commercial fishing, tourist Industry, research Institutes, navy and coastguards. The Seawatch system Is now operative In Norway and Thailand. it is at present Installed In Spain, and Indonesia Seawatch has aroused considerable Interest In Sweden, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Mexico, China, Korea and the USA. In this paper some of the results of a benefit-coat analysis of the Seawatch System are discuseed. So far the main revenues occur in the oll and gas exploitation, commercial flsherless end fish farming, tourism, meteorological forecasting, crises management etc. It is calculated that in the North Sea, a delay of 105 minutes in startup of the productional of a well will cover the costs of Seawatch. The global potential for the Seawatch System in the Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a running cost of $100 million per year. A strong point of the Seawatch system is that it is commercially off-the-shelf technology. Seawatch is, however, still competing with academic and governmental institutions for funds when viewed as either a research venture or an operational programme. It is important for public authorities at the national and international level to participate in Seawatch and help to steer it towards the potential it was designed to fulfil namely a building stone of GOOS.",Marine Policy,1996,https://doi.org/10.1016/0308-597X(96)00029-2,included,1996,NA
Agricultural Producers' Willingness to Pay for Real-Time Mesoscale Weather Information,"Kenkel, Phil","Mesoscale weather networks can provide improved weather information to agricultural producers. This technology can potentially improve production decisions, reduce irrigation and pesticide inputs, and reduce weather-related losses. Developing a mesoscale network to disseminate real-time mesoscale weather information requires a substantial investment. In addition, there are costs associated with maintenance of the system and distribution of the information available. While public funds may be available to support initial development of the system, there may be less public support for maintaining the system and subsidizing users' access to the information. This study uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of Oklahoma farmers and ranchers, as one set of potential users, to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information. The results indicate that agricultural producers are willing to pay only a modest fee for improved weather information. Gross sales, irrigation, and past weather losses are among the factors shown to significantly impact willingness to pay.",Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,1995,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40987744,included,1995,contingent valuation|decision aids|mesoscale weather information
