Using Bioacoustics To Enhance The Efficiency Of Spotted Owl Surveys And Facilitate Forest Restoration,"The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an older-forest associated species that resides at the center of forest management planning in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, USA, which are experiencing increasingly large and severe wildfires and drought-related tree mortality. We leveraged advances in passive acoustic survey technologies to develop an acoustically assisted survey design that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project-level surveys for spotted owls, allowing surveys to be completed in a single year instead of in multiple years. We deployed an array of autonomous recording units (ARUs) across a landscape and identified spotted owl vocalizations in the resulting audio using BirdNET. We then evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in spotted owl vocalizations near occupied territories and the ability of a crew naïve to the location of occupied territories to locate spotted owls based on patterns of acoustic detections. After only 3 weeks of acoustic surveys, ≥1 ARU within 750 m of all 17 occupied territories obtained spotted owl detections across ≥2 nights. When active surveys using broadcast calling were conducted near ARUs with spotted owl detections by surveyors naïve to territory occupancy status and locations, surveyors located owls in 93% to 100% of occupied territories with ≤3 surveys. To further improve the efficiency of spotted owl surveys, we developed a statistical model to identify and prioritize areas across the Sierra Nevada for different survey methods (active only, acoustically assisted, no surveys) based on the expected probability of occupancy predicted from remotely sensed measurements of tree height and historical occupancy. Depending on managers' tolerance for false negatives, this model could help identify large areas that might not benefit from surveys based on low expected occupancy probabilities and areas where acoustically assisted surveys might enhance survey effectiveness and efficiency. Collectively, these findings can help managers streamline the survey process and thus increase the pace of forest restoration while minimizing potential near-term adverse effects on California spotted owls. © 2023 The Authors.

"Modelling And Evaluation Of Land Use Changes Through Satellite Images In A Multifunctional Catchment: Social, Economic And Environmental Implications","Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. ""S-Upstream"", ""S-Downstream"" and ""S-Total"". Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11\%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3\% for S-Up; 8.6\% for S-Down and 13\% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101777,{},included,NA
"On The Future Of Argo: A Global, Full-Depth, Multi-Disciplinary Array","The Argo Program has been implemented and sustained for almost two decades, as a global array of about 4000 profiling floats. Argo provides continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar. The successful installation of the Argo array and its innovative data management system arose opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and technological innovation. Through the data system, Argo provides fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of autonomous profiling floats. Following recent advances in platform and sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years ago to (i) improve Argo's global coverage and value beyond the original design, (ii) extend Argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to global implementation is described. The objective is to create a fully global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary Argo Program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in situ elements of the Global Ocean Observing System (Legler et al., 2015). The integrated system will deliver operational reanalysis and forecasting capability, and assessment of the state and variability of the climate system with respect to physical, biogeochemical, and ecosystems parameters. It will enable basic research of unprecedented breadth and magnitude, and a wealth of ocean-education and outreach opportunities.",2019,"{""Alford, Matthew H."",""Bakker, Dorothee"",""Baringer, Molly"",""Belbeoch, Mathieu"",""Bittig, Henry C."",""Boss, Emmanuel"",""Calil, Paulo"",""Carse, Fiona"",""Carval, Thierry"",""Chai, Fei"",""Claustre, Herve"",""Conchubhair, Diarmuid O."",""Dall'Olmo, Giorgio"",""Desbruyeres, Damien"",""Fennel, Katja"",""Fer, Ilker"",""Ferrari, Raffaele"",""Forget, Gael"",""Freeland, Howard"",""Fujiki, Tetsuichi"",""Garabato, Alberto Naveira"",""Gehlen, Marion"",""Greenan, Blair"",""Hallberg, Robert"",""Hibiya, Toshiyuki"",""Hosoda, Shigeki"",""Jayne, Steven"",""Jochum, Markus"",""Johnson, Gregory C."",""Johnson, Kenneth"",""Kang, KiRyong"",""King, Brian"",""Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas"",""Kortzinger, Arne"",""Le Traon, Pierre-Yves"",""Lenn, Yueng-Djern"",""Maze, Guillaume"",""Mork, Kjell Arne"",""Morris, Tamaryn"",""Moum, James"",""Nagai, Takeyoshi"",""Nash, Jonathan"",""Oke, Peter"",""Olsen, Are"",""Owens, W.

Remote Sensing Agricultural Crop Type For Sustainable Development In South Africa,"Effective water resource management improves food production and consents scare water resources, especially in developing countries such as South Africa. The goal of this project was to assist the Republic of South Africa Department of Water Affairs & Forestry to identify a cost-effective remote sensing methodology to accurately measure and monitor agricultural land use for National Water Act water management purposes. The most accurate results were obtained using object-oriented image segmentation techniques applied to SPOT multispectral and panchromatic data (overall accuracy = 89.41%). Accurate classifications were also obtained using just the SPOT multispectral data (85.33%). When applied to Landsat ETM+ and TM data in 2003 and 2005, the image segmentation approach out-performed all other algorithms yielding classification accuracies of 85.71% and 84. 30%, respectively. This is important because Landsat TM type data cover more geography (e.g., 185 & 185 km) than SPOT data (e.g., 60 × 60 km) and are more economical per km2. These findings are of value to the Republic of South Africa as well as other countries throughout Africa that are trying to implement National Water Acts that rely on remote sensing to provide some of the critical land cover information.",NA,NA,10.1080/10106040608542378,{},included,NA
Spatial Coverage Of Monitoring Networks: A Climate Observing System Simulation Experiment,"Observing systems consisting of a finite number of in situ monitoring stations can provide high-quality measurements with the ability to quality assure both the instruments and the data but offer limited information over larger geographic areas. This paper quantifies the spatial coverage represented by a finite set of monitoring stations by using global data-data that are possibly of lower resolution and quality. For illustration purposes, merged satellite temperature data from Microwave Sounding Units are used to estimate the representativeness of the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN). While many metrics exist for evaluating the representativeness of a site, the ability to have highly accurate monthly averaged data is essential for both trend detection and climatology evaluation. The calculated correlations of the monthly averaged upper-troposphere satellite-derived temperatures over the GRUAN stations with all other pixels around the globe show that the current 9 certified GRUAN stations have moderate correlations (r >= 0.7) for approximately 10\% of the earth, but an expanded network incorporating another 15 stations would result in moderate correlations for just over 60\% of the earth. This analysis indicates that the value of additional stations can be quantified by using historical, satellite, or model data and can be used to reveal critical gaps in current monitoring capabilities. Evaluating the value of potential additional stations and prioritizing their initiation can optimize networks. The expansion of networks can be evaluated in a manner that allows for optimal benefit on the basis of optimization theory and economic analyses.",NA,NA,10.1175/jamc-d-17-0040.1,"{""probably not""}",included,NA
Sar And Lidar Temporal Data Fusion Approaches To Boreal Wetland Ecosystem Monitoring,"The objective of this study was to develop a decision-based methodology, focused on data fusion for wetland classification based on surface water hydroperiod and associated riparian (transitional area between aquatic and upland zones) vegetation community attributes. Multi-temporal, multi-mode data were examined from airborne Lidar (Teledyne Optech, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, Titan), synthetic aperture radar (Radarsat-2, single and quad polarization), and optical (SPOT) sensors with near-coincident acquisition dates. Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA). The methodology was repeated in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) to determine the transferability of the methods to other boreal environments. Water mask frequency analysis showed accuracies of 93\% to 97\%, and kappa values of 0.8-0.9 when compared to optical data. Concordance results comparing the semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 were found to be 98\% similar, suggesting little change in wetland surface water extent between these two years. The results illustrate that the decision-based methodology and data fusion could be applied to a wide range of boreal wetland types and, so far, is not geographically limited. This provides a platform for land use permitting, reclamation monitoring, and wetland regulation in a region of rapid development and uncertainty due to climate change. The methodology offers an innovative time series-based boreal wetland classification approach using data fusion of multiple remote sensing data sources.",2019,"{""Brisco, Brian"",""Chasmer, Laura"",""Cobbaert, Danielle"",""Devito, Kevin"",""Hopkinson, Chris"",""Montgomery, Joshua""}",10.3390/rs11020161,{maybe?},included,NA
Mapping For Coral Reef Conservation: Comparing The Value Of Participatory And Remote Sensing Approaches,"Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66\%; RS: 76\%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.",NA,NA,10.1002/ecs2.1325,{},included,NA
Monitoring Canopy Quality And Improving Equitable Outcomes Of Urban Tree Planting Using Lidar And Machine Learning,"Urban tree canopies are fundamental to mitigating the impacts of climate change within cities as well as providing a range of other important ecosystem, health, and amenity benefits. However, urban tree planting initiatives do not typically utilize data about both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the tree canopy, despite height being a critical determinant of the quality and value of urban canopy cover. We present a novel pipeline that uses airborne LiDAR data to train a multi-task machine learning model to generate estimates of both canopy cover and height in urban areas. We apply this to multi-source multi-spectral imagery for the case study of Chicago, USA. Our results indicate that a multi-task UNet convolutional neural network can be used to generate reliable estimates of canopy cover and height from aerial and satellite imagery. We then use these canopy estimates to allocate 75,000 trees from Chicago's recent green initiative under four scenarios, minimizing the urban heat island effect and then optimizing for an equitable canopy distribution, comparing results when only canopy cover is used, and when both canopy cover and height are considered. Through the introduction of this novel pipeline, we show that including canopy height within decision-making processes allows the distribution of new trees to be optimised to further reduce the urban heat island effect in localities where trees have the highest cooling potential and allows trees to be more equitably distributed to communities with lower quality canopies.",2023,"{""Disney, Mathias"",""Francis, John"",""Law, Stephen""}",10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128115,{},included,NA
Sentinel-1 Snow Depth Retrieval At Sub-Kilometer Resolution Over The European Alps,"Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017-2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%-30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.",NA,NA,10.5194/tc-16-159-2022,"{validation,""probably not""}",included,NA
Vermont Global Warming Solutions Act: The Costs Of Inaction From Land Conversions,"The Vermont (VT) Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA, 2020) sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets at 26\% below 2005 by 2025, 40\% below 1990 by 2030 and 80\% below 1990 by 2050 for energy-related emissions only. Vermont's omission of GHG emissions from land conversions could result in significant costs of inaction (COI), which could hinder the state's mitigation and adaptation plans and result in climate crisis-related risks (e.g., credit downgrade). Science-based spatio-temporal data of GHG emissions from soils because of land conversions can be integrated into the conceptual framework of ""action"" versus ""inaction"" to prevent GHG emissions. The application of soil information data and remote sensing analysis can identify the GHG emissions from land conversions, which can be expressed as ""realized"" social costs of ""inaction"". This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for VT by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. These results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions, which can be linked to VT's climate action plan. A failure to considerably reduce emissions from land conversions would increase climate change costs and potential legal consequences for VT and beyond its borders.",NA,NA,10.3390/laws11030048,{},included,NA
Enhancing Land Cover Mapping And Monitoring: An Interactive And Explainable Machine Learning Approach Using Google Earth Engine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been applied to solve various remote sensing problems. To fully leverage the power of AI and ML to tackle impactful remote sensing problems, it is essential to enable researchers and practitioners to understand how AI and ML models actually work and thus to improve the model performance strategically. Accurate and timely land cover maps are essential components for informed land management decision making. To address the ever-increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution maps, this paper developed an interactive and open-source online tool, in Python, to help interpret and improve the ML models used for land cover mapping with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The tool integrates the workflow of both land cover classification and land cover change dynamics, which requires the generation of a time series of land cover maps. Three feature importance metrics are reported, including impurity-based, permutation-based, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) value-based feature importance. Two case studies are presented to showcase the tool's capability and ease of use, enabling a globally accessible and free convergent application of remote sensing technologies.

"The Gavkhouni Wetland Dryness And Its Impact On Air Temperature Variability In The Eastern Part Of The Zayandeh-Rud River Basin, Iran","The Gavkhouni wetland provides many environmental and economic benefits for the central region of Iran. In recent decades, it has completely dried up several times with substantial impacts on local ecosystems and climate. Remote sensing-based Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in combination with in-situ data were used to investigate the trend of the Gavkhouni wetland dryness and the associated impact on the variability of local air temperature. The results indicate that the wetland has increasingly experienced drier conditions since the year 2000. The wetland was almost completely dry in 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017. In addition, the results show that Gavkhouni wetland dryness has a significant impact on local climate, increasing the mean seasonal air temperature by ~1.6◦ C and ~1◦ C in spring and summer, respectively. Overall, this study shows that remote sensing imagery is a valuable source for monitoring dryness and air temperature variations in the region. Moreover, the results provide a basis for effective water allocation decisions to maintain the hydrological and ecological functionality of the Gavkhouni wetland. Considering that many factors such as latitude, cloud cover, and the direction of prevailing winds affect land surface and air temperatures, it is suggested to use a numerical climate model to improve a regional understanding of the effects of wetland dryness on the surrounding climate. © 2022 by the authors.

A Data-Driven Approach To Hurricane Debris Modeling,"The large amount of debris generated in the aftermath of hurricane and storm events can cause severe financial and logistical burdens to coastal communities. Existing debris estimation models mainly focus on wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50\%, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that can account for other types of debris while improving accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic framework to estimate the presence and amount of waterborne debris following a severe storm using machine learning (ML) techniques as a function of relevant storm and landcover parameters. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models, employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris removal database for Hurricane Ike, respectively. The results show that the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a misclassification error of 5.56\% for the debris presence predictive model, and a normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 11.98 for the debris volume model, the lowest RMSE of the tested algorithms. Dual-layer ML models are also investigated, incorporating the debris presence as a predictor in the debris volume model. The results show a percent error of 11.29\% for the dual-layer model and an approximately 5.4\% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not incorporate debris presence. The generated debris volume and presence models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource allocation following a storm event.",NA,NA,10.1061/jwped5.wweng-1945,"{""probably not""}",included,NA

A New Method For Long-Term River Discharge Estimation Of Small- And Medium-Scale Rivers By Using Multisource Remote Sensing And Rshs: Application And Validation,"River discharge is an important hydrological parameter of river water resources. Especially in small- and medium-scale rivers, data deficiency is the biggest problem for studies of river discharge. In recent years, remote sensing has become a rapid and convenient method to estimate river discharge. However, remote sensing images still have some difficulty generating continuous long-term river discharge. To address this problem, we developed a new method coupling the remote sensing hydrology station method (RSHS) with statistical regression downscaling, using data from optical satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), radar satellites (Sentinel-1), and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We applied this method to monitor monthly river discharge for small- and medium-scale rivers from 2016 to 2020 on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and evaluated the accuracy of the results. The results show that (1) by applying the newly constructed method, the water body continuity index obtained by Landsat-8 increased by 7\% and the average river length percentage in the channel reached 90.7\%, a 40\% increase; (2) there were only 10 river flow data points, on average, in the 5-year period obtained before this method was applied; after this method was applied, more than 50 river flow data points could be obtained, on average, extending the quantity of data fivefold; in addition, improper extreme values could also be avoided; (3) with better continuity of water body distribution, the images provided steadier river widths. The relative error of daily flow estimation from Landsat-8 images was reduced by 60\% and the mean percentage error was reduced by one-fourth. The relative error of the multisource remote sensing composited flow was reduced by 37\% with a reduction in the mean percentage error of over a half; (4) in addition, we found that when the threshold difference between water bodies and land in remote sensing images is more than 0.2, the impact of water body recognition error on flow accuracy can be ignored. This method helps to overcome the absence of remote sensing methods for the long-term estimation of flow series in small- and medium-scale rivers, improves the accuracy of remote sensing methods for calculating flow, and provides ideas for regional water resource management and utilization.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14081798,"{""probably not"",maybe}",included,NA
"Evaluating Remote Sensing Approaches For Mapping The Bathymetry Of Lake Manzala, Egypt","Lake Manzala is considered the largest lagoon in Egypt. The lake has significant economic and environmental impacts that should be managed based on management models. The bathymetry of this lake, which is time consuming and laborious to obtain in the field, is one of the key input files for developing hydrological models of the lake. Remote sensing technology is used to determine satellite bathymetric maps with reasonable accuracy. The objective of the present work was to utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to determine the bathymetry of Lake Manzala. Generalized linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, bagging (BAG, an ensemble regression algorithm), least-squares boosting fitting ensemble (LSB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used in this study to process the images and manage the database of each image. The Landsat images were corrected for atmospheric conditions and the sunglint effect. Then values from the logarithms of corrected reflectance bands (coastal, blue, green, and red) and their ratio logarithms at locations corresponding to GPS surveys were extracted. Two assessing metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation (R), were used to calibrate the derived logarithm values for the model using observed data for the lake. The results show that the BAG and decision tree approaches perform well for Lake Manzala. Such methodologies should be applied for bathymetry determination, especially for shallow lakes, to save monitoring effort and costs. This approach facilitates the development of management models for lakes.",NA,NA,10.1007/s41207-021-00285-0,{maybe},included,NA
Design Of Terrace Drainage Networks Using Uav-Based High-Resolution Topographic Data,"Hillslope viticulture has a long history in Mediterranean Europe, and still holds important cultural and economic value. Steep hillsides have widely been levelled by terraces, in order to control surface water flow and facilitate cultivation. However, under unsustainable management and growing rainfall aggressiveness, terraced vineyards have become one of the most erosion-prone agricultural landscapes. The Valcamonica valley in Lombardy (Italy) presents a typical example of an ancient wine production region where rural land abandonment has previously caused widespread degradation of the traditional terracing systems. Recently, a local revival of wine production led to restoration plans of the terraces and their drainage functioning, to safeguard productivity and hydrogeologic safety. In this study, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey was carried out to reconstruct an accurate and precise 3D terrain model of a Valcamonica vineyard through photogrammetry. The resulting high-resolution topographic data allowed insights of surface flow-induced soil erosion patterns based on the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII). Three diverse drainage networks were designed and digitally implemented, allowing scenario analysis of the costs and benefits in terms of potential erosion mitigation. The presented methodology could likely improve the time-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of similar restoration plans in degraded landscapes.",2019,"{""Pijl, Anton"",""Roder, Giulia"",""Sofia, Giulia"",""Tarolli, Paolo"",""Tosoni, Michele""}",10.3390/w11040814,{},included,NA
"Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, And Learning (Meal) In Anticipatory Action-Earth Observation As A Game Changer","For many decades, humanitarian assistance relied on emergency response, triggering both funding and operational activities only after disaster impacts had been recorded. In recent years, many humanitarian actors have joined forces to complement traditional, reactive mechanisms with a forward-looking approach that can be activated before a disaster strikes. Anticipatory action (AA) uses forecasts of extreme weather events and combines them with risk information to identify and implement locally-led early actions with the goal of protecting lives and livelihoods more efficiently. AA is still a relatively new approach. Hence, monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL) is crucial to measure its effectiveness and adjust where necessary, as well as for (government) donors that want to see the added value of their investment maximized. However, evidence-based studies that investigate potential limitations and the exact impact pathway of AA at household level are time-consuming, costly, and therefore scarce. Satellite earth observation can become a game changer in AA by strengthening the evidence base via rapid, low-cost assessments. Both commercial and freely available satellite-derived data have reached an unprecedented level of quality, spatial, and temporal resolution. Simultaneously, there are major uncertainties regarding where, when, how, and under what conditions satellite data can support MEAL for AA at all. We argue that satellite data for an advanced MEAL framework should be considered already in the design phase of AA projects and that the translation of satellite data into actionable information will require a cross-cutting community of practice.",NA,NA,10.3389/fclim.2022.923852,{},included,NA
Mapping A Specific Class For Priority Habitats Monitoring From Satellite Sensor Data,"The European Union's Habitats Directive aims to protect biodiversity through the conservation of habitats. If a habitat of interest corresponds to spectrally separable land cover class(es), then this activity can benefit from the production of accurate land cover maps from remotely sensed imagery. Traditionally, the image classification techniques used assume that the set of classes has been defined exhaustively, which requires all of the classes in the region to be included explicitly in the analysis. Often, however, interest focuses on just one or a small sub-set of the classes occurring in the region that represent the habitat(s) of particular interest. Moreover, given that the size of a training set required for an image classification is typically taken to be a function of the number of classes and discriminating variables (e. g. wavebands) used in the classification, the satisfaction of the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes requires that much effort is directed wastefully on classes of little, if any, direct interest. Savings in training could be achieved by focusing on the class(es) of specific interest. A more appropriate approach for mapping a specific class may be to adopt a binary classification analysis that simply seeks to separate the class of interest from all others. In this way the analysis focuses on the class(es) of interest and a small training set may be used. An attractive means to achieve this is through the adoption of decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches to classification. This paper evaluates the accuracy with which a habitat of interest to the EU Habitats Directive, fen, can be mapped from Landsat ETM+ imagery of the Norfolk Broads using such classifiers as well as, for comparative purposes, a standard maximum likelihood decision rule implemented by a discriminant analysis. All analyses yielded accurate classifications, with a conventional approach based on a maximum likelihood allocation providing an overall classification accuracy of 88.4\%. However, both the decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches provided classifications that were significantly more accurate than conventional maximum likelihood classification (p < 0.05), with overall accuracies of 91.6 and 93.6\%, respectively (table 3). The results highlight the ability to focus the analysis on the class of interest in a manner that is less wasteful of resources and effort and that yields a more accurate classification than the standard approach.",2006,"{""Boyd, Doreen S."",""Foody, Giles M."",""Sanchez-Hernandez, Carolina""}",10.1080/01431160600554348,{maybe},included,NA
Satellite-Based Crop Production Monitoring In Ukraine And Regional Food Security,"Every year weather vagaries have caused shortfalls of agricultural production regionally and every 3-4 years these shortfalls occurred globally. Therefore, early assessment of crop losses in response to weather fluctuations is an important task for the estimation of global, regional and countries food supply/demand, donor's decision to assists the nations in need and to those receiving the assistance. The new satellite-based technology has been recently developed to provide timely and accurate crops' monitoring and assessments. This technology includes the theory, algorithm, data base and operational implementation of vegetation health (VH) assessments from observations provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on NOAA operational polar-orbiting satellites. Several AVHRR-based VH indices were developed and used to provide weekly cumulative estimation of moisture, thermal and health conditions of vegetation canopy throughout the growing season. The indices were calculated for the entire 1981-2010 period of the AVHRR sensor in space and were compared with regional crop yields in the two dozens of countries. Strong correlation between wheat (both winter and spring), corn, soybeans and sorghum yield and VH indices was found during the critical period of the tested crops. The test results showed that VH indices can be used as proxy for early (2-5 months in advance of harvest) assessment of crop yield with the errors of estimation less than 10%. This paper discusses utility of space observations for early forecasting regional crop yield in Ukraine, with specific emphasis on 2-5 months warning of weather-related losses in agricultural production and their impact on agricultural supply/demand and food security. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",2011,"{""Adamenko, T."",""Kogan, F."",""Kulbida, M.""}",10.1007/978-90-481-9618-0_11,{},included,NA
Integrating Detailed Timber Assortments Into Airborne Laser Scanning (Als)-Based Assessments Of Logging Recoveries,"The methodology presented here can assist in making timber markets more efficient when assessing the value of harvestable timber stands and the amounts of timber assortments during the planning of harvesting operations. Information on wood quality and timber assortments is essential for wood valuation and procurement planning as varying wood dimensions and qualities may be utilized and refined in different places, including sawmills, plywood mills, pulp mills, heating plants or combined heat and power plants. We investigate here alternative approaches for generating detailed timber assortments for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula spp.) from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial images, harvester data and field data. For this purpose, we used 665 circular plots, and logging recovery information recorded from 249 clear-cut stands using cut-to-length harvesters. We estimated timber assortment volumes, economic values and wood paying capabilities (WPC) for each stand in different bucking scenarios, and used the resulting timber assortment estimates to assess logging recoveries. The bucking scenarios were (1) bucking-to-value using maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality (theoretical maximum), and (2) bucking-to-value using sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals for Norway spruce and Scots pine and veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m for birch, either excluding quality (the usual business practice) or including quality (a novel business practice). The results showed that our procedure can assist in locating stands that are likely to be more valuable and have the desired timber assortment distributions. We conclude that the method can estimate WPC with root mean square errors of 28.7\%, 66.0\% and 45.7\% in Norway spruce, Scots pine and birch, respectively, for sawlogs and 19.3\%, 63.7\% and 29.5\% for pulpwood.",NA,NA,10.3390/f12091221,{},included,NA
A Hybrid Kernel-Based Change Detection Method For Remotely Sensed Data In A Similarity Space,"Detection of damages caused by natural disasters is a delicate and difficult task due to the time constraints imposed by emergency situations. Therefore, an automatic Change Detection (CD) algorithm, with less user interaction, is always very interesting and helpful. So far, there is no existing CD approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) multi-temporal images being corrupted by either noise or non-normalized radiometric differences; (c) difference images having overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other. Also, a low degree of automation is not optimal for real-time CD applications and also one-dimensional representations of classical CD methods hide the useful information in multi-temporal images. In order to resolve these problems, two automatic kernel-based CD algorithms (KCD) were proposed based on kernel clustering and support vector data description (SVDD) algorithms in high dimensional Hilbert space. In this paper (a) a new similarity space was proposed in order to increase the separation between change and no-change classes, and also to decrease the processing time, (b) three kernel-based approaches were proposed for transferring the multi-temporal images from spectral space into high dimensional Hilbert space, (c) automatic approach was proposed to extract the precise labeled samples; (d) kernel parameter w a s selected automatically by optimizing an improved cost function and (e) initial value of the kernel parameter was estimated by a statistical method based on the L2-norm distance. Two different datasets including Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were used for the accuracy of analysis of proposed methods. The comparative analysis showed the accuracy improvements of kernel clustering based CD and SVDD based CD methods with respect to the conventional CD techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction, Independent Component Analysis, Spectral Angle Mapper, Simple Image differencing and Image Rationing, and also the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of the proposed CD method in similarity space decreases the processing runtime. © 2015 by the authors.",2015,"{""Homayouni, S."",""Safari, A."",""Shah-Hosseini, R.""}",10.3390/rs71012829,{maybe},included,NA
Determining The Optimal Phenological Stage For Predicting Common Dry Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris) Yield Using Field Spectroscopy,"On-farm crop productivity and yield prediction are valuable for, among others, designing food policies, on-farm and after-farm planning and pricing, and marketing. Whereas existing prediction approaches are generally reliable, these require extensive and tedious field surveys and adequate ancillary agrometeorological data. Remote sensing offers great potential for quick and reliable means of predicting crop yield, but it necessitates establishment of optimal phenological and spectral bands. Given the socio-economic value of common dry bean, we sought to determine the potential of multi-temporal ground-based hyperspectral data to predict yield of three cultivars grown under irrigated and rain-fed regimes. Canopy-level hyperspectral data were collected from the Gadra, Ukulinga and Caledon cultivars at distinct phenological stages and sparse partial least squares regression was used for spectral analysis. Results indicated that variation in yield could be explained at specific growth stages under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. With the exception of the Gadra cultivar under irrigation, models developed with data at the flowering and pod development stage were more accurate. These findings highlight the potential of temporal phenological ground-based hyperspectral data in predicting common dry bean yield under different watering regimes. The findings provide an opportunity for large-scale yield prediction using airborne or space-borne hyperspectral sensors. © 2017 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.",2017,"{""Abdel-Rahman, E."",""Mutanga, O."",""Odindi, J."",""Rajah, P.""}",10.1080/02571862.2017.1317854,{maybe},included,NA
Avhrr Data For Real-Time Operational Flood Forecasting In Malaysia,"Flash floods strike quickly and in most cases without warning. They are usually observed before any warning can be issued and usually persons and property have been affected before the warning reaches them. Such are the conditions prevalent in Malaysia's extreme monsoon weather that occasionally causes floods and results in the extensive damage to property and sometimes loss of lives. Over the years variously hydrological and structural engineering measures have been implemented for flood monitoring and forecasting. These measures have only yielded limited success as may be seen in the recurring flood situation. Yearly financial and property loss estimates have increased and an estimated cost of over 2.5 billion RM is projected for the year 2004 according to sources from the drainage and irrigation department of Malaysia. It has thus become apparent that Malaysia institutes an effective operational flood forecasting to arrest the persisting flood problem. In this paper we will expound on current flood management and forecasting system being implemented in the country, particularly the Klang Valley that includes Kuala Lumpur where there has been tremendous urban growth and development in the last one and half decades. The paper further discusses where current flood management systems have been lacking in the absence of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts. Where as hydrodynamic simulations and structural control measures have been emphasized in many flood management systems in Malaysia, the integration of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts have been conspicuously absent, rendering most in-situ flood forecasts and early warnings ineffective in address the flood problem in the country. Malaysia is a tropical country that lies along the path of the northeast and southwest monsoon. Although satellite image based NWP have proved useful for the tropical and equatorial regions of the world in flood forecasting, they have yet to be applied in Malaysia. Observations have generally shown heavy cumulonimbus clouds formation and thunderstorms precede the usual heavy monsoon rains that cause floods in the region. This makes quantitative precipitation forecast a must be input to any flood early warning design. Numerous empirical studies have determined that cloud top temperatures less that 235k in the tropics are generally expected to produce convective rainfall at the rate of 3mm/hr. In this study we thus investigate monsoon cloud formation that has the propensity to precipitate using NOAA-AVHRR data for real-time operational flood early warning in Malaysia. The AVHRR data has been preferred for its relatively high temporal resolution of at most 6/hours, its easy acquisition and cost effectiveness and its ability for automated geometric rectification when compared to GEOS and GMS data. Cloud cover and types are processed using cloud indexing and pattern recognition techniques on the AVHRR data. The cloud indexing technique was initially developed for NOAA but was later also adapted for Geostationary satellite images. The technique assigns rainfall levels to each cloud type identifies in an image based on the relationship between cold and bright clouds top temperature and the high probability of precipitation. We discuss how visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) techniques are applied to bi-spectral cloud classification and rain areas are determined by classifying pixel clusters in the VIS/IR histogram. Precipitation probability is evaluated based on the relationship between cold and brightness temperature of clouds. The near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) channels 3, 4, and 5 of the data are processed for temperature and brightness. Cold clouds with temperature below 235k threshold value are taken as indication of rain. Rainfall is estimated based on the assumption that every cloud pixel has a constant unit rain-rate of 3mmh-1, which is appropriate for tropical precipitation over 2.5° × 2.5° areas around the equator. The paper finally discusses current developments in nowcasting that utilizes latest satellite observatio s together with numerical weather prediction models and how this system can be adapted to the needs of very short term forecast for flood early warnings in Malaysia. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2005,"{""Billa, L."",""Ghazali, A.

"Estimating District-Level Electricity Consumption Using Remotely Sensed Data In Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand","The intensive industrial development in special economic zones, such as Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, increases energy consumption, leading to an imbalance of energy supply and a challenge for energy management. Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2. The local government in developing countries with limited data and financial resources can adopt the proposed approach to benefit from utilizing commonly available remote sensing and statistical data with simple machine learning models such as DT (regression method) for sustainable electricity management.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs13224654,{},included,NA
"Catching ""Butterflies"" In The Morning: A New Methodology For Rapid Detection Of Aerially Deployed Plastic Land Mines From Uavs","It is estimated that there are at least 100 million military munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) devices in the world of various size, shape, and composition. Millions of these are surface plastic land mines with low-pressure detonation regimes, such as the mass-produced Soviet PFM-1. These aerially deployed land mines are concentrated primarily in postconflict developing countries such as Afghanistan and represent a continued humanitarian threat, while also thwarting economic and social development in impacted regions. Identification of this particular type of MEC category poses a significant geophysical challenge, as these mines contain almost no metal (nonferrous aluminum). As a result, standard MEC detection and remediation methodologies based on geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic induction prove largely ineffective and possibly dangerous. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles can rapidly collect large remotely sensed data sets with no risk to MEC technicians. We present results of an experiment focused on remotely assessing thermal signatures of plastic land mines relative to background geology to show that this type of analysis permits rapid detection of randomly dispersed plastic MECs with a high degree of accuracy and low associated costs. © 2018 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",NA,NA,10.1190/tle37050367.1,{},included,NA
Linking Geomatics And Participatory Social Analysis For Environmental Monitoring: Case Studies From Malawi,"In this paper we demonstrate the need for linking geomatics and social analysis methodologies for enumerating and describing land-use change. Until recently, these two methods were used as distinct approaches at varying levels of inquiry. Using two case studies from Malawi, inductive and deductive approaches to land-use/landcover monitoring illustrate the utility of linking geomatics and social analysis as complementary tools. While both studies integrate geomatics with community-based social analysis, the starting point for each is different. The first case study begins by identifying where environmental change is occurring without preconceived hypotheses of causes. The use of geomatics in this case guides the researchers in determining where to conduct more in-depth analysis of explanations of change. The second case study begins with an environmental policy question - ""What has been the effect of market liberalization on the environment?"" - and then uses remote sensing to evaluate a set of hypotheses. This is the deductive approach. Regardless of the starting point, integrating geomatics and social analysis can promote a cycle of inductive and deductive research. In this way geomatics and social analysis not only address different questions but also can be used to verify and further develop contributions to nature-society dynamics.",NA,NA,10.3138/u52p-1r20-9l57-9373,{maybe},included,NA
Do Big Unstructured Biodiversity Data Mean More Knowledge?,"Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of ""big unstructured data"" for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on ""big data."" Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritize data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs. standardized data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: (1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardized long-termspecies population studies; (2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and (3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.",NA,NA,10.3389/fevo.2018.00239,"{interesting,maybe}",included,NA
Index-Based Insurance For Climate Risk Management And Rural Development In Syria,"Improving the adaptive capacity of rural producers to climate and weather risks may become an urgent issue in the early stages of political stabilization in Syria. Therefore, this study analyses the agro-ecological, economic and social benefits of - and the institutional challenges to - establishing index-based insurance markets to catalyse rural development in Syria. The paper examines the potential of three index insurance schemes for minimizing risk: (1) a statistical index, (2) an index based on agro-meteorological approach and (3) a remote sensing-based index. It also discusses how index-based insurance markets contribute to rural development in scenarios of increasing climate risks. The study identifies that all three insurance schemes have a very high potential to cope with increasing climate risk. Insurance schemes designed according to these indexes performed very well in terms of covering revenue losses in most of the extreme drought years observed in the country. Farmers purchasing an insurance contract may have better access to credit and find it easier to invest in agricultural production and improve productivity. Because such alternative index-based insurance programmes are low cost, they are more affordable for poor farmers and thus can potentially make an excellent contribution to economic growth in rural areas.",NA,NA,10.1080/17565529.2013.844676,{},included,NA
Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Prediction And Satellite Data For Forecasting Us Maize Yield,"Seasonal agricultural production forecasting is essential for agricultural supply chain and economic prediction. However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble. (3) Using the ""T + P + VPD + EVI"" model with climate prediction from bias-corrected climate prediction from CFSv2 outperformed the yield forecast in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates reports released by the United States Department of Agriculture, with root-mean-square error of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79\% of multiyear averaged yield) by early August. Plain Language Summary Given the significant advances in both seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing, these data have not been fully used in crop yield forecasting at regional scale, and their benefits are to be quantified compared to survey-based approaches. Here we evaluated the benefits of using seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing data in forecasting U.S. maize yield at both national and county levels. To achieve this goal, we built a seasonal forecasting system for U.S. maize yield by bridging the most advanced seasonal climate prediction products from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) with a statistical crop modeling framework. We found we could not achieve a better forecasting performance than the official survey-based forecast from United States Department of Agriculture until we used both climate and remote sensing observations in our model. Compared with using historical climate information for the unknown future in each growing season, using climate prediction from NCEP gave better forecasting performance once we corrected the bias in the seasonal climate prediction products. Using our climate-remote sensing combined model and bias-corrected climate prediction from NCEP, we achieved a better forecasting performance than the United States Department of Agriculture forecast. Our system will be useful for the stakeholders in the agriculture industry and commodity market.",NA,NA,10.1029/2018gl079291,{},included,NA
A Land Use Regression Model Incorporating Data On Industrial Point Source Pollution,"Advancing the understanding of the spatial aspects of air pollution in the city regional environment is an area where improved methods can be of great benefit to exposure assessment and policy support. We created land use regression (LUR) models for SO2, NO2 and PM10 for Tianjin, China. Traffic volumes, road networks, land use data, population density, meteorological conditions, physical conditions and satellite-derived greenness, brightness and wetness were used for predicting SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. We incorporated data on industrial point sources to improve LUR model performance. In order to consider the impact of different sources, we calculated the PSIndex, LSIndex and area of different land use types (agricultural land, industrial land, commercial land, residential land, green space and water area) within different buffer radii (1 to 20 km). This method makes up for the lack of consideration of source impact based on the LUR model. Remote sensing-derived variables were significantly correlated with gaseous pollutant concentrations such as SO2 and NO2. R-2 values of the multiple linear regression equations for SO2, NO2 and PM10 were 0.78, 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, and the RMSE values were 0.32, 0.18 and 0.21, respectively. Model predictions at validation monitoring sites went well with predictions generally within 15\% of measured values. Compared to the relationship between dependent variables and simple variables (such as traffic variables or meteorological condition variables), the relationship between dependent variables and integrated variables was more consistent with a linear relationship. Such integration has a discernable influence on both the overall model prediction and health effects assessment on the spatial distribution of air pollution in the city region.",NA,NA,10.1016/s1001-0742(11)60902-9,{maybe},included,NA
Small Drones For Community-Based Forest Monitoring: An Assessment Of Their Feasibility And Potential In Tropical Areas,"Data gathered through community-based forest monitoring (CBFM) programs may be as accurate as those gathered by professional scientists, but acquired at a much lower cost and capable of providing more detailed data about the occurrence, extent and drivers of forest loss, degradation and regrowth at the community scale. In addition, CBFM enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore, CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations, governments and forest data end-users, particularly those engaged in forestry, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation projects such as REDD+.",2014,"{""Koh, Lian Pin"",""McCall, Michael K."",""Napoletano, Brian M."",""Paneque-Galvez, Jaime"",""Wich, Serge A.""}",10.3390/f5061481,{},included,NA
Costs And Benefits Of Satellite-Based Tools For Irrigation Management,"This paper presents the results of a collaborative work with farmers and a cost-benefit analysis of geospatial technologies applied to irrigation water management in a semi-arid agricultural area in Lower Austria. We use Earth observation (Eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (Et) and webGlS technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers. The study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments. The calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers. In most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops. At the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types. Our data clearly indicates that economic benefits could be achieved by reducing irrigation volumes, especially for water-intensive crops. Regarding the qualitative evaluation, most of the farmers expressed a very positive interest in the provided information. In particular, information related to crop ET was appreciated as this helps to make better informed decisions on irrigation. The majority of farmers (54\%) also expressed a general willingness to pay, either directly or via cost sharing, for such a service. Based on different cost scenarios, we calculated the cost of the service. Considering 20,000 ha regularly irrigated land, the advisory service would cost between 2.5 and 4.3 (sic)/ha per year depending on the type of satellite data used. For comparison, irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 /ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters per ha. With a correct irrigation application, more than 10\% of the water and energy could be saved in water-intensive crops, which is equivalent to an economic benefit of 40-100 (sic)/ha per year.",NA,NA,10.3389/fenvs.2015.00052,{},included,NA
Ndvi Identification And Survey Of A Roman Road In The Northern Spanish Province Of Alava,"The Iter 34 (Antonine Itinerary XXXIV) is the name of the Roman road that crosses the province of alava from west to east. Since no specific path was officially recognized before our study, the remains of the road did not benefit from heritage protection. In 2017, we made a project to determine the course of the road through rural alava. In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying. By using precision farming techniques we have identified the course of the Roman road Iter 34 in several locations in a short period of time and with few resources.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11060725,{},included,NA
Integrating Field And Satellite Data For Spatially Explicit Inference On The Density Of Threatened Arboreal Primates,"Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.",NA,NA,10.1002/eap.1438,{},included,NA
Image To Attribute Model For Trees (Itam-T): Individual Tree Detection And Classification In Alberta Boreal Forest For Wildland Fire Fuel Characterization,"Regional and municipal decision makers rely on fuel (vegetation) maps to inform decisions on tree stand management related to wildfire management and response. Remote sensing of trees is used in commercial applications but has limited uptake in the fire management community. A two-stage detection and identification convolutional network for high-resolution RGB drone imagery is developed to address this limitation. The detection routine is based on DeepForest, an existing convolutional neural network implementation designed to recognize trees in aerial imagery. Retraining the model and implementing an adaptive window-size workflow improves tree detection, with F-1 scores reaching 85\% and averaging 72\% for k-fold cross-validation in boreal forest. For classification, a VGG19 network with added data augmentation and dropout layers is trained. When this network is implemented, manually annotated trees are recognized as coniferous with an average F-1 of 97\% and deciduous with an 87\% F-1. Overall, the developed image-to-attribute model for trees reaches a maximum F-1 score of 85\% considering classification after identification, with averages of 72\% for coniferous trees and 57\% for deciduous trees over six sites. Tree height, size, and stem density are extracted from the tree location output and geometric data. The calculated density is compared to the density of manual annotations, with an average R-2 of 0.90. A remote preliminary proximity-based hazard assessment is performed on a rural property in Alberta, demonstrating the model's ability to detect and classify trees near values-at-risk. The results indicate a potential extension to low-cost decision support in enterprise and fire-related applications.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2022.2048914,"{maybe,""probaly not"",validation}",included,NA
"Societal Need For Improved Understanding Of Climate Change, Anthropogenic Impacts, And Geo-Hazard Warning Drive Development Of Ocean Observatories In European Seas","Society's needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Emergent Challenges For Science Suas Data Management: Fairness Through Community Engagement And Best Practices Development,"The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as platforms for data capture has rapidly increased in recent years. However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data-as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases-is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting-as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases-novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11151797,{},included,NA
Fuel Modelling Characterisation Using Low-Density Lidar In The Mediterranean: An Application To A Natural Protected Area,"Fuel structure and characteristics are important to better understand and predict wildfire behaviour. The aim of the present study was to develop a methodology for characterising fuel models using low-density and free LiDAR data that facilitate the work of managers of protected territories. Field inventories were carried out in order to understand the characteristics of the stand and the variables that fuel models must include. This information, together with the use of the intensity and structure provided by LiDAR, was used to perform statistical analyses. The linear regressions obtained to characterise the stand of the mixed Quercus spp.-Pinus ssp.-dominated stand had an R-2 value ranging from 0.4393 to 0.66. While working with low-density LiDAR data (which has more difficulties crossing the canopy), in addition to the obtained results, we performed the statistical analysis of the dominant stand to obtain models with R-2 values ranging from 0.8201 to 0.8677. The results of this research show that low-density LiDAR data are significant; however, in mixed stands, it is necessary to only use the dominant stratum because other components generate noise, which reduces the predictive capacity of the models. Additionally, by using the decision tree developed in combination, it is possible to update the mapping of fuel models in inaccessible areas, thereby significantly reducing costs.",NA,NA,10.3390/f12081011,{},included,NA
Cloud Cover And Its Impact On Brazil's Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Program: Evidence From The Cerrado Biome Of The Brazilian Legal Amazon,"The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7\% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US\$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102651,{},included,NA
Enabling Efficient Service Function Chains At Terrestrial-Satellite Hybrid Cloud Networks,"The great improvements in both satellite and terrestrial networks have motivated the academic and industrial communities to rethink their integration. As a result, there is an increasing interest in new-generation hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks, where sufficient flexibility should be enabled to deploy customized SFCs to satisfy the growing diversity of user needs. However, it is still challenging to achieve such a nice vision, since many key issues remain unaddressed comprehensively such as framework design, communication procedures and resource optimization. Therefore, in this article, we focus on how to efficiently deploy customized SFCs at terrestrial-satellite hybrid cloud networks. In particular, we first propose an elastic framework used for SFC deployment at clouds, and second propose an efficient SFC mapping approach for improvement of system resource utilization. Finally, we verify the proposed framework at a proof-of-concept prototype via a number of use cases, and evaluate the proposed mapping approach through extensive simulations based on a real-world topology. Related experimental and simulation results have confirmed the feasibility and benefits of our proposed framework and mapping approach. © 2019 IEEE",NA,NA,10.1109/mnet.2019.1800426,{},included,NA

Landscape Disturbance Gradients: The Importance Of The Type Of Scene When Evaluating Landscape Preferences And Perceptions,"Understanding of people's landscape preferences is important for decision-making about land planning, particularly in the disturbance patterns that usually occur in rural-urban gradients. However, the use of different types of images concerning the same landscape may influence social preferences and thus perceptions of landscape management and planning decisions. We evaluated landscape preferences and perceptions in four landscapes of southern Chile. We specifically: (1) compared people's perceptions related to living in, visiting, the scenic beauty, well-being, risks, and level of landscape disturbance; and (2) evaluated the influence of the type of scene (i.e., eye-level or aerial images) in these preferences and perceptions. Preferences and perceptions resulted to be better when using eye-level (4.0 +/- 1.1) than aerial (3.7 +/- 0.6) images. In general, we observed a negative association between preferences and perceptions and the landscape disturbance; however, it was consistent when using aerial images but was masked when valuing landscape through eye-level images. Implications of these results are relevant because by far, most landscape preference studies use traditional eye-level images. Different types of scenes should be considered in order to embrace the landscape preferences and perceptions of all those involved and help decision-making in landscape planning.",NA,NA,10.3390/land9090306,"{""prefs and perception"",""sense of place""}",included,NA
"Monitoring Soil-Plant Interactions And Maize Yield By Satellite Vegetation Indexes, Soil Electrical Conductivity And Management Zones","In modern agriculture, understanding the spatio-temporal variability in crop fields and the implications of environmental factors in soil management are important for sustainable practices. In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield. Finally, the MZs derived from spectral data could define yield-limiting zones inside the crop field.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11119-023-09994-8,{},included,NA
Satellite Imagery As A Single Source Of Predictor Variables For Habitat Suitability Modelling: How Landsat Can Inform The Conservation Of A Critically Endangered Lemur,"1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain. © 2010 The Authors.

Forest Fire Risk Zone Mapping Of Eravikulam National Park In India: A Comparison Between Frequency Ratio And Analytic Hierarchy Process Methods,"Forest fire is one of the most common natural hazards occurring in the Western Ghats region of Kerala and is one of the reasons for forest degradation. This natural disaster causes considerable damage to the biodiversity of this region during the dry fire season. The area selected for the present study, Eravikulam National Park, which is predominantly of grassland vegetation, is also prone to forest fires. This study aims to delineate the forest fire risk zones in Eravikulam National Park using remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. In the present study, methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) were used to derive the weights, and the results were compared. We have used seven factors, i.e. land cover types, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, slope angle, slope aspect, distance from the settlement, and distance from the road to prepare the fire risk zone map. The area of the prepared risk zone maps is divided into three zones, namely low, moderate, and high. From the study, it was found that the fire occurring in this area is due to natural as well as anthropogenic factors. The prepared forest fire risk zone maps are validated using the fire incidence data for the period from January 2003 to June 2019 collected from the records of the Forest Survey of India. The investigation revealed that 72\% and 24\% of the fire incidences occurred in the high risk zone of the maps prepared using the AHP and FR methods, respectively, which ascertained the superiority of the AHP method over the FR method for forest fire risk zone mapping. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis gives an area under the ROC curve (ALIC) value of 0.767 and 0.567 for the AHP and FR methods, respectively. The risk zone maps will be useful for staff of the forest department, planners, and officials of the disaster management department to take effective preventive and mitigation measures.",2022,"{""Ajin, R.

Flood Risk Analysis: The Case Of Tigris River (Tikrit /Iraq),"The study of flood risks has a fundamental role in ensuring the safety of cities near rivers and drawing up plans to protect them during future floods. This study aims to manage potential flood risks, and Tikrit city was used as a case study. The daily discharge of the Tigris River in the study area was provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources from 2019 to 2022. The HEC-RAS software was utilized to build a 2-D flood model to simulate potential flood scenarios. First, the model was calibrated by adjusting the value of Manning's coefficient (n), and it was found that n = 0.031 reflects the nature of the region because the Nash-Sutcliff Error (NSE) was 0.93. Then, the efficiency of the 2-D flood model was verified by comparing the model’s results with the study area’s satellite images, and the results showed a great match. Following that, the 2-D model was used under different flooding scenarios. The results showed that the size of areas exposed to flooding increased with the discharges passing through the Tigris River. For instance, increasing the discharge to 800m3/s increased the flooded areas by 13.7%, while increasing the discharge to 1500 m3/s increased the flooded areas by 90.7 % compared to the river’s normal flow. Also, the results showed that the eastern regions of the riverbanks are more vulnerable to flooding than the western side because the ground levels are low on the eastern side compared to the western part of the riverbanks. © 2023 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, TIKRIT UNIVERSITY.",2023,"{""Khairallah, R.

Evaluating Performance Of Community-Based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-Sensing Technologies To Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management,"An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77\% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50\% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.",NA,NA,10.1007/s41101-023-00222-y,{},included,NA
"The Use Of Innovative Techniques For Management Of High-Risk Coastal Areas, Mitigation Of Earthquake-Triggered Landslide Risk And Responsible Coastal Development","Coastal areas constitute a very dynamic environment, balancing between numerous natural and anthropogenic processes liable to sometimes hazardous geomorphic phenomena. Especially in tectonically active coastal regions and areas of high economic value, slope failures can have significant impacts and therefore need careful and detailed examination. This work uses Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-aided photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) in tectonically active segments of the coastal zone of the Ionian Islands in Greece, to explore how their capabilities can help to improve our understanding of the structural integrity of the slopes. Results show that the two approaches are able to extract large numbers of discontinuity facets, in a more practical, rapid and safe way than conventional methods of rock slope stability analysis extending to unreachable yet important parts of the slope. Through this holistic record of the structural condition of the slope the two applications allow the identification of segments that are more prone to instability and failure. In this way, they improve our understanding of the prioritization of interventions aiming to enhance the prevention of slope failures, mitigating the associated risk and improving local development in these high-value locations.",NA,NA,10.3390/app12042193,{},included,NA

Rapid Estimation Of Canopy Nitrogen Of Cereal Crops At Paddock Scale Using A Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index,"Rising nitrogen (N) fertiliser costs and concerns over environmental impacts have emphasized the need for rapid, non-destructive, paddock-scale tools to support optimal management of N fertiliser in cereal crops. Remote sensing of canopy reflectance is one approach to address the information needed to guide N applications. One remote sensing vegetation index, the Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was developed to address issues of confounding effects of biomass and chlorophyll concentration, and Fitzgerald et al. (2010) linked the CCCI to the Canopy Nitrogen Index (CNI), a scaled index of the plant N. In the research presented here, we extend the work by Fitzgerald et al. (2010) and Cammarano et al. (2011) to whole paddocks with ground-based, airborne and satellite imagery. The methodology was applied to 11 datasets using multispectral cameras deployed on ground-based and airborne platforms, and to satellite imagery. The previously published relationship between CNI and CCCI was applied to the CCCI and biomass measurements from these new datasets to estimate CNI. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.70. A regression using the means from each dataset produced an r(2) of 0.60, and a standard error of 0.82 (\%N). Exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.87 and reduced the standard error to 0.45 (\%N). A crop model (APSIM v7) was used to simulate above ground dry matter to substitute for measured biomass, and plant N was determined from the measured CCCI and simulated biomass. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.49. The regression using the averages from each dataset was not significant (F-pr >0.10); however, exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.89 and reduced the standard error to 0.42 (\%N). To demonstrate the utility of the methods, simulated biomass values coupled with CNI estimated from RapidEye imagery were used to generate paddock maps of plant N. While the agreement between measured and estimated plant N at the paddock scales is not as close as the previous work done at small plot scales, the method shows promise, particularly if biomass can be estimated through modeling or non-destructive measures.

Mesoscale Convective Systems Monitoring On The Basis Of Msg Data - Case Studies,"Analysis described in the paper were made in the frame of the PROZA (Operational decision-making based on atmospheric conditions, http://projekt-proza.pl/) project co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. One of its tasks was to develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena, which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model) forecasts.

Integration Of Lidar And Pleiades Data In Identifying The Potential Of Hazardous Trees,"Trees beautify the landscape and provide numerous benefits for human well-being. Without proper maintenance and mitigating, the hazardous trees with structural defects can be harmful to the local community. In practice, the hazardous trees can be assessed using visual tree assessment (VTA), expertise interview and questionnaire. The advancement in remote sensing technology provides users with alternative ways to identify the hazardous trees and is very efficient especially in large areas. The intent of this study is to identify the potential of the tree hazard in UiTM Shah Alam from the integration of LiDAR and Pleiades dataset. Tree health condition and tree height were derived from LiDAR and Pleiades dataset. Height of trees were extracted from a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and the condition of tree health were assessed based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Both parameters were used to classify the individual into low, moderate and high-risk ratings. The findings demonstrated that the integration of both datasets successfully identified the potential of tree hazard at the study area. Altogether 108 of individual trees were detected. 7 and 67 trees were identified as high and moderate risk respectively.

Machine Learning As A Strategic Tool For Helping Cocoa Farmers In Cote D'ivoire,"Machine learning can be used for social good. The employment of artificial intelligence in smart agriculture has many benefits for the environment: it helps small farmers (at a local scale) and policymakers and cooperatives (at regional scale) to take valid and coordinated countermeasures to combat climate change. This article discusses how artificial intelligence in agriculture can help to reduce costs, especially in developing countries such as Cote d'Ivoire, employing only low-cost or open-source tools, from hardware to software and open data. We developed machine learning models for two tasks: the first is improving agricultural farming cultivation, and the second is water management. For the first task, we used deep neural networks (YOLOv5m) to detect healthy plants and pods of cocoa and damaged ones only using mobile phone images. The results confirm it is possible to distinguish well the healthy from damaged ones. For actions at a larger scale, the second task proposes the analysis of remote sensors, coming from the GRACE NASA Mission and ERA5, produced by the Copernicus climate change service.

Landscape Design As A Tool To Reduce Soil Salinization: The Study Case Of Keriya Oasis (Nw China),"Irrational use and management of water and land are associated with poor hydro-geological conditions causing water logging and salinization problems, possibly leading to farmland abandonment and economic loss. This poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis' and requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage, natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally. It is worth mentioning that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil. Natural drainage (the depth and width are 4-10 m and 50-100 m, respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some salinized villages in the range of 3000-5000 m and ancient groundwater drainage systems, such as Karez are supporting the oasis with drainage water for centuries. In addition landscape characteristics, salinization and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from Landsat image, DEM, literature and field photos. Then based on the gathered information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape. Then according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization approaches were recommended for different landscapes. To address environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was validated by stakeholder opinion. The results provide guidelines for sustainable desalinization design and highlight the importance of combining traditional knowledge and modern ecological principles in sustainable landscape design.",2019,"{""Abliz, Abdugheni"",""Lv, Guang-Hui"",""Seydehmet, Jumeniyaz""}",10.3390/su11092578,"{""stakeholder opinion"",maybe}",included,NA
Lessons Learned From Participatory Land Use Planning With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images In Tanzania: Practitioners' And Participants' Perspectives,"Participatory mapping (PM) solutions have become common in many sectors of society to enhance engagement of the local communities in planning processes. Especially in data scarce regions, like Africa, PM that captures local knowledge in spatially explicit form is an important tool for integrating previously non-existent spatial knowledge in to collaborative planning. Despite the increasing usage of PM solutions, there still lies a gap in our knowledge of the influence and enabling factors of PM adoption in real-world decision-making processes. We studied practitioners' and participants' perceptions on benefits and limitations of PM that uses high-resolution remote sensing imagery to engage with participants in six use cases in Tanzania. We conducted interviews and one group discussion with practitioners, and feedback surveys among PM participants. According to the experiences of the practitioners and participants, PM methods based on high-resolution remote sensing images have increased practitioners' work quality and professional competence, and enhanced participants' active participation and spatial understanding for informed decision-making. Technical challenges and lack of skilled experts and institutional support were commonly identified limitations. Based on the users' perceptions we identified previously recognized enabling factors such as supportive policy environment but also context specific factors; removal of disincentives and wider awareness raising. Moreover, advocacy among policymakers on the benefits of participatory decision-making and geospatial technologies is needed to build their ownership of the new governance practices.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105649,{},included,NA
Multi-Decadal Assessment Of Soil Loss In A Mediterranean Region Characterized By Contrasting Local Climates,"Soil erosion is one of the most widespread soil degradation phenomena worldwide. Mediterranean landscapes, due to some peculiar characteristics, such as fragility of soils, steep slopes, and rainfall distribution during the year, are particularly subject to this phenomenon, with severe and complex issues for agricultural production and biodiversity protection. In this paper, we present a diachronic approach to the analysis of soil loss, which aims to account for climate variability and land cover dynamics by using remote data about rainfall and land cover to guarantee sufficient observational continuity. The study area (Basilicata, Southern Italy) is characterized by different local climates and ecosystems (temperate, Csa and Csb; arid steppic, Bsk; and cold, Dsb and Dsc), and is particularly suited to represent the biogeographical complexity of the Mediterranean Italy. The well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was applied by integrating information from remote sensing to carry out decadal assessments (1994, 2004, 2014, and 2021) of the annual soil loss. Changes in the rainfall regime and vegetation cover activity were derived from CHIRPS and Landsat data, respectively, to obtain updated information useful for dynamical studies. For the analyzed region, soil loss shows a slight reduction (albeit always remarkable) over the whole period, and distinct spatial patterns between lowland Bsk and Mediterranean mountain Dsb and Dsc climate areas. The most alarming fact is that most of the study area showed soil erosion rates in 2021 greater than 11 t/ha{*}y, which is considered by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) the threshold for identifying severe erosion phenomena. A final comparison with local studies shows, on average, differences of about 5 t ha(-1) y(-1) (minimum 2.5 and maximum 7) with respect to the local estimates obtained with the RUSLE model. The assessment at a regional scale provided an average 9.5\% of soil loss difference for the arable lands and about 10\% for all cultivated areas. The spatial-temporal patterns enhance the relevance of using the cover management factor C derived from satellite data rather than land cover maps, as remote observations are able to highlight the heterogeneity in vegetation density within the same vegetation cover class, which is particularly relevant for agricultural areas. For mountain areas, the adoption of a satellite-gridded rainfall dataset allowed the detection of erosion rate fluctuations due to rainfall variability, also in the case of sparse or absent ground pluviometric stations. The use of remote data represents a precious added value to obtain a dynamic picture of the spatial-temporal variability of soil loss and new insights into the sustainability of soil use in a region whose economy is mostly based on agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources.",2022,"{""Coluzzi, Rosa"",""Imbrenda, Vito"",""Lanfredi, Maria"",""Pace, Letizia"",""Samela, Caterina"",""Simoniello, Tiziana""}",10.3390/land11071010,"{""probably not""}",included,NA
Remotely Sensed Vegetation Productivity Predicts Breeding Activity And Drought Refuges For A Threatened Bird In Semi-Arid Australia,"Refuges play a critical role protecting species against the effects of climate change. Managing high priority refuges could improve species resilience and facilitate dispersal during periods of environmental change. In this study, we identified drought refuges in semi-arid Australia for a threatened bird, the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. Using a Poisson regression model, we quantified the effect of remotely sensed vegetation indices, rainfall, soil moisture and site characteristics on malleefowl breeding activity at 144 sites surveyed from 2000 to 2017 during and after drought. We tested the effect of two vegetation productivity indices on malleefowl breeding activity - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - averaged across three temporal and three spatial scales during the mound building and incubation stage of the breeding cycle. We found that NDVI and EVI were better predictors of malleefowl breeding activity than soil moisture and winter rainfall. The model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value contained NDVI averaged over 3 months (June-August) and a 1-km radius. Malleefowl breeding activity had a strong positive association with NDVI (0.42 +/- se 0.03) and a negative association with slope (-0.34 +/- se 0.03) and vegetation patch size (-0.23 +/- se 0.02). We found the proportion of refugia (top 20\% of predicted breeding activity) in protected areas was highly variable, decreasing from 42\% in an extreme wet year (2011) to 14\% in an extreme drought year (2007). Expanding the reserve network to include refugia predicted to occur in the south of semi-arid Victoria could improve resilience of malleefowl to climate change. We demonstrate how remotely sensed vegetation indices combined with citizen science data can identify where to protect native vegetation with high, stable productivity. Our approach could be applied to a broad range of species in semi-arid regions vulnerable to climate change.",NA,NA,10.1111/acv.12763,{},included,NA
Neutrosophic Game Pricing Methods With Risk Aversion For Pricing Of Data Products,"With the progressive development of satellite image data products, their pricing strategies become more and more important for enterprises to earn profits. The objective of this study is to explore several game pricing methods with risk aversion for pricing of data products in neutrosophic environments. First, to reflect the uncertainty of problem parameters, the idea of neutrosophic variables is adopted. With the aid of neutrosophic variables, the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees of players can be intuitively and conveniently obtained. Subsequently, considering the risk aversion of decision makers, the optimistic value theory is introduced into neutrosophic variables for calculating the optimistic value of player's profits. Then, different pricing models are constructed under the Bertrand and Stackelberg game scenarios, respectively. After deriving the corresponding equilibrium equations, some numerical instances are provided to testify the feasibility of our methods. Furthermore, the influences of dissimilar market power structures are examined. Finally, the effects of seven problem parameters and players' confidence levels on pricing results are investigated through sensitivity analyses. The results show that the proposed methods are practicable and can offer guidance for the pricing decision of data products.",NA,NA,10.1111/exsy.12697,"{""societal context?""}",included,NA
An Evaluation Of The Use Of Remotely Sensed Parameters For Prediction Of Incidence And Risk Associated With Vibrio Parahaemolyticus In Gulf Coast Oysters (Crassostrea Virginica),"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently published a Vibrio parahaemol.y'ticus risk assessment for consumption of raw oysters that predicts V. parahaemolyticus densities at harvest based on water temperature. We retrospectively compared archived remotely sensed measurements (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity) with previously published data from an environmental study of V. parahaemolyticus in Alabama oysters to assess the utility of the former data for predicting V. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters. Remotely sensed sea surface temperature correlated well with previous in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.86) of bottom water temperature, supporting the notion that remotely sensed sea surface temperature data are a sufficiently accurate substitute for direct measurement. Turbidity and chlorophyll levels were not determined in the previous study, but in comparison with the V. parahaemolyticus data, remotely sensed values for these parameters may explain some of the variation in V. parahaemolyticus levels. More accurate determination of these effects and the temporal and spatial variability of these parameters may further improve the accuracy of prediction models. To illustrate the utility of remotely sensed data as a basis for risk management, predictions based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration V. parahaemolyticus risk assessment model were integrated with remotely sensed sea surface temperature data to display graphically variations in V. parahaemolyticus density in oysters associated with spatial variations in water temperature. We believe images such as these could be posted in near real time, and that the availability of such information in a user-friendly format could be the basis for timely and informed risk management decisions.",2007,"{""Bowers, J."",""DePaola, A."",""Grimes, D.

Predicting Breeding Habitat For Amphibians: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Across Yellowstone National Park,"The ability to predict amphibian breeding across landscapes is important for informing land management decisions and helping biologists better understand and remediate factors contributing to declines in amphibian populations. We built geospatial models of likely breeding habitats for each of four amphibian species that breed in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We used field data collected in 2000-2002 from 497 sites among 16 basins and predictor variables from geospatial models produced from remotely sensed data (e. g., digital elevation model, complex topographic index, landform data, wetland probability, and vegetative cover). Except for 31 sites in one basin that were surveyed in both 2000 and 2002, all sites were surveyed once. We used polytomous regression to build statistical models for each species of amphibian from (1) field survey site data only, (2) field data combined with data from geospatial models, and (3) data from geospatial models only. Based on measures of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores, models of the second type best explained likely breeding habitat because they contained the most information (ROC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88). However, models of the third type could be applied to the entire YNP landscape and produced maps that could be verified with reserve field data. Accuracy rates for models built for single years were highly variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.78. Accuracy rates for models built with data combined from multiple years were higher and less variable, ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Combining results from the geospatial multiyear models yielded maps of ""core"" breeding areas (areas with high probability values for all three years) surrounded by areas that scored high for only one or two years, providing an estimate of variability among years. Such information can highlight landscape options for amphibian conservation. For example, our models identify alternative areas that could be protected for each species, including 6828-10 764 ha for tiger salamanders, 971-3017 ha for western toads, 4732-16 696 ha for boreal chorus frogs, and 4940-19 690 ha for Columbia spotted frogs.",NA,NA,10.1890/10-1261.1,{},included,NA
Crop Dominance Mapping With Irs-P6 And Modis 250-M Time Series Data,"This paper describes an approach to accurately separate out and quantify crop dominance areas in the major command area in the Krishna River Basin. Classification was performed using IRS-P6 (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, series P6) and MODIS eight-day time series remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 23.6 m, 250 m for the year 2005. Temporal variations in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) pattern obtained in crop dominance classes enables a demarcation between long duration crops and short duration crops. The NDVI pattern was found to be more consistent in long duration crops than in short duration crops due to the continuity of the water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release, which affected the time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was, in turn, reflected in the NDVI pattern. The identified crop-wise classes were tested and verified using ground-truth data and state-level census data. The accuracy assessment was performed based on ground-truth data through the error matrix method, with accuracies from 67\% to 100\% for individual crop dominance classes, with an overall accuracy of 79\% for all classes. The derived major crop land areas were highly correlated with the sub-national statistics with R-2 values of 87\% at the mandal (sub-district) level for 2005-2006. These results suggest that the methods, approaches, algorithms and datasets used in this study are ideal for rapid, accurate and large-scale mapping of paddy rice, as well as for generating their statistics over large areas. This study demonstrates that IRS-P6 23.6-m one-time data fusion with MODIS 250-m time series data is very useful for identifying crop type, the source of irrigation water and, in the case of surface water irrigation, the way in which it is applied. The results from this study have assisted in improving surface water and groundwater irrigated areas of the command area and also provide the basis for better water resource assessments at the basin scale.",NA,NA,10.3390/agriculture4020113,{},included,NA
Advanced Warning Method For Aircraft Landing Risk Under Air –Ground Data Real-Time Transmission Conditions,"At present, the flight safety work of civil aviation in China mainly investigates the probable causes of accidents and analyzes flight data after air accidents, causing numerous problems such as passive safety management and delayed risk control. To realize the early warning of flight risk during flight, a dynamic method for the evaluation of landing risk and early warning under the condition of future air –ground data real-time transmission was proposed. The landing stage, which has the most complex operation program and the highest accident rate during a flight, was taken as the research object, and future air-to-ground high-throughput interconnection scenarios comprising 5G and satellite networks were considered to solve the problem of advanced intelligent warnings and aircraft alarms in abnormal flights. First, according to the accident causation theory, the human factor reliability model, the system model, and other theories or models, a landing warning index system based on multisource real-time operation data and the integration of historical statistics and expert knowledge was established. Then, a grounding parameter prediction model was established to solve the problem of lag in the acquisition of four grounding parameters, namely ground pitch angle, ground speed, ground vertical rate, and 50 ft-ground horizontal flight distance in actual flight. This model classified the pilot’s landing operation mode by clustering ARJ21 historical landing data and determined the attribute mean value of the four parameters for each type of operation mode. Furthermore, according to decision field theory, the model discussed the landing mode selection of pilots with different personalities in different scenarios and calculated the selection probability of the pilot’s landing operation mode, thereby obtaining the predicted values of the four above-mentioned indicators. According to the above, aiming at the complexity and uncertainty of the landing risk early warning system, a reasoning method of the multilayer confidence rule base was proposed. This method improved the traditional reasoning method of the single-layer confidence rule base and adopted the bottom-up hierarchical reasoning method considering the complexity characteristics of the landing process, effectively integrating different sources and forms of qualitative or quantitative data. Thus, the dynamic assessment and reasoning of the landing risk were realized. Finally, using the reasoning-based calculation of the landing process for the “2020.10.16 Panzhihua runway grounding event” and “2010.8.2 Yichun air disaster,” the results verified the effectiveness of the method. It was found that the early warning time of the Panzhihua event can reach 13 s. © 2023 Science Press.

A Comprehensive Survey On Gnss Interferences And The Application Of Neural Networks For Anti-Jamming,"In recent years, modern systems are highly reliant on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as reliable positioning, navigation, and timing services have become crucial in many safety-critical, security, and emergency applications. Although GNSS technology offers precise and global positioning and navigation, the GNSS signals are susceptible to intentional and unintentional Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) as the signal strength is weak when they reach the receiver. Hence, the receiver's performance gets degraded as the interference signal may cause navigation error or saturate the receiver's operation. Therefore, the research on interference mitigation is of high interest to the GNSS community and is emerging rapidly. In order to have a beneficial and extensive outlook, an in-depth survey on GNSS interferences and the application of metaheuristic based neural networks for interference cancellation has been presented in this paper; with an emphasis on one of the major GNSS threats i.e. jamming. Various solutions adopted by the researchers to cope up with the interference have been surveyed and presented. Also, to have a more intuitive insight, a comparative analysis of the existing mitigating techniques has been summarized. In addition, the review focuses on the neural network approach for anti-jamming and also discusses the implementation strategy of particle swarm optimization based back propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN) to address the shortcomings of traditional training algorithms. Finally, the future aspects to further enhance the neural network algorithms for anti-jamming have also been provided for the benefit of researchers.",2023,"{""Lorraine, Kambham Jacob Silva"",""Ramarakula, Madhu""}",10.1080/03772063.2021.1953407,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context""}"
"Development Of A Water Quality Management Model For Dry Rivers In Arid Regions: Application On Wadi Rumah, Saudi Arabia","In dry rivers, urban wastewater discharge forms a pond in the dry period, and surface runoff shapes a longer pond in the wet period. A water quality management model developed for dry rivers is applied on Wadi Rumah in Saudi Arabia. The sub-basin was delineated from 30-m x 30-m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Hydrologic loss, runoff rates, and time of concentration were determined using the soil conservation service curve number, soil conservation service unit hydrograph methods, and Kirpich formula. Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System estimated the wet weather flows for 10 low-to-medium rainfall events. A steady-state hydrodynamic model including river flows, effluent discharge, and evaporation and infiltration losses estimated the hydraulic retention time for the explicit case of ponding conditions of dry rivers. Mass balance and first-order kinetics modeled the physical (total dissolved solid and total suspended solid), chemical (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, NH3, PO4, and Cl2), and microbiological (total coliform and fecal coliform) parameters. The hydrodynamic model and biokinetic rate coefficients were calibrated with satellite images, reported literature, and field measurements. A water quality index compared the aggregated water quality against the standards for 4 intended uses. The study yields ""very good"" water quality for restricted and unrestricted irrigation for the dry period, ""fair"" for livestock drinking, and ""marginal"" for fishery and recreation for the dry period, while water quality remained ""marginal"" for all the uses in the wet period. Water quality management implies regular water quality monitoring, continuous improvement of treatment facilities, and flood plain management initiatives for the long-term sustainability of dry rivers in arid regions.",NA,NA,10.34133/ehs.0001,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Spatial Distribution Of Xco2 Using Oco-2 Data In Growing Seasons,"The purpose of this research is to assess the spatial distribution of CO2 concentration during the growing seasons (April to September) in 2015 over Iran. The XCO2 data belonging to orbiting carbon observatory-2 (OCO-2) and eight environmental variables data consist of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), net primary productivity (NPP), land surface temperature (LST), leaf area index (LAI), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and national land cover map were modeled by multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The values of R2 and RMSE indices show the good performance of the multi-layer perceptron model for monthly models. Based on sensitivity analysis results, land cover and wind direction had the most important role in the spatial distribution of XCO2. Also, the results revealed that the maximum values of XCO2 observed in the east, south east, and desert areas in central of Iran due to the lack of vegetation cover, lack of local wind current, and high temperature. The western, northwestern and northern regions of Iran have the minimum amounts of XCO2 because of existing valuable ecosystem such as Hyrcanian and Zagrous forests, rangeland, air currents, and low temperature. The findings of this study indicated that the manageable factors such as land cover and vegetation cover play very important roles in the spatial distribution of CO2 and finding carbon dioxide source and sink at national scale. Therefore, policymakers and managers by the logical management of these resources are able to control or even reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in different areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,"{""Alavi, S.

Investing In Nature: Restoring Coastal Habitat Blue Infrastructure And Green Job Creation,"This study examines the economic impact of the expenditures from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administered for coastal habitat restoration projects around the United States. Estimates of the total jobs created as well as the average number of jobs created per million dollars spent are provided. The study shows that the 50 ARRA projects administered by NOAA in the first year and half generated a total of 1409 jobs. These habitat restoration projects created, on average, 17 jobs per million dollars spent which is similar to other conservation industries such as parks and land conservation, and much higher than other traditional industries including coal, gas, and nuclear energy generation. This suggests that habitat restoration is indeed an effective way to stimulate job creation. In addition, habitat restoration has longer-term economic benefits, including future job creation in rebuilt fisheries and coastal tourism, and benefits to coastal economies including higher property values and better water quality. Therefore, investing in blue infrastructure habitat restoration is a green opportunity benefiting coastal economies and societies in both the short and the long term. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"{""Coyle, G.

Automatic Site Selection Of Sight-Seeing Route In Ecotourism Destinations Based On Landscape Perception Sensitivity,"Sight-seeing route is an interactive interface between tourists and ecotourism environments. How to design tourist routes perperly and reduce the interference to the environment is an important issue to be resolved in ecological tourism plannings. Although public attitudes towards landscapes are shaped by many different factors, such as age, sex, social and economic status etc., there are also some common preferences to landscape types, especially for people with similar education background or environmental value orientations. Ecotourists are just such groups. This paper introduced the visible perception affected by landscape visibility, the best viewing distance and the best viewing orientation, and the ecological perception affected by the landscape types and the resource value into the landscape perception sensitivity model, and built a synthesis-weight computation model of ecotourism destination sight-seeing routes selection with the combination of topographic factors such as slope and relief degree of land surface (RDLS). The main steps are as follows. Firstly, the authors calculated the landscape perception degree of each landscape, then added the results together and divided the results into ten levels from high to low using the reclassification tools of ArcGIS, assigned 1-10 to each level; Secondly, calculated the slope and RDLS using terrain analysis tool of ArcGIS platform, and also divided the results into ten levels from low to high using the reclassification tools of ArcGIS, assigned 1-10 to each level; Thirdly, built the suitability computation function of sight-seeing route selection in ecotourism destinations, and calculated the weight results combined with landscape perception degree and terrain factors, then selected the best sight-seeing route using the optimal path analysis of ArcGIS platform; Finally, revised the sight-seeing route acquired automatically with field trips, expert opinion and other factors, so as to the characteristics of scenic landscape to be shown better, and the route is more realistic. This method is tested in the case of Qixiagu scenic region, Wu'an National Geopark in Handan, Hebei Province. Based on Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and high-resolution satellite images, the authors first built the virtual 3D landscape in the ecotourism destination, and then the best scenic sight-seeing route of Qixiagu scenic region was selected automatically based on the virtual geographical environment structured by ArcGIS platform. Finally the sight-seeing route was revised by field trips and other correction factors. Thus a sight-seeing route was determined in easy way where tourists can have better perception. This method can supply us a relatively reasonable sight-seeing route quickly in scenic spot planning period. The synthesis-weight computation model of ecotourism destination sight-seeing route selection provides a quantitative analysis method for the plannings of ecotourism and landscape designs in micro-scale. This method can be also applied to the evaluation the existing sight-seeing route in scenic spot. So it can provide more ideas and references for the management and ecology protection of scenic spots.",2012,"{""Li, J."",""Li, R.""}",10.5846/stxb201105310732,"{""landscape perception"",""terra = terrain""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Seasonality Of Soil Erosion Under Mediterranean Conditions At The Alqueva Dam Watershed,"The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9 t ha(-1)), contributing 65 \% of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1 t ha(-1)) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1 t ha(-1), and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314 x 10(3) kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices. This model will be integrated with World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies methods to support decision-making in that watershed, and it will involve collaboration with both local people and governmental institutions.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00267-014-0281-3,"{""terra = mediterranean""}",excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Based On The Gaussian Fitting Method To Derive Daily Evapotranspiration From Remotely Sensed Instantaneous Evapotranspiration,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant component in the water cycle, and the estimation of it is imperative in water resource management. Regional ET can be derived by using remote sensing technology which combines remote sensing inputs with ground-based measurements. However, instantaneous ET values estimated through remote sensing directly need to be converted into daily totals. In this study, we attempted to retrieve daily ET from remotely sensed instantaneous ET. The study found that the Gaussian fitting curve closely followed the ET measurements during the daytime and hence put forward the Gaussian fitting method to convert the remotely sensed instantaneous ET into daily ETs. The method was applied to the middle reaches of Heihe River in China. Daily ETs on four days were derived and evaluated with ET measurements from the eddy covariance (EC) system. The correlation between daily ET estimates and measurements showed high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82, a mean average error (MAE) of 0.41mm, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.46mm. To make more scientific assessments, percent errors were calculated on the estimation accuracy, which ranged from 0\% to 18\%, with more than 80\% of locations having the percent errors within 10\%. Analyses on the relationship between daily ET estimates and land use status were also made to assess the Gaussian fitting method, and the results showed that the spatial distribution of daily ET estimates well demonstrated ET differences caused by land use types and was intimately linked with the vegetation pattern. The comparison between the Gaussian fitting method and the sine function method and the ETrF method indicated that results derived through the Gaussian fitting method had higher precision than that obtained by the sine function method and the ETrF method.",2019,"{""Chen, Shaohui"",""Liang, Hong"",""Liu, Suhua"",""Su, Hongbo"",""Tian, Jing"",""Wang, Weimin"",""Yang, Lijun"",""Zhang, Renhua""}",10.1155/2019/6253832,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Application Of Multiple-Optimization Filtering Algorithm In Remote Sensing Image Denoising,"Denoising remote sensing images is crucial in the application and research of remote sensing imagery. Noise in remote sensing images originates from sensor characteristics, signal transmission, and environmental conditions, among which Gaussian noise is the most common type. In this paper, we proposed a multiple-optimization bilateral filtering (MOBF) algorithm based on edge detection and differential evolution (DE) methods. The proposed algorithm optimizes the spatial domain filtering kernel and the spatial domain Gaussian kernel by using the standard deviation and width of the edge response. By employing the DE algorithm, the individuals in the population based on the standard deviation of the gray value domain are subjected to iterative mutation, crossover, and selection operations to refine the latent solution vectors and determine the optimal color space for optimizing the standard deviation of the pixel range domain kernel. As a result, the MOBF algorithm, which does not require any parameter input, is realized. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, denoising experiments were conducted on remote sensing images by using evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index. The experimental results revealed that the MOBF algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms for all three evaluation metrics.",NA,NA,10.3390/s23187813,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context""}"
Remote Sensing Estimation Of Cotton Water Productivity In Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis Based On Google Earth Engine,"An accurate and quantitative evaluation of crop water productivity is the basis for the improvement of crop yield in arid regions and is of great significance to alleviate water shortage and drive sustainable agricultural development. We have considered the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis on the north bank of the Tarim Basin of China as the subject area, and the watershed SEBAL remote sensing evapotranspiration model and cotton distribution identification model are established employing the Google Earth Engine cloud platform from 2009 to 2020. The production estimation model was used to evaluate the moisture productivity of cotton in the watershed. The following results were observed. (1) The cotton production in the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis ranges from 1610.10 kg·hm−2 in 2009 to 1855.05 kg·hm−2 in 2020, with a growth rate of 13.20%. The cotton planting area extends to the edge of oasis year by year, and the center of gravity of cotton production moves 2485 m from west to east. (2) The average evapotranspiration (ET) value during the cotton growth period was 686.80 mm in 2009 and was 738.66 mm in 2020, indicating an overall upward trend, with a growth rate of 7.02%. The maximum value of ET during the cotton growth period was observed during the flowering and boll-opening stages. The higher ET value is mainly distributed in the interior of the oasis and at the edge of the north bank of the Tarim River. (3) The average water productivity in 2009 and 2020 was 0.21 kg·m−3 and 0.25 kg·m−3, respectively, indicating a growth rate of 16% in 12 years. In terms of space, the gravity center of water productivity in the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis moved 1832 m from the northeast to the southwest of Hongqi Town, with an average annual moving speed of 152.67 m·a−1. The water productivity of oasis cotton showed an expanding trend in the east-west direction compared with that in the north-south direction. The trend of spatial distribution direction had been enhanced, and the spatial pattern tended to be agglomerated. (4) After 12 years, the increased yield rate exceeded the increased evapotranspiration rate, promoting the increase of water productivity. Moreover, water productivity is closely related to the cotton planting area and reasonable water irrigation technology. High water productivity is mainly distributed in Xinken Farm in Xayar County and Sangtamu Farm in Xinhe County, respectively. The large-scale planting and intensive management of farms promoted and improved cotton production, stable distribution, and efficient use of agricultural water resources. © 2023 Science China Press.

"Impact Of Anthropological Activities On Land-Use And Land-Cover Changes In The Lower Okavango Delta, Botswana","Anthropogenic land alterations in Maun village have transformed natural vegetation into urban infrastructure, including pavements, and residential and commercial areas, leading to elevated Land Surface Temperature (LST). This urban expansion resulted from economic growth driven by population increase and tourism-related development. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCCs) and LST. Utilising Landsat 5-TM and Landsat-8 data from 1990, 2000, and 2020, we employed a random forest algorithm for supervised classification, generating Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. The mono-window algorithm was used to extract LST data from Landsat 5 and 8 images, alongside Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps. s regression analysis assessed the LST-NDVI correlation. Results indicate that urban LULCCs significantly contribute to rising LST. Minimum and maximum LST values for 1990, 2000, and 2020 were 18.6°C, 22.8°C, 22.6°C, and 26.7°C, 34.5°C, and 42.1°C, respectively. NDVI values ranged from −0.2 to 0.56 in 1990, −0.17 to 0.58 in 2000, and 0.07 to 0.46 in 2020. Roads, pavements, barren land, and built-up areas displayed the highest LST (44.6°C), while water bodies and healthy vegetation exhibited the lowest (16.1°C). Additionally, NDVI exhibited a negative correlation with LST. Our findings emphasise the role of human activities in exacerbating LST. They highlight the need for regulated urban growth patterns to ensure sustainable development. Moreover, quantifying spatiotemporal variations in LULC, LST, and NDVI holds importance for conserving land resources and enhancing land use planning policies.

Sustainable Aquifer Management For Food Security,"In aquifer-dependent regions, balancing aquifer protection, desalination, economic development, agricultural irrigation, and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping. Aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers. Despite its importance, little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown. The novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer. It develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination, the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users, aquifers, and time periods. A mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter Lotikipi Aquifer, discovered in 2013 in northern Kenya using modern remote sensing methods. While initial pumping of the Lotikipi Aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels, interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation. The model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels. Based on that exercise, a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven-year time period. A third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system. Results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of \$0.08 - \$0.18 USD per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available. While this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places, the future could be more optimistic. Advances in desalination technology, higher crop prices, technical advance in agriculture, and development of drought-resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108073,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Monitoring Soil Elements For Irrigation Management Using Internet Of Things (Iot) Sensors,"Smart farming focuses on three crucial areas: soil quality, weather conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant impact of weather and irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly integrated with smart environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients) systems for a holistic approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing soil monitoring, giving farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize disease risks, and rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible to measure various parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels, and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors is then transmitted to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth analysis, visual representation, and trend identification. The application of the IoT in agriculture is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential pillar of precision agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management of resources. Smart sensor systems provide more information about water and crop water requirements. This information can be used to mechanically manage the water supply system and help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information acquired by the first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article proposes and evaluates the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were selected to test the IoT system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically designed for soil and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil pH, moisture, and NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation water pH and turbidity sensors exhibited notably precise measurements. The results were noteworthy, with an R2 value surpassing 90% across all sensor measurements. These IoT sensors could facilitate effective crop monitoring without excessive expenditures and serve to safeguard groundwater from nutrient contamination. © 2023 Policy Studies Organization.",NA,NA,10.1002/wwp2.12151,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",Validation/calibration}"
Accounting And The Enactment Of Power: Municipal Reform By Peter Leopold 1774-1775,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the enduring, fundamental contributions of accounting practices in the pursuit of decentralization by governments, with an examination of Peter Leopold's reform of the municipalities in the late eighteenth century in Italy. Design/methodology/approach An extensive textual analysis of the very comprehensive collection of primary sources of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany during the de' Medici and Hapsburg-Lorraine's rule identified the reasons for Peter Leopold's decision to decentralize his government's authority and responsibilities. A systemic comparison of the 1765-1766 and 1775-1776 financial reports of the Municipality of Castrocaro and Terra del Sole disclosed the importance of the micro-practices of accounting and reporting for the reform. Findings In the context of the eighteenth century enlightenment, Peter Leopold legitimized his reform by the introduction of a modern style of government based on the rationalization of the municipal administrative system and decentralization of central authority and responsibility. The reform was made feasible by the substitution of a birth right principle with an economic discourse which linked tax payments to property ownership. This had the unintended consequence of increased taxes, higher municipal expenditures and possible inequalities between municipalities. Originality/value Few accounting studies have considered the micro-aspects of decentralization reforms at the municipal level and tried to identify their impact on the wealth of the population. Moreover, Peter Leopold's reform is considered one of the most innovative and enlightened of the eighteenth century, while the remainder of Europe was still overwhelmingly committed to the centralization of administrative apparatuses. Finally, this study relates to the multi-disciplinary debate about the recognition, qualification and accountization of the impact of decentralization of responsibility for the delivery of government services.",2019,"{""Castellini, Monia"",""Funnell, Warwick"",""Maran, Laura""}",10.1108/aaaj-10-2017-3180,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Surface Behavior Of Pelagic Juvenile Loggerhead Sea Turtles In The Eastern North Atlantic,"Sea turtles bask at the ocean surface, but little is known about the patterns and ecological context of surface behavior in the wild. This study investigated the surface behavior of ten juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (34 - 58 cm straight carapace length) satellite tagged in Madeira, in the pelagic eastern North Atlantic. During a total of 2273 tracking days, turtles moved through oceanic areas with a mean depth of similar to 3400 m. On average, turtles spent one third of the time at the surface (0 - 1 m depth), spending 43\% of the time at the surface during the day and 29\% of the time during the night. Generalized linear mixed modelling showed that the proportion of time at the surface was significantly larger during the day, particularly during spring and summer. Time spent at the surface during the day increased with elevated air temperatures and weak winds, probably to maximize the benefits of solar absorption. Conversely, the probability of being at the surface during the day decreased as horizontal search effort increased, suggesting a trade-off between basking and daytime foraging activities. At night, time spent at the surface was not associated with air temperature or wind speed but was instead positively associated with moon illumination. As turtles tend to dive deeper during clear nights, increased surface time may be needed to recover from deeper dives. This study presents important aspects of the behavioral ecology of the species during the oceanic juvenile phase. The findings reported here may be relevant for species management and conservation, including correction of census data and management of interactions with surface fishing gear and other anthropogenic activities.",2019,"{""Caldeira, Rui"",""Dellinger, Thomas"",""Freitas, Carla""}",10.1016/j.jembe.2018.10.006,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Quantifying Variance Across Spatial Scales As Part Of Fire Regime Classifications,"The emergence of large-scale fire classifications and products informed by remote sensing data has enabled opportunities to include variability or heterogeneity as part of modem fire regime classifications. Currently, basic fire metrics such as mean fire return intervals are calculated without considering spatial variance in a management context. Fire return intervals are also only applicable at a particular grain size (defined as the spatial unit of interest) even though they are typically applied homogeneously. In this study, we utilized a 29-yr fire occurrence database to show how spatial variance changes with respect to grain as postulated by Wiens (1989) when reporting fire patterns within the Great Plains, USA. We utilized data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database of fire occurrence for the years 1984-2012. We analyzed median numbers of fire along with their variance at four spatial grains ranging from small units (e.g., plots at 3 x 3 km resolution) to large units (e.g., landscapes at 1500 x 2700 km resolution). Median number of fire occurrences was consistently low, irrespective of grain. Despite the consistency in low median numbers of fires across grain, variance in the numbers of fires between units decreased. Variance within units, however, did not change as grain increased indicating fire-pattern-scale inconsistencies. Fire pattern interpretations depended entirely on the scale at which it is calculated. Given that the Great Plains region has a large disparity in fire patterns (i.e., some regions burn often, while others may never burn), fire regime classifications will benefit from including scale-specific variance estimates as a foundation for understanding changes in fire regimes and corresponding social-ecological and policy responses.",NA,NA,10.1002/ecs2.2343,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Balancing Model Generality And Specificity In Management-Focused Habitat Selection Models For Gunnison Sage-Grouse,"Identifying, protecting, and restoring habitats for declining wildlife populations is foundational to conservation and recovery planning for any species at risk of decline. Resource selection analysis is a key tool to assess habitat and prescribe management actions. Yet, it can be challenging to map suitable resource conditions across a wide range of ecological contexts and use the resulting models to identify effective and universal habitat improvement actions. We developed a management-centric modeling approach that sought to balance the need to evaluate the consistency of key habitat conditions and improvement actions across multiple, distinct populations, while allowing context-specific environmental variables and spatial scales to nuance selection responses that form the basis of location-specific management prescriptions. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a set of habitat selection models for Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation, species recovery, and habitat management efforts are needed in six isolated satellite populations (San Miguel, Crawford, Pinon Mesa, Dove Creek, Cerro Summit-Cimarron-Sims, and Poncha Pass) where environmental conditions differ, and the already small number of birds are declining. We used multi-scale and seasonal resource selection analyses to quantify relationships between environmental conditions and sites used by animals. All models included key habitat variables often altered through management actions to assess their differential influences across models. We found important similarities and differences among satellites, indicating that, although some rules of thumb are generally well-grounded, the consideration of population-specific environmental differences could increase the efficiency of local habitat improvement actions. Sagegrouse also had diverse responses to resource conditions at different scales, indicating that regional spatial (e.g., landscape) and local patch scale can differentially influence expected habitat improvements associated with where such management actions are implemented. Although context variables such as topography cannot be manipulated, sage-grouse associations revealed information that could guide the siting of improvement actions. This approach to balancing management objectives associated with habitat assessment may benefit spatially-structured populations with different environmental contexts and species with complex habitat needs and associations.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01935,"{""satellite populations""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
From Ers 1/2 To Sentinel-1: Subsidence Monitoring In Italy In The Last Two Decades,"The use of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) products has greatly increased in the last years because of the technological advances in terms of both acquisition sensors and processing algorithms. The development of multi-interferogram techniques and the availability of free SAR analysis tools has significantly increased the number of worldwide applications of satellite measurements for mapping and monitoring geohazards. InSAR techniques excel in determining ground deformation in urban areas, where the coherence of the radar images is high, and the obtainable results are particularly reliable. Thus, measuring urban subsidence has always been one of the main targets of the InSAR analysis. In this paper, we present a brief review on the applications, in the last decades, of both single and multi-interferogram techniques to monitor ground lowering in urban areas along the Italian Peninsula. Because of its geological context, Italy is prone to slow natural subsidence phenomena sometimes aggravated and accelerated, especially along the coasts and in urbanized areas, by anthropogenic factors (i.e., groundwater overexploitation, consolidation in recent urban expansion, geothermal activities). The review will show how the interferometric data allowed the scientific community to increase the knowledge of the phenomena, map their spatial distribution, and reconstruct their temporal evolution. The final goal of the review is to demonstrate the added value of InSAR data in supporting groundwater management and urban development in Italy.",2018,"{""Bianchini, Silvia"",""Ciampalini, Andrea"",""Del Soldato, Matteo"",""Ezquerro, Pablo"",""Montalti, Roberto"",""Moretti, Sandro"",""Raspini, Federico"",""Solari, Lorenzo""}",10.3389/feart.2018.00149,"{""added value""}",excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Mapping And Detection Of Land Use Change In A Coal Mining Area Using Object-Based Image Analysis,"Object-based image analysis was used to map land use in the Panxie coal mining area, East China, where long-term underground coal mines have been exploited since the 1980s. A rule-based classification approach was developed for a Pleiades image to identify the desired land use classes, and the same rule-based classification strategies, after the threshold values had been modified slightly, were applied to the Landsat series images. Five land use classes were successfully captured with overall accuracies of between 80 and 94\%. The classification approach was validated for its flexibility and robustness. Multitemporal classification results indicated that land use changed considerably in the Panxie coal mining area from 1989 to 2013. The urban, coal and coal gangue, and water areas increased rapidly in line with the growth in mine production. Urban areas increased from 9.38 to 20.92\% and showed a tendency to increase around the coal mines. From 1989 to 2013 the coal and coal gangue area increased by 40-fold, from 0.02 to 0.58\%. Similarly, the water area increased from 2.77 to 7.84\% over this time period, mainly attributable to the spread of waterlogged areas. The waterlogged areas increased to about 2900 ha in 2013, which was about 80 times more than their area in 1989. In contrast, the area of cultivated land was negatively related to the increase in mine production and decreased from 73.11 to 57.25\%. The results of this study provide a valuable basis for sustainable land management and environmental planning in the Panxie coal mining area.",2017,"{""Dong, Shaochun"",""Klassen, Jim"",""Knight, Joseph F."",""Pei, Wenming"",""Pelletier, Keith"",""Rampi, Lian P."",""Wang, Yan"",""Yao, Suping""}",10.1007/s12665-017-6444-9,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Classification Of County Leading Function Types And Pattern Recognition Of Its Spatial Structure Based On Multi-Source Data,"It is of great significance to study the types of dominant function at county level and analyze the spatial structure pattern for the guidance and planning regulation of regional comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, this paper uses K-means clustering analysis to classify 124 dominant functional areas of county units. Based on the Tencent location big data, the spatial structure index was constructed using the rank-size rule. The spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were identified and analyzed by combining remote sensing data. Research results show that, firstly, the use of statistics, remote sensing, social media, night lighting multi-source data, and K means clustering method in county dominant function classification can get nice results, which can objectively reflect the features of area. The dominant function of counties in Guangdong can be divided into five classes, including ecological leading, agricultural leading, industry leadership, center service, and balanced developmental. Secondly, the rank-size law method based on Tencent location big data can break through the city scale. It can be used together with the quantitative analysis of remote sensing data in the study of spatial structure pattern recognition at the meso-county scale. Thirdly, the average value of spatial structure index of agriculture-oriented and ecology-oriented counties is greater than 1, showing a trend of single center spatial structure. The mean value of spatial structure index of industrial dominated county is less than 1, showing a polycentric spatial structure trend. The mean value of spatial structure index of balanced development county is close to 1. There are differences in spatial structure characteristics of balanced development county in different regions. Fourthly, the spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were significantly different. The ecology-dominated counties showed a single central pole core pattern, while the agriculture-dominated counties showed a single central pole core and scattered point pattern. The balanced development counties had obvious coexistence characteristics of multiple patterns, while the industrial-dominated counties showed a multi-center network distribution pattern. © 2021, Science Press.

Characterization Of Near-Infrared Imaging And Indocyanine-Green Use Amongst General Surgeons: A Survey Of 263 General Surgeons,"Background: Near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) is an increasingly utilized imaging modality, however its use amongst general surgeons and its barriers to adoption have not yet been characterized. Methods: This survey was sent to Canadian Association of General Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons members. Survey development occurred through consensus of NIRFI experienced surgeons. Results: Survey completion rate for those opening the email was 16.0% (n = 263). Most respondents had used NIRFI (n = 161, 61.2%). Training, higher volumes, and bariatric, thoracic, or foregut subspecialty were associated with use (P <.001). Common reasons for NIRFI included anastomotic assessment (n = 117, 72.7%), cholangiography (n = 106, 65.8%), macroscopic angiography (n = 66, 41.0%), and bowel viability assessment (n = 101, 62.7%). Technical knowledge, training and poor evidence were cited as common barriers to NIRFI adoption. Conclusions: NIRFI use is common with high case volume, bariatric, foregut, and thoracic surgery practices associated with adoption. Barriers to use appear to be lack of awareness, low confidence in current evidence, and inadequate training. High quality randomized studies evaluating NIRFI are needed to improve confidence in current evidence; if deemed beneficial, training will be imperative for NIRFI adoption. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,"{""Birch, D.

Quantifying Abundance And Mapping Distribution Of Loggerhead Turtles In The Mediterranean Sea Using Aerial Surveys: Implications For Conservation,"In the Mediterranean, incidental captures in fishing gear contribute to the high mortality of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Understanding the effects of bycatch is complex and requires robust knowledge of baseline population parameters such as abundance and density, as well as an understanding of animals' distribution in relation to commercial fishing efforts. Based on data collected during multi-species line transect aerial surveys conducted between 2009 and 2017, we present density and abundance estimates, corrected for availability bias, for a large sector of the central Mediterranean, discuss temporal and spatial patterns and provide Potential Biological Removal (PBR) values for the monitored areas. Sightings data were also used to evaluate the spatial and temporal usage areas. Strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in density, abundance and area usage emerged from the analysis, with turtles occurring in higher numbers in the deeper pelagic waters of the Tunisian Plateau, the Ionian Sea and the Gulf of Taranto, irrespective of the season. PBR values derived from this study are likely unsustainable. This paper investigates the implications of commercial fisheries for Mediterranean loggerhead turtles across an area rarely included in sea turtle monitoring and has the potential to be relevant towards informed management and conservation of this species and highlights the necessity of international collaborative efforts in the region.",2023,"{""Lauriano, Giancarlo"",""Panigada, Simone"",""Pierantonio, Nino""}",10.3390/d15121159,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Measuring The Sustainability Of Russia's Arctic Cities,"How sustainable are Russia's Arctic cities? Russia's far north metropolises are distinctive from other Arctic cities in terms of their large size, efforts to conquer nature, and big business' impact on the urban landscape. The Russian Arctic cities' Soviet-era design gave them compact and dense population structures. Such features led to many benefits for achieving sustainability, including more efficient energy use, a larger number of hospital beds, more numerous cultural amenities, and greater access to public transportation. However, Arctic cities outside of Russia have made progress in their own pursuit of sustainability through on-going investments, business development, educational resources, and solid waste management. By teasing out these distinctions, this article highlights urban features that make it possible for the cities to adapt to changes in the global environment and economy. In doing so, it provides the first multidisciplinary, comparative analysis of 46 Arctic cities employing historical, remote sensing, and quantitative methods.

Quantifying The Impacts Of Land Use Change On Flooding In Data-Poor Watersheds In El Salvador With Community-Based Model Calibration,"Urbanization can decrease the flood mitigation capacity of a catchment, and these impacts can be measured with hydrologic modeling. Models are typically calibrated against observed discharge and satellite data, but in a developing country context like El Salvador, these data are often unavailable. Even if a model is well calibrated and tested, its ability to influence land use plans requires additional stakeholder engagement. This study uses a participatory modeling approach to calibrate a watershed model and estimate flood impacts of land use scenarios in two urbanizing catchments in El Salvador with a linked land use-catchment hydrology-hydraulic model calibrated on flood height observed by community members. This paper explores both the value of household flood observation in model calibration and differences of flood extent estimates for land use scenarios with an uncalibrated versus community-calibrated model. We find that calibration using household surveys improves model performance. Results of scenario modeling suggest that while past urbanization has significantly increased household flood exposure in one catchment, future land use scenarios that further urbanize or reforest large areas of either catchment have little effect on the number of houses at risk for flooding. The success of the participatory methodology to increase model accuracy and link results to local land use planning makes clear the contribution of social science to traditional hydrological methods to understand land use-flood links in data-poor catchments.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10113-015-0841-y,"{""participatory modeling""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Flood Effects On An Alaskan Stream Restoration Project: The Value Of Long-Term Monitoring,"On a nationwide basis, few stream restoration projects have long-term programs in place to monitor the effects of floods on channel and floodplain configuration and floodplain vegetation, but long-term and event-based monitoring is required to measure the effects of these stochastic events and to use the knowledge for adaptive management and the design of future projects. This paper describes a long-term monitoring effort (15 years) on a stream restoration project in Glen Creek in Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. The stream channel and floodplain of Glen Creek had been severely degraded over a period of 80 years by placer mining for gold, which left many reaches with unstable and incised streambeds without functioning vegetated floodplains. The objectives of the original project, initiated in 1991, were to develop and test methods for the hydraulic design of channel and floodplain morphology and for floodplain stabilization and riparian habitat recovery, and to conduct research and monitoring to provide information for future projects in similar degraded watersheds. Monitoring methods included surveyed stream cross-sections, vegetation plots, and aerial, ground, and satellite photos. In this paper we address the immediate and outlying effects of a 25-year flood on the stream and floodplain geometry and riparian vegetation. The long-term monitoring revealed that significant channel widening occurred following the flood, likely caused by excessive upstream sediment loading and the fairly slow development of floodplain vegetation in this climate. Our results illustrated design flaws, particularly in regard to identification and analysis of sediment sources and the dominant processes of channel adjustment. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.",NA,NA,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2009.00373.x,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
National-Scale Assessment Of Current And Future Flood Risk In England And Wales,"In recent years, through the availability of remotely sensed data and other national datasets, it has become possible to conduct national-scale flood risk assessment in England and Wales. The results of this type of risk analysis can be used to inform policy-making and prioritisation of resources for flood management. It can form the starting point for more detailed strategic and local-scale flood risk assessments. The national-scale risk assessment methodology outlined in this paper makes use of information on the location, standard of protection and condition of flood defences in England and Wales, together with datasets of floodplain extent, topography, occupancy and asset values. The flood risk assessment was applied to all of England and Wales in 2002 at which point the expected annual damage from flooding was estimated to be approximately (sic)1 billion. This figure is comparable with records of recent flood damage. The methodology has subsequently been applied to examine the effects of climate and socio-economic change 50 and 80 years in the future. The analysis predicts increasing flood risk unless current flood management policies, practices and investment levels are changed - up to 20-fold increase in real terms economic risk by the 2080s in the scenario with highest economic growth. The increase is attributable primarily to a combination of climate change (in particular sea level rise and increasing precipitation in parts of the UK) and increasing economic vulnerability.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11069-004-4546-7,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"
Tissue-Level Biomarkers In Sentinel Slugs As Cost-Effective Tools To Assess Metal Pollution In Soils,"In previous laboratory experiments, slugs were shown to be sensitive to metal pollution. Therefore, they might be invaluable instruments for biological assessment of soil pollution. The present investigation was carried out to validate previous laboratory results in a field study. Slugs were collected from an abandoned copper mine (Parys mountain top, PMT), from a site 7 km away from the mine (Parys mountain bottom, PMB), and from a clean site (Snowdonia Cwm Idwal, SCI) in Wales in early July 1994. Whole soft body and digestive gland Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were measured by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The digestive gland was the main tissue for metal accumulation, with significant differences in tissue metal levels between samples from different sites. PMB presented the highest Cd and Zn levels and the highest Cu levels were found at PMT. In addition, metals were demonstrated in situ by autometallography as black silver deposits (BSD) on histological sections of digestive gland tissue. The extent of BSD within lysosomes of digestive cells was closely related to metal levels determined by AAS. Histochemistry revealed that Ca metabolism and structural and reserve connective tissues might be altered in slugs living in metal-polluted soils. Finally, tissue-level biomarkers of biological effect [mean epithelial thickness (MET), mean diverticular radius (MDR), mean luminal radius (MLR), MET/MDR and MLR/MET] were quantified by image analysis of digestive gland histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. MET and MDR values of slugs collected from SCI were high, while slugs from PMB presented low MLR/MET associated with environmental stress induced by metal exposure. We conclude that exposure and effect biomarkers recorded in sentinel slugs could be sensitive, quick, and cheap indices of metal pollution in soils. A Slug Watch monitoring program could be developed similar to the Mussel Watch program, which is currently applied to assess environmental quality in coastal and estuarine areas.",NA,NA,10.1007/s002449900301,"{""sentinel slugs"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

By fusing the mapping results with four available land-cover products-GlobeLand30, GHS-Built, GAIA and GLC\_FCS-2020-a new built-up area product (BTH\_BU) was generated for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China for the time period 2000-2020. Using the BTH\_BU product, functional urban boundaries were created, and changes in the size of the urban areas and their form were analyzed for the 13 cities in the BTH region from 2000 to 2020. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of SDG 11.3.1 indicators were analyzed for these cities. The results showed that the urban built-up area could be extracted effectively using the BTH\_BU method, giving an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.85, respectively. The overall ratio of the land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR) in the BTH region fluctuated from 1.142 in 2000-2005 to 0.946 in 2005-2010, 2.232 in 2010-2015 and 1.538 in 2015-2020.

In such an ancient, urban, Mediterranean shallow lake, historic black and white aerial photographs and satellite images were screened in 25 years timestep, from 1945 for extracting land use/land cover changes. The classification took place in two buffer zones (50 m and 500 m). The changes are assessed with respect to their possible impact in water-related ecosystem services. Ecosystem services values were further calculated historically along with landscape ecology indices. The research revealed an extreme landscape makeover until 1995 with detrimental effects in the riparian habitats, with augmented pressure in the 0-50 m buffer. Artificial areas covered 21% in 1995 when in 1945 they occupied only 9%. Total area ecosystem services values rised at the expense of some provisioning and regulating services. As for landscape homogenization and fragmentation, it was already affected by human. Through this research, new ways of studying water bodies can be developed, by following the pressures’ and alterations’ evolution, aiming at better urban and management planning. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,10.1080/10807039.2020.1855575,"{""terra = mediterranean""}",excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Impact Of The Urbanisation Process In The Availability Of Ecosystem Services In A Tropical Ecotone Area,"Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified. © 2018, The Author(s).",NA,NA,10.1007/s10021-018-0270-0,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

"Gis-Based Sustainable City Compactness Assessment Using Integration Of Mcdm, Bayes Theorem And Radar Technology","In recent decades, compact urban development and smart cities are recognised as most sustainable urban form in an effort to protect natural environment. Therefore, evaluation of existing compactness and sustainability of an area is an essential task before the real development takes place. In the literature, it is possible to see some studies on city's compactness assessment and most of them have considered only a few aspects of compact development analysis. This paper aims to analyse urban sustainability of Kajang city (Malaysia) through a comprehensive city compactness assessment using geographical information system and radar remote sensing technology. To measure building density, a RADAR image of the study area was used to extract built-up areas with the aid of pixel-based and object-based classification schemes. Mixed land use development, urban density and intensity were the main indicators of the analysis. Finally, multicriteria decision-making and Bayes theorems were applied for overall compactness assessment. Building density analysis was validated using standard confusion matrix, which showed more than 90\% accuracy. Similarly, the root-mean squared error showed 0.35 for object-based classification. The results classified the zones of the Kajang city in the range of least to most compact zones with the compactness value of 0.00273-0.0146, respectively. The results obtained in this study can help local government to improve the compactness of least compact zones to make Kajang city more sustainable. Furthermore, the results revealed that efficient public transportation and proper community facilities are the key factors to achieve sustainable urban development.",2015,"{""Abdullahi, Saleh"",""Jebur, Mustafa Neamah"",""Pradhan, Biswajeet""}",10.1080/10106049.2014.911967,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Applications And Challenges Of Artificial Intelligence In Space Missions,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding acceptance in the space community, especially Machine Learning (ML), a subdomain of AI. ML algorithms now find numerous applications in autonomous navigation, spacecraft health monitoring and operational management of satellite constellations. However, a large number of surveys on the applications of AI in space missions can be classified into two categories. The first category suffers from the limitation of being old and not covering some crucial and recent developments in the field; such as the contributions of Deep Learning (DL) and bioinspired AI algorithms. The challenge with the second category lies in its being too detailed with respect to the development and application of specific AI techniques or algorithms. These limitations have necessitated the need to have a concise survey with a wider scope for those interested in the applications and challenges of AI in the space industry, especially those with technical backgrounds in other fields. In this paper, we surveyed the use of traditional AI techniques in various domains of space missions without delving into formal methods. Some bioinspired AI algorithms were also surveyed and their potential application areas highlighted. Unlike similar surveys that focus only on technological challenges, we also addressed some crucial legal drawbacks that emanate from the reliance and use of AI in space. Summarily, while discussing future directions we reviewed some advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies. Our review prioritized three application domains positioned to benefit immensely from the inevitable AI-Blockchain convergence in the space community. These include the Internet of Space Things (IoST), Satellite Communication and Spacecraft Data Security. Author",2021,"{""Ewa, G. A."",""Ibekwe, N."",""Oche, P.

"A Network To Understand The Changing Socio-Ecology Of The Southern African Woodlands (Seosaw): Challenges, Benefits, And Methods","Societal Impact Statement The sustainable management of the southern African woodlands is closely linked to the livelihoods of over 150 M people. Findings from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands (SEOSAW) will underpin the sustainability of two of the largest industries on the continent: woodfuels and timber. SEOSAW will also improve our understanding of how human use shapes the biogeography and functioning of these ecosystems. Summary Here we describe a new network of researchers and long-term, in situ, measurements that will characterize the changing socio-ecology of the woodlands of southern Africa. These woodlands encompass the largest savanna in the world, but are chronically understudied, with few long-term measurements. A network of permanent sample plots (PSPs) is required to: (a) address management issues, particularly related to sustainable harvesting for energy and timber; (b) understand how the woodlands are responding to a range of global and local drivers, such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, and harvesting; and (c) answer basic questions about biogeography, ecosystem function, and the role humans play in shaping the ecology of the region. We draw on other successful networks of PSPs and adapt their methods to the specific challenges of working in southern African woodlands. In particular we suggest divergences from established forest monitoring protocols that are needed to (a) adapt to a high level of ecosystem structural diversity (from open savanna to dry forest); (b) quantify the chronic disturbances by people, fire, and herbivores; (c) quantify the diversity and function of the understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs; (d) understand the life histories of resprouting trees; and (e) conduct work in highly utilized, human-dominated landscapes. We conclude by discussing how the SEOSAW network will integrate with remote sensing and modeling approaches. Throughout, we highlight the challenges inherent to integrating work by forest and savanna ecologists, and the wide range of skills needed to fully understand the socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands.",NA,NA,10.1002/ppp3.10168,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Tree-Related Microhabitats Are Promising Yet Underused Tools For Biodiversity And Nature Conservation: A Systematic Review For International Perspectives,"Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators. Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them, and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101 articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3\%) were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3\%) of the articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and unmanaged forests played a key role as a ""natural "" forest reference for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing, climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.",NA,NA,10.3389/ffgc.2022.818474,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Data Assimilation For Leaf Area Index Of Tobacco On The Basis Of The Ensemble Kalman Filter In Nanxiong,"Leaf area index (LAI) can be used as a monitoring index for assessing tobacco health in different growing periods. Hence, acquiring and updating accurate LAI data in a timely manner are necessary for managing the growth of tobacco. Growth information for tobacco in different seasons could provide valuable information for management on a national scale. Accurate and continuous tobacco LAI dynamics data are based on the data fusion framework of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which is an efficient recursive filter to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noise measurements, can be used to obtain optimal results. Nanxiong City in Guangdong Province was selected as the study area to extract LAI data for tobacco and test the effect of EnKF method on the basis of quantitative remote sensing data for the growing state of tobacco in 2014. Tobacco canopy hyperspectral reflectance data in different growing seasons were collected every 15 days by using AvaSpec-ULS2048 HandHeld spectroradiometer made by Avantes company in the Netherlands. Tobacco LAI data were retrieved using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which was calculated using the reflectance data. An improved tobacco growth model (LOGISTIC) was established using the LAI data collected around Nanxiong. This improved model used LAI and accumulated temperature to reveal the changes in LAI in different growing seasons. On the basis of integration of LAI data (obtained using remote sensing data) and LAI data (obtained using the simplified LOGISTIC model and EnKF method), continuous LAI data were obtained in the time series during the tobacco growing season in Nanxiong. Finally, we compared three different LAI computing methods in tobacco study: (a) calculated by NDVI, (b) simulated by the LOGISTIC model and (c) data assimilation was based on EnKF. The results indicated that these three methods could describe the growth status of tobacco to a certain extent, especially in the mature growth period, however, the LAI assimilation method was the best, which was able to adjust measured values and model values dynamically, LAI data were more consistent with the practical growth conditions of tobacco. Method (a) was imperfect at early and late growth seasons of tobacco (in these two seasons, the LAI data were either less or more), and method (b) was more dependent on accumulated temperature data (LOGISTIC model could not effectively describe the unexpected changes in tobacco LAI). The results showed that the EnKF algorithm could obtain better estimation on the basis of the dynamic model, and assimilate remote sensing data into the dynamic model to obtain optimal estimation for LAI. The assimilated LAI data were closer to the real values, and the LAI curve was more consistent with actual tobacco growth status. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Technological Advances In Drifters For Oil Transport Studies,"Advances in drifter technology applied to oil spill studies from 1970 to the present are summarized here. Initially, drifters designed for oil spill response were intended to remotely track trajectories of accidental spills and help guide responders. Most recently, inexpensive biodegradable drifters were developed for massive deployments, making it possible to significantly improve numerical transport models and to investigate, via observations, the processes leading to dispersion and accumulation of surface pollutants across multiple scales. Over the past 50 years, drifters have benefited from constant improvements in electronics for accurate and frequent location and data transmission, as well as progress in material sciences to reduce fabrication costs and minimize the environmental impact of sacrificial instruments. The large amount of in-situ data provided by drifters, covering a broad area, is crucial to validate the numerical models and remote sensing products that are becoming more important in guiding response and policy decisions.",2018,"{""Guigand, Cedric M."",""Novelli, Guillaume"",""Ozgokmen, Tamay M.""}",10.4031/mtsj.52.6.9,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Deep Low-Rank And Sparse Patch-Image Network For Infrared Dim And Small Target Detection,"Detection of infrared dim and small targets with diverse and cluttered background plays a significant role in many applications. In this article, we propose a deep low-rank and sparse patch-image network, termed as Deep-LSP-Net, to effectively detect small targets in a single infrared image. Specifically, by using the local patch construction scheme, we first transform the original infrared image into a patch image, which can be decomposed as a superposition of the low-rank background component and the sparse target component. The target detection is thus formulated as an optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularizations, which can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). We unroll the iterative algorithm into deep neural networks, where a generalized sparsifying transform and a singular value thresholding (SVT) operator are learned by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to avoid tedious parameter tuning and improve the interpretability of the neural networks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two public datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain improved performance in small infrared target detection compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",2023,"{""Hu, Y."",""Li, P."",""Lu, X."",""Zhang, Y."",""Zhou, X.""}",10.1109/tgrs.2023.3288574,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Distributional Implications Of Supply Constraints In Water Markets,"In California, after three decades of water market development, volume of water traded in the market remains lower than desired. Total volume of water traded annually accounts for just around 2\%-5\% of total water used. Vast difference in the marginal values of water in agriculture and urban or environmental uses suggest that significant economic gains can be achieved by easing the barriers to trading water across sectors. This paper draws attention to the role of state and local policies in restricting water transfers. Using novel, purpose-built, satellite-mapped data of a sample of water-trading irrigation districts in California, this paper shows how districts' water transfer decisions are made in response to conflicting pressures of drought-induced high-water demand against the need to support the agricultural economy and the environment in water-exporting areas. The time period under study is 1991-2019, which spans the entire history of water market activity in California from inception to maturity, and helps illustrate the role of changing local and state policies on irrigation districts' water market participation. Despite policy-induced restrictions, this paper shows that sample irrigation districts are highly responsive to demand in water-buying areas, have increased the volume and frequency of water transfers, particularly in the last decade. This paper highlights important research and policy questions about the distribution of economic and environmental effects of water transfers in source area communities that could affect the future potential of water markets in easing structural and drought-induced water scarcity in California.",NA,NA,10.1061/(asce)wr.1943-5452.0001563,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Salivary Biomarkers For Clinical Applications,"For clinical applications such as monitoring health status, disease onset and progression, and treatment outcome, there are three necessary prerequisites: (i) a simple method for collecting biologic samples, ideally noninvasively; (ii) specific biomarkers associated with health or disease; and (iii) a technology platform to rapidly utilize the biomarkers. Saliva, often regarded as the 'mirror of the body', is a perfect surrogate medium to be applied for clinical diagnostics. Saliva is readily accessible via a totally noninvasive method. Salivary biomarkers, whether produced by healthy individuals or by individuals affected by specific diseases, are sentinel molecules that could be used to scrutinize health and disease surveillance. The visionary investment by the US National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, the discovery of salivary biomarkers, and the ongoing development of salivary diagnostic technologies have addressed its diagnostic value for clinical applications. The availability of more sophisticated analytic techniques gives optimism that saliva can eventually be placed as a biomedium for clinical diagnostics.

Difficult Airway Equipment: A Survey Of Standards Across Metropolitan Perth,"The importance of appropriate equipment to manage the difficult airway has been highlighted by the publication of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) guidelines in 2012. We set out to audit compliance with these guidelines in all public and private sites providing general anaesthesia in metropolitan Perth. Public and private healthcare websites identified 39 sites of which 37 were studied. Institutional and ethics approval was obtained. A tick-box design audit tool, based on the ANZCA guidelines, was used to collect information regarding the dedicated difficult airway container (DDAC) at each site. As recommended in the guidelines, only equipment within the DDAC was considered. Further data about each site, including the number of theatre suites, satellite anaesthetic areas, use of capnography and categories of patients treated (adult, obstetric and paediatric) were collected. An adult DDAC was found at 92% of all sites, but none of the sites had all the essential equipment listed in the ANZCA guidelines. There was limited provision of adult difficult airway equipment within private sites compared to public, and less provision of paediatric difficult airway equipment across all sites treating paediatric patients in metropolitan Perth. Capnography was available in 76% of post anaesthesia care units and used regularly in 27%. Adherence to the ANZCA guidelines regarding the DDAC could be improved.

"Integrated Seawater Intrusion And Groundwater Quality Assessment Of A Coastal Aquifer: Galdit, Geospatial And Analytical Approaches","The pressure and dependence on coastal aquifers are on the rise in many parts of the globe. These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast’s coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches—GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQISWI, total hardness, water quality index (WQI)—and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQISWI classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand’s TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29%, 59%, and 12% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQISWI analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32%. Total hardness values indicate that 67% of the aquifer’s coverage falls under the “moderately hard” category. The geodatabase creation introduced in the study provides a template for similar studies and a baseline for future WQI and water quality monitoring. However, temporal studies on chronological timescales are recommended for sustainable management of the aquifer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11356-021-18084-z,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Monitoring Land Surface Processes With Thermal Infrared Data: Calibration Of Svat Parameters Based On The Optimisation Of Diurnal Surface Temperature Cycling Features,"Land Surface Models (LSM) have been designed to describe water and energy transfers at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface, and are therefore essential in many environmental disciplines. These numerical models, driven by the boundary conditions in the atmosphere and in the soil, require adequate knowledge of those vegetation and soil characteristics which are determinant in the characterisation of mass and energy transfers. In view of the fact that, firstly this information is often only partially known, and secondly the transfers are sometimes incorrectly represented, these models can rapidly drift and need to be regularly corrected. To this aim, remote sensing is a promising tool and many studies are currently devoted to the development of assimilation techniques to control their inputs or internal variables. The research presented in this paper contributes to this effort. Its ambition is to explore new methodologies, designed to make use of remote sensing thermal infrared data recorded from space. This study is based on the analysis of links between the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of the surface brightness temperature and the soil-atmosphere interface parameters and variables. The proposed methodology takes advantage of these temperatures cycling features, instead of absolute temperature values, to calibrate the LSM. The results show that the model parameters have a significant impact on the diurnal temperature dynamics, sometimes to a greater extent than on the temperature itself, and that these relationships have diurnal and seasonal variations. As a consequence, the use of TIR data for LSM calibration can be optimised by considering only those parts of the information which are really relevant to parameter calibration. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Monitor Land Degradation Phenomena Through Landscape Metrics And Ndvi: Gördes, Kavacιk, Ilιcak, Kumçay And Marmara Lake Basins (Turkey)","Rapid land use/cover change (LULC), land degradation and landscape fragmentation are occurring in Turkey, as a result of demographic pressure, agricultural expansion, government policies and environmental factors such as drought. This study analyzed the dynamics of LULC and land degradation as revealed in landscape fragmentation in the Gördes, Kavacιk, Ilιcak, Kumçay and Marmara Lake basins based on Landsat data for 1975 and 2000. A hybrid supervised/ unsupervised classification approach coupled with GIS analyses was employed to generate LULC maps. Various class-level Landscape Pattern Metrics (LPMs) were calculated using FRAGSTATS, in order to analyze landscape fragmentation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been prepared from the satellite data to understand the vigour and density of vegetation. The results indicated that the study area had a decrease in NDVI values, which meant a decrease in the vegetation cover, land degradation and the soil moisture during the study period. Consequently, the landscape became more highly fragmented. This suggests that anthropogenic activities driven by agricultural expansion were the main causes of landscape fragmentation, leading to landscape degradation in the study area. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Remote Sensing (RS) and the Geographical Information System (GIS) in detection, assessing, mapping, monitoring and generating essential quantitative information on the land degradation. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",2007,"{""Taǧil, Ş""}",10.3923/jas.2007.1827.1842,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Subways And Co2 Emissions: A Global Analysis With Satellite Data,"This paper estimates a global CO2 emissions model using satellite data at 25 km resolution. The model incorporates industrial sources (including power, steel, cement, and refineries), fires, and non-industrial population-related factors associated with household incomes and energy requirements. It also tests the impact of subways in the 192 cities where they operate. We find highly significant effects with the expected signs for all model variables, including subways. In a counterfactual exercise estimating CO2 emissions with and without subways, we find they have reduced population-related CO2 emissions by about 50 \% for the 192 cities and about 11 \% globally. Extending the analysis to future subways for other cities, we estimate the magnitude and social value of CO2 emissions reductions with conservative assumptions about population and income growth and a range of values for the social cost of carbon and investment costs. Even under pessimistic assumptions for these costs, we find that hundreds of cities realize a significant climate co-benefit, along with benefits from reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, which have traditionally motivated subway construction. Under more moderate assumptions, we find that, on climate grounds alone, hundreds of cities realize high enough social rates of return to warrant subway construction.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163691,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Models Of Earth's Main Magnetic Field Incorporating Flux And Radial Vorticity Constraints,"We describe a new technique for implementing the constraints on magnetic fields arising from two hypotheses about the fluid core of the Earth, namely the frozen-flux hypothesis and the hypothesis that the core is in magnetostrophic force balance with negligible leakage of current into the mantle. These hypotheses lead to time-independence of the integrated flux through certain 'null-flux patches' on the core surface, and to time-independence of their radial vorticity. Although the frozen-flux hypothesis has received attention before, constraining the radial vorticity has not previously been attempted. We describe a parametrization and an algorithm for preserving topology of radial magnetic fields at the core surface while allowing morphological changes. The parametrization is a spherical triangle tesselation of the core surface. Topology with respect to a reference model (based on data from the Oersted satellite) is preserved as models at different epochs are perturbed to optimize the fit to the data; the topology preservation is achieved by the imposition of inequality constraints on the model, and the optimization at each iteration is cast as a bounded value least-squares problem. For epochs 2000, 1980, 1945, 1915 and 1882 we are able to produce models of the core field which are consistent with flux and radial vorticity conservation, thus providing no observational evidence for the failure of the underlying assumptions. These models are a step towards the production of models which are optimal for the retrieval of frozen-flux velocity fields at the core surface.",2007,"{""Constable, C.

Over-Harvesting Driven By Consumer Demand Leads To Population Decline: Big-Leaf Mahogany In South America,"Consumer demand for the premier neotropical luxury timber, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), has driven boom-and-bust logging cycles for centuries, depleting local and regional supplies from Mexico to Bolivia. We revise the standard historic range map for mahogany in South America and estimate the extent to which commercial stocks have been depleted using satellite data, expert surveys, and sawmill processing center data from Brazil. We estimate an historic range of 278 million hectares spanning Venezuela to Bolivia, 57\% of this in Brazil. Approximately 58 million hectares (21\%) of mahogany's historic range had been lost to forest conversion by 2001. Commercial populations had been logged from at least 125 million more hectares, reducing the commercial range to 94 million hectares (34\% of historic). Surviving stocks are extremely low-density populations in remote regions representing a smaller fraction of historic stocks than expected based on estimated current commercial range. Our method could advance international policy debates such as listing proposals for CITES Appendices by clarifying the commercial and conservation status of high-value timber species similar to mahogany about which little information is available. The fate of remaining mahogany stocks in South America will depend on transforming current forest management practices into sustainable production systems.",NA,NA,10.1111/j.1755-263x.2009.00082.x,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

We measured changes to biodiversity (fish species richness), fisheries benefits (fisheries harvested abundance) and functioning (fish functional diversity) bi-annually at a 200 ha restoring wetland, and three control sites, in eastern Australia between 2017 and 2021. Connectivity and landscape context were quantified using a combination of in-field measurements, remote sensing techniques and least-cost path analysis. Biodiversity, fisheries benefits, and functional diversity increased at the restoration site over time, but these metrics did not change significantly at any of the control sites over the same time period. The delivery of each of the three co-benefits at the restoration site was also positively linked to increased wetland connectivity, larger areas of mangroves and higher salinity levels in the recovering seascape. These results support tighter integration of connectivity and landscape context to optimise and inform spatial planning in restoration, and we suggest that this is essential for supporting the delivery of multiple benefits from recovering habitats and seascapes. Adopting similar approaches to understand the drivers of restoration success would improve the ecological and economic outcomes of actions.",2023,"{""Borland, Hayden P."",""Gilby, Ben L."",""Hazell, Jackson J."",""Henderson, Christopher J."",""Leon, Javier X."",""Mosman, Jesse D."",""Olds, Andrew D."",""Rummell, Ashley J.""}",10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110358,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Effects Of Land Cover On Ecosystem Services In Tanzania: A Spatial Assessment Of Soil Organic Carbon,"The multiple ecosystem services provided by healthy soil are well known and include soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, a medium for plant and agricultural production and regulating the hydrologic cycle. Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of >0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. © 2015.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.03.010,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Review Of Remote Sensing Algorithms For Monitoring Forest Disturbance From Time Series And Multi-Source Data Fusion,"Spatio-temporally explicit forest disturbance information is regarded as a critical mechanism for net ecosystem productivity. However, quantitative and spatio-temporally explicit information on forest disturbance is currently rare for most regions of the world. Unique among earth observation programs, Landsat data are systematically collected and archived following a global acquisition strategy. The provision of free, robust data products since 2008 has spurred a renaissance of interest in Landsat and resulted in an increasingly widespread use of Landsat Time Series (LTS) for multi-temporal characterizations. The science and application capacity of Landsat have developed steadily since 1972, with the increase in sophistication offered over time incorporated into Landsat processing and analysis practices. With the successful launch of Landsat-8, the continuity of measures at scales of relevance to management and scientific activities is ensured in a short time. The spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution offered by Landsat data is well suited, increasingly established, and operational in usage for forest management and analysis. Particularly, forest change detection algorithms based on LTS stack provide robust tools for detecting near real-time forest ecosystem changes, whereby a baseline of conditions can be determined for both abrupt and gradual changes and attributed to different drivers. Interest in LTS has been further enhanced by the recent introduction of several novel automated data processing techniques suitable for multi-temporal analysis, especially after the successful launch of highly spatio-temporal resolution satellites. The benefits are enabled by data availability, analysis-ready image products, increased computing power and storage, and sophisticated image processing approaches. Thus, change detection research for forest disturbance with time series remote sensing data has entered a brand-new stage. This review systematically summarizes the research progress and application of multi-temporal forest disturbance monitoring methods based on remote sensing data sources. Considering the significance and advantage of applying time series analysis in change detection, data availability selection, and data processing, various spectral indexes and dense time automatic monitoring methods for forest disturbance are analyzed extensively, and the characteristics of multi-source data and algorithms are summarized. Finally, the improvements based on the existing limitations are explored. At the time of this review, three forest disturbance change detection algorithms are commonly used for LTS: spectral variables, classification analysis, and trajectory analysis. Spectral-based techniques range from single-band reflectance to a host of indexes calculated from different algebraic manipulations of the original spectral bands and their derivatives. Classification-based techniques are an extension of traditional change detection techniques based on two-year images. Trajectory-based methods identify trends and breakpoints corresponding to disturbance events, stability, and recovery time, and they are useful for characterizing different disturbance regimes. The strength and limitations of each method prior to conducting an LTS analysis should be understood by forestry and remote sensing communities, who should ideally select a given method depending on their information needs. In summary, unprecedented advances in the assessment of forest disturbance have been realized in recent and future years using LTS data combined with other high spatial and temporal resolution imagery, especially domestic satellites as information sources. © 2018, Science Press.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of No2 Concentration With Linear Mixed Models: A Bangladesh Case Study,"There is currently a limited understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic factors affect atmospheric NO2 concentration, and how these factors are associated with air pollution over space and time. Using high-resolution TROPOMI satellite data, this study estimates both the degree of association between climatic and anthropogenic factors, and the spatiotemporal variability of NO2 concentration over Bangladesh. Several linear mixed models were developed to isolate possible factors affecting the NO2 concentration values recorded between July 2018 and June 2019). This included monthly mean maximum temperature (MMAXT), rainfall, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), population density, and distance from industrial activities. The study revealed that the very urbanized central region of Bangladesh experienced high NO2 concentrations, particularly from September through to March. Dynamic variables such as RH, MMAXT, RAIN, and WS can positively or negatively influence NO2 depending on the time of year. Areas with a high vegetation cover, a low population density, and located some distance from industrial areas tended to have low NO2 concentrations. This study concluded that policy measures such as transboundary air quality agreements, the introduction of a month-specific green tax, decentralization, industrial relocation, and increased urban tree plantation activities could all prove valuable in reducing NO2 pollution in Bangladesh.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.pce.2022.103119,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Hiv Drug Resistance Surveillance For Prioritizing Treatment In Resource-Limited Settings,"Background: Sentinel testing programs for HIV drug resistance in resource-limited settings can inform policy on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and drug sequencing. Objective: To examine the value of resistance surveillance in influencing recommendations toward effective and cost-effective sequencing of ART regimens. Methods: A state-transition model of HIV infection was adapted to simulate clinical care in Cote d'Ivoire and evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of (1) no ART; (2) ART beginning with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen followed by a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen; and (3) ART beginning with a boosted PI-based regimen followed by an NNRTI-based regimen. Results: At a 5\% prevalence of NNRTI resistance, a strategy that started with a PI-based regimen had a smaller health benefit and higher cost-effectiveness ratio than a strategy that started with an NNRTI-based regimen (cost-effectiveness ratio \$910/year of life saved). Results consistently favored initiation with an NNRTI-based regimen, regardless of the population prevalence of NNRTI resistance (up to 76\%) and the efficacy of an NNRTI-based regimen in the setting of resistance. The most influential parameters on the cost-effectiveness of sequencing strategies were boosted PI-based regimen costs and the efficacy of this regimen when used as second-line therapy. Conclusions: Drug costs and treatment efficacies, but not NNRTI resistance levels, were most influential in determining optimal HIV drug sequencing in Cote d'Ivoire. Results of surveillance for NNRTI resistance should not be used as a major guide to treatment policy in resource-limited settings.

County Government As The “Administrative Arm” Of State Government,"The view of county governments as administrative arms of state government is also related to the limited political discretion afforded county officials in many states Diversity in the states' orientations toward local administrative discretion and local participation in policy making is also evident in the nature of state mandates. In England, county governments were created to provide regional representation for the Crown, with sheriffs responsible for collecting taxes, adjudicating disputes among residents and between residents and the Crown, and enforcing the laws of the Crown. County governments are developing new roles as home rule charters and legislative acts have expanded their authority and responsibility as local governments since World War II. The utility of county government as an administrative arm of stategovernment can also be seen in the organization of California's State Emergency Management System.

Can More Accurate Night-Time Remote Sensing Data Simulate A More Detailed Population Distribution?,"Aging, shrinking cities, urban agglomerations and other new key terms continue to emerge when describing the large-scale population changes in various cities in mainland China. It is important to simulate the distribution of residential populations at a coarse scale to manage cities as a whole, and at a fine scale for policy making in infrastructure development. This paper analyzes the relationship between the DN (Digital number, value assigned to a pixel in a digital image) value of NPP-VIIRS (the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LuoJia1-01 and the residential populations of urban areas at a district, sub-district, community and court level, to compare the influence of resolution of remote sensing data by taking urban land use to map out auxiliary data in which first-class (R1), second-class (R2) and third-class residential areas (R3) are distinguished by house price. The results show that LuoJia1-01 more accurately analyzes population distributions at a court level for second- and third-class residential areas, which account for over 85\% of the total population. The accuracy of the LuoJia1-01 simulation data is higher than that of Landscan and GHS (European Commission Global Human Settlement) population. This can be used as an important tool for refining the simulation of residential population distributions. In the future, higher-resolution night-time light data could be used for research on accurate simulation analysis that scales down large-scale populations.",NA,NA,10.3390/su11164488,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Effects Of Land Use Transitions Due To Rapid Urbanization On Ecosystem Services: Implications For Urban Planning In The New Developing Area Of China,"With the rapid development of Chinese economy, many negative effects of land use transitions under the pressure of rapid urbanization on local ecological system and environment have occurred. This paper examines the dynamic patterns of land use in Tianjin Binhai New Area experienced rapid urbanization, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2010, and socioeconomic data from both research institutes and government departments, and assesses the changes of ecosystem services value (ESV) by drawing a connection between the observed land use dynamics and the evaluation of ESV, based on the latest research of Costanza et al. (2014) and some revisions adapted to the situation of China. The outcomes indicated that, during the period 1985-2010, ESV of the study area decreased by 25.9\%, from 12,194 to 9037 billion RMBY, due to the losses of large quantities of ecological land (e.g., farmland and water body) to construction land. Then, some of the major implications for improving the urban planning of Tianjin Binhai New Area were discussed. The authors argue that it is fundamental to meet the demand of construction land for socio-economic development, meanwhile protect regional ecosystem services function and maintain its stability; only in this way can the new developing area of China realize the sustainable use of ecological resources in the process of rapid urbanization, as well as the integration of economic, social and ecological benefits.

"Terrestrial Laser Scanning For The Comprehensive Structural Health Assessment Of The Baptistery Di San Giovanni In Florence, Italy: An Integrative Methodology For Repeatable Data Acquisition, Visualization And Analysis","The ravages of time, natural and man-made disasters, pollution, fatigue, overexposure, mismanagement, and the unintended consequences of efforts to preserve our cultural patrimony, have all taken a major toll on historical structures. Structural health assessment is the first pivotal step towards creating a strategy for long-term life-cycle management. Historical structures provide an abundance of unique challenges that when combined serve as a great qualifying test for the study of as-built structures. This paper explores the diagnostic value of terrestrial laser scanning for the structural health assessment of the Baptistery di San Giovanni in Florence, Italy and proposes an integrative methodology for repeatable data acquisition, processing, visualization and analysis. The presented study proves that even under challenging circumstances, efficient documentation of entire structures is possible. The case study at the Baptistery demonstrates that even when objectives are not formed prior to the survey, comprehensive data sets of high quality and reliability will enable meaningful structural health assessments.

Deep Learning And Boosting Framework For Piping Erosion Susceptibility Modeling: Spatial Evaluation Of Agricultural Areas In The Semi-Arid Region,"Piping erosion is one of the water erosions that cause significant changes in the landscape, leading to environmental degradation. To prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran. A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use, soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land use showed that 41\% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model's ability for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.",2022,"{""Balogun, Abdul-Lateef"",""Bera, Amit"",""Bhunia, Gouri Sankar"",""Chen, Wei"",""Chen, Yunzhi"",""Janizadeh, Saeid"",""Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh"",""Quoc Bao Pham"",""Wang, Xiaojing""}",10.1080/10106049.2021.1892212,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Utilization Of Global Precipitation Datasets In Data Limited Regions: A Case Study Of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania","This study explored the potential for bias correction of global precipitation datasets (GPD) to support streamflow simulation for water resource management in data limited regions. Two catchments, 580 km(2) and 2530 km(2), in the Kilombero Valley of central Tanzania were considered as case studies to explore three GPD bias correction methods: quantile mapping (QM), daily percentages (DP) and a model based (ModB) bias correction. The GPDs considered included two satellite rainfall products, three reanalysis products and three interpolated observed data products. The rainfall-runoff model HBV was used to simulate streamflow in the two catchments using (1) observed rain gauge data; (2) the original GPDs and (3) the bias-corrected GPDs as input. Results showed that applying QM to bias correction based on limited observed data tends to aggravate streamflow simulations relative to not bias correcting GPDs. This is likely due to a potential lack of representativeness of a single rain gauge observation at the scale of a hydrological catchment for these catchments. The results also indicate that there may be potential benefits in combining streamflow and rain gauge data to bias correct GPDs during the model calibration process within a hydrological modeling framework.",NA,NA,10.3390/atmos8120246,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Characterizing Spatial Patterns Of Invasive Species Using Sub-Pixel Classifications,"Invasive species disrupt landscape patterns and compromise the functionality of ecosystem processes. Non-native saltcedar poses significant threats to native vegetation and groundwater resources in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, and quantifying spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for monitoring its spread. Considerable research focuses on determining the accuracy of various remote sensing techniques for distinguishing saltcedar from native woody riparian vegetation through sub-pixel, or soft classifications. However, there is a lack of research quantifying spatial distribution patterns from these classifications, mainly because landscape metrics, which are commonly used to statistically assess these patterns, require bounded classes and cannot be applied directly to soft classifications. This study tests a new method for discretizing sub-pixel data to generate landscape metrics using a continuum of fractional cover thresholds. The developed approach transforms sub-pixel classifications into discrete maps compliant with metric terms and computes and interprets metric results in the context of the region to explain patterns in the extent, distribution, and connectivity of saltcedar in the Rio Grande basin. Results indicate that landscape metrics are sensitive to sub-pixel values and can vary greatly with fractional cover. Therefore spectral unmixing should be performed prior to metric calculations. Analysis of metric trends provides evidence that saltcedar has expanded away from the immediate riparian zones and is displacing native vegetation. This information, coupled with control management strategies, can be used to target remediation activities along the Rio Grande. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2011,"{""Frazier, A.

Effects Of Building Density On Land Surface Temperature In China: Spatial Patterns And Determinants,"The effects of building density on land surface temperature (LST) and its spatial patterns remain poorly understood over large areas. Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, we quantified the effects of building density on land surface temperature (K) across 21 cities in China and analysed their spatial patterns, possible factors, and mechanisms. Results showed that the effects of building density on LST were more significant in areas with dry climates compared to humid climates. The spatial variability in the effects of building density on LST was closely related to climate conditions, soil type, and vegetation. The results from stepwise regression analysis showed that precipitation (climate) controlled the spatial variability, indicating that there is a complex mechanism underlying these potential factors. Furthermore, the results from climatic zoning statistics revealed that the K-values of northern Chinese cities were positively correlated with the areas of local water bodies. However, the K-values of southern Chinese cities were significantly and positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity and were negatively correlated with population density. Stepwise regression results further indicated that the mean annual temperature may be the most influential factor for southern cities. These results highlight the spatial variance and different determinants of K and suggest that climate-adapted urban design and planning standards are needed in different climate zones.",2020,"{""Chen, Wei"",""Hou, Boyan"",""Huang, Ke"",""Prishchepov, V, Alexander"",""Song, Jinchao"",""Zhang, Jianjun""}",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103794,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Potential Drivers Of Common Brusntail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Decline On A Murray River Floodplain,"Australia's terrestrial mammalian fauna have experienced severe declines since European settlement. On the Murray-Darling floodplain in south-eastern Australia, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, 'possums'), have contracted to riparian zones. Although an important possum refuge, little is known about possum population dynamics here. We examined possum population dynamics and potential drivers across two decades on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station. We related possum density to satellite derived fractional cover, (a measure of the proportion of green, non-green and bare ground cover), and contextualised these findings using tree condition and grazing pressure datasets. Possum surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2019 in riparian and non-riparian habitats and density was modelled in relation to fractional cover values of green, non-green, and bare ground. Possum density fluctuated between 1998 and 2008 but in 2018 and 2019, possums were undetectable. Possum density was negatively associated with bare ground and positively associated with non-green. Overgrazing by kangaroos likely reduced vegetation cover and diversity and contributed to possum decline, via a reduction in possum food resources and increased exposure to predation. Inconsistent monitoring meant that the population decline was not detected until after it had occurred, and management interventions were not triggered, highlighting the dilemma of allocating scarce monitoring resources.",NA,NA,10.1071/am22004,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Development Of A Telemetry And Yield-Mapping System Of Olive Harvester,"Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study, three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards. A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters. The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system. The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in alley width for SHD olive harvester.

Spatiotemporal Variations In Drought And Vegetation Response In Inner Mongolia From 1982 To 2019,"Drought events cause ecological problems, including reduced water resources and degraded vegetation. Quantifying vegetation responses to drought is essential for ecological management. However, in existing research, the response relationships (correlations and lags) were typically determined based on Pearson correlation coefficient and the resultant lag times were constrained by the spatial and temporal resolutions of the analyzed data. Inner Mongolia is an important ecological barrier in northern China. Ecological security is one of the most concerned issues of the region's sustainable development. Herein, we combined Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g) with Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terra-vegetation (SPOT-VGT) NDVI data through spatial downscaling. The obtained 1 km-resolution NDVI dataset spanning Inner Mongolia from 1982 to 2019 was used to represent the refined vegetation distribution. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) derived from gridded meteorological data was used to measure drought over the same period. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation and drought in the region in the past 38 years. We then discussed changes in different vegetation responses to drought across eastern Inner Mongolia using cross wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC). The results reveal that in 82.4\% of the study area, NDVI exhibited rising trends, and the SPEI values exhibited declining trends in 78.5\% of the area. In eastern Inner Mongolia, the grassland NDVI was positively correlated with SPEI and significantly affected by drought events, while NDVI in forestlands, including shrubs, broad-leaved forests, and coniferous forests, was negatively correlated with SPEI in the short term and weakly affected by drought. The NDVI lag times behind SPEI in grasslands, coniferous forests, and broad-leaved forests were 1-1.5, 4.5, and 7-7.5 months, respectively.

Unsupervised Bayesian Inference To Fuse Biosignal Sensory Estimates For Personalizing Care,"The role of sensing technologies, such as wearables, in delivering precision care is becoming widely acceptable. Given the very large quantities of sensor data that rapidly accumulate, there is a need to employ automated algorithms to label biosignal sensor data. In many real-life clinical applications, no such expert labels are available, and algorithms for processing sensor data must be relied upon, without access to the 'ground truth.' It is therefore extremely difficult to choose which algorithms to trust or discard at any point in time, where different algorithms may be optimal for different patients, or even for different points in time for the same patient. We propose two fully Bayesian approaches for fusing labels from independent and potentially correlated annotators (i.e., algorithms or, where available, experts). These are generative models to aggregate labels (i.e., the outputs of the algorithms, such as identified ECG morphology) in an unsupervised manner, to estimate jointly the assumed bias and precision of each algorithm without access to the ground truth. The latter fused estimate may then be used to infer the underlying ground truth. For the first time in the biomedical context, we show that modeling correlations between annotators, and fusing information concerning task difficulty (such as the estimated quality of the sensor data), improve these estimates with respect to commonly employed strategies in the literature. Also, we adopt a strongly Bayesian approach to inference using Gibbs sampling to improve estimates over the existing state of the art. We present results from applying the proposed pair of models to simulated and two publicly available biomedical datasets, to demonstrate proof-of-principle. We show that our proposed models outperform all existing approaches recreated from the literature. We also show that the proposed methods are robust when dealing with missing values (as often occurs in real-life biomedical applications), and that they are suitably efficient for use in real-Time applications, thereby providing the basis for the reliable use of sensors for personalizing the care of the individual. © 2013 IEEE.",NA,NA,10.1109/jbhi.2018.2820054,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Regional Distribution Of Salt-Rich Dust Across Southwest Asia Based On Predictive Soil-Geomorphic Mapping Techniques,"Understanding the source regions of soluble salt-rich dust is critical for military operations, monitoring potential environmental health impacts to military personnel, and for mitigating abrasion and corrosion to military materiél operating in desert regions. Arid regions are characterized by saline soils which are formed by a lack of precipitation and influenced by surrounding and underlying geology, among other factors. The dust content in soils and surface sediments in southwest Asia is commonly associated with specific landforms. This paper uses a soil-geomorphic conceptual model that integrates geographic datasets of Landsat imagery, soil and landforms, precipitation data, and geologic maps to produce derivative map-based predictions of the spatial distribution and content of salt-rich dust-sized particle in soils and surface sediments in the region. The derivative map is based on three regional dust and salt content maps and the assignment of a five-fold rating class and numerical factor value system to individual map polygons [e.g., Very High (5), High (4), Moderate (3), Low (2), Very Low (1)]. The three regional maps include: (1) dust content based on the identification of distinct landform assemblages from 15-m resolution compressed LANDSAT TM+ imagery at a scale of 1:750,000, (2) salt content developed from 1 km 2 -resolution mean annual precipitation data, and (3) geologic-based salt content developed from published geologic maps. This study presents an initial step towards the prediction of salt-rich dust sources at regional scales that is aimed to provide information to planning military operations and for mitigating the hazards of dust on military personnel and equipment operating in desert regions. The approach used to predict dust and salt sources could also be used to refine atmospheric dust loading models that require knowledge of the spatial distribution of geomorphic-based input parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-1-4939-3429-4_16,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Assessment Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Salinity Risk Using Neural Network,"Soil salinity in the Aral Sea Basin is one of the major limiting factors of sustainable crop production. Leaching of the salts before planting season is usually a prerequisite for crop establishment and predetermined water amounts are applied uniformly to fields often without discerning salinity levels. The use of predetermined water amounts for leaching perhaps partly emanate from the inability of conventional soil salinity surveys (based on collection of soil samples, laboratory analyses) to generate timely and highresolution salinity maps. This paper has an objective to estimate the spatial distribution of soil salinity based on readily or cheaply obtainable environmental parameters (terrain indices, remote sensing data, distance to drains, and long-term groundwater observation data) using a neural network model. The farm-scale (~15 km 2) results were used to upscale soil salinity to a district area (~300 km 2). The use of environmental attributes and soil salinity relationships to upscale the spatial distribution of soil salinity from farm to district scale resulted in the estimation of essentially similar average soil salinity values (estimated 0.94 vs. 1.04 dS m -1). Visual comparison of the maps suggests that the estimated map had soil salinity that was uniform in distribution. The upscaling proved to be satisfactory; depending on critical salinity threshold values, around 70-90% of locations were correctly estimated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-011-2132-5,"{""terra = terrain indices""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Emergency Post-Fire Rehabilitation Treatment Effects On Burned Area Ecology And Long-Term Restoration,"The predicted continuation of strong drying and warming trends in the southwestern United States underlies the associated prediction of increased frequency, area, and severity of wildfires in the coming years. As a result, the management of wildfires and fire effects on public lands will continue to be a major land management priority for the foreseeable future. Following fire suppression, the first land management process to occur on burned public lands is the rapid assessment and emergency treatment recommendations provided by the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team. These teams of specialists follow a dynamic protocol to make post-fire treatment decisions based on the best available information using a range of landscape assessment, predictive modeling, and informational tools in combination with their collective professional expertise. Because the mission of a BAER team is to assess burned landscape and determine if stabilization treatments are needed to protect valued resources from the immediate fire effects, the evaluation of treatment success generally does not include important longer term ecological effects of these treatments or the fates of the materials applied over the burned landscape. New tools and techniques that have been designed or modified for BAER team use are presented in conjunction with current post-fire treatment effectiveness monitoring and research. In addition, a case is made to monitor longer term treatment effects on recovering ecosystems and to make these findings available to BAER teams.",NA,NA,10.4996/fireecology.0501115,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"An Assessment Of Anthropogenic And Climatic Stressors On Estuaries Using A Spatio-Temporal Gis-Modelling Approach For Sustainability: Towamba Estuary, Southeastern Australia","Monitoring estuarine ecological-geomorphological dynamics has become a crucial aspect of studying the impacts of climate change and worldwide infrastructure development in coastal zones. Together, these factors have changed the natural eco-geomorphic processes that affect estuarine regimes and comprehensive modelling of coastal resources can assist managers to make appropriate decisions about their sustainable use. This study has utilised Towamba estuary (southeastern NSW, Australia), to demonstrate the value and priority of modelling estuarine dynamism as a measure of the rates and consequences of eco-geomorphic changes. This research employs several geoinformatic modelling approaches over time to investigate and assess how climate change and human activities have altered this estuarine eco-geomorphic setting. Multitemporal trend/change analysis of sediment delivery, shoreline positions and land cover, determined from fieldwork and GIS analysis of remote sensing datasets, shows significant spatio-temporal changes to the elevation and areal extent of sedimentary facies in the Towamba estuary over the past 65 years. Geomorphic growth (~ 2600 m2 annually) has stabilised the estuarine habitats, particularly within native vegetation, salt marsh and mangrove areas. Geomorphic changes have occurred because of a combination of sediment runoff from the mostly unmodified terrestrial catchment, nearshore processes (ocean dynamics) and human activities. The construction of GIS models, verified with water and sediment samples, can characterise physical processes and quantify changes within the estuarine ecosystem. Such robust models will allow resource managers to evaluate the potential effects of changes to the current coastal ecosystems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-018-6720-5,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Greener And Smarter Phones For Future Cities: Characterizing The Impact Of Gps Signal Strength On Power Consumption,"Smart cities appear as the next stage of urbanization aiming to not only exploit physical and digital infrastructure for urban development but also the intellectual and social capital as its core ingredient for urbanization. Smart cities harness the power of data from sensors in order to understand and manage city systems. The most important of these sensing devices are smartphones as they provide the most important means to connect the smart city systems with its citizens, allowing personalization n and cocreation. The battery lifetime of smartphones is one of the most important parameters in achieving good user experience for the device. Therefore, the management and the optimization of handheld device applications in relation to their power consumption are an important area of research. This paper investigates the relationship between the energy consumption of a localization application and the strength of the global positioning system (GPS) signal. This is an important focus, because location-based applications are among the top power-hungry applications. We conduct experiments on two android location-based applications, one developed by us, and the other one, off the shelf. We use the results from the measurements of the two applications to derive a mathematical model that describes the power consumption in smartphones in terms of SNR and the time to first fix. The results from this study show that higher SNR values of GPS signals do consume less energy, while low GPS signals causing faster battery drain (38\% as compared with 13\%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a quantitative understanding of how the poor strength (SNR) of satellite signals will cause relatively higher power drain from a smartphone's battery.",2016,"{""Basalamah, Anas"",""Mehmood, Rashid"",""Tawalbeh, Hala"",""Tawalbeh, Lo'ai A.""}",10.1109/access.2016.2532745,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms For Predicting And Digitally Mapping Surface Soil Available Phosphorous: A Case Study From Southwestern Iran,"In developing countries like Iran, where information is scarce, understanding the spatial variability of soil available phosphorous (SAP), one of the three major nutrients, is crucial for effective agricultural ecosystem management. This study aimed to predict and digitally map the spatial distribution and related uncertainty of SAP while also assessing the impact of environmental factors on SAP variability in the topsoils. A study area from northern Khuzestan province, Iran was selected as case study area. Three machine learning (ML) models, namely, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were used to develop predictive relationship between surface soil (0-10 cm) SAP content and environmental covariates derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images. A total of 250 topsoil samples were collected following the conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) approach and several soil properties were measured in the laboratory. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) were used to determine the accuracy of models. The findings indicated that the RF algorithm demonstrated the most favorable performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 mg SAP kg-1, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.99 mg SAP kg-1, and the highest linear correlation coefficient (LCCC) values of 0.96. This suggests that the RF algorithm had the least tendency to overestimate or underestimate SAP contents compared to other methods. Consequently, the RF algorithm was selected as the optimal choice. Predictive ML models were employed to digitally map SAP contents within the region. Spatial patterns of SAP contents showed an increasing gradient from west to east. The spatial variability information provides a basis for developing sustainable production system in the area.",2023,"{""Biswas, Asim"",""Hojati, Saeid"",""Masir, Mojtaba Norouzi""}",10.1007/s11119-023-10099-5,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Globalisation And The Middle Classes In India: The Social And Cultural Impact Of Neoliberal Reforms,"This book fills an important gap in the existing literature on economic liberalization and globalisation in India by providing much needed ethnographic data from those affected by neoliberal globalisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, it reveals the complexity of the globalisation process and describes and accounts for the contradictory attitudes of the lower middle classes. The authors challenge the notion of a homogeneous Indian middle class as being the undoubted beneficiaries of recent neoliberal economic reforms, showing that while the lower middle classes are generally supportive of the recent economic reforms, they remain doubtful about the long term benefits of the country's New Economic Policy and liberalisation. Significantly, this book discusses and analyzes both the economic and cultural sides to globalisation in India, providing much-needed data in relation to several dimensions including the changing costs of living; household expenditure, debt and consumerism; employment and workplace restructuring; gender relations and girls' education; global media and satellite television; and the significance of English in a globalising India. Globalisation and the Middle Classes in India will be of interest to scholars and students working in the fields of Sociology, Social Anthropology and Development Studies, as well as Asian Studies - in particular studies of South Asia and India - and Globalisation Studies. © 2009 Ruchira Ganguly-Scrase and Timothy J.

"Development, Optimization, And Validation Of Radium-226 Measurement In Oyster, A Sentinel Organism By Mass Spectrometry","Radium-226 (226Ra) measurement in living organisms, such as the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), is an analytical challenge: the matrix complexity and the extremely low Ra levels require a purification/preconcentration step prior to its quantification. In this study, 5 g of dry oyster soft tissues and 1.6 g of shell were both mineralized, preconcentrated on an AG50W-X8 and a strontium-specific resin, and measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The volumes of digestate used in the method for both matrices were optimized to reach a high preconcentration factor without any risk of oversaturating the columns. Out of the 50 mL of digestates, 48 mL and 2.5 mL were determined as optimal volumes for soft tissues and shell, respectively. To obtain a higher preconcentration factor and a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) for shell samples, three aliquots of 2.5 mL digestate were run on three different sets of resins and, ultimately, combined for Ra analysis using ICP-MS. LOQs of 7.7 and 0.3 fg/g (260 and 11 mu Bq/g) were achieved for the oyster shell and soft tissues, respectively. The new protocols were applied on relevant samples: oyster soft tissues and shell from New Brunswick, Canada, and different types of reference materials, such as IAEA-470, oyster soft tissue and IAEA-A-12, and animal bones. 226Ra recovery of 105 +/- 3\% (n = 6) was achieved for IAEA-A-12 (animal bones), the closest available reference material to shell with a recommended value for 226Ra. Resin performances were investigated using 226Ra standard solution and real samples: each set of columns could be used more than 100 times without any significant reduction in Ra preconcentration efficiency. Although the method proposed and validated in this work was developed for oysters, it could easily be applied to other matrices by adjusting the volume of digestate run on the resins to avoid their oversaturation.",NA,NA,10.3390/separations10100529,"{""sentinel organism""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Forest Burned Area Detection Using A Novel Spectral Index Based On Multi-Objective Optimization,"Forest fires cause environmental and economic damage, destroy large areas of land and displace entire communities. Accurate extraction of fire-affected areas is of vital importance to support post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact of fires. In this paper, an analytical burned area index, called ABAI, was proposed to map burned areas from the newly launched Sentinel-2 images. The innovation of this method is to separate the fire scars from other typical land covers by formulating different objective functions, which involved three main components: First, spectral differences between the burned land and other land covers were characterized by analyzing the spectral features of the existing burned area indices. Then, for each type of land cover, we formed an objective function by linear combination of bands with the values of band ratios. Second, all the objective functions and possible constraints were formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and then it was solved using a linear programming approach. Finally, the ABAI spectral index was achieved with the optimizing coefficients derived from the multi-objective problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral index, three experimental datasets, clipped from Sentinel-2 images at different places, were tested and compared with baseline indices, such as normalized burned area (NBR) and burned area index (BAI) methods. Experimental results demonstrated that the injection of a green band to the spectral index has led to good applicability in burned area detection, where the ABAI can avoid most of the confusion presented by shadows or shallow water. Compared to other burned area indices, the proposed ABAI achieved the best classification accuracy, with the overall accuracy being over 90\%. Visually, our approach significantly outperforms other spectral indexed methods, especially in confused areas covered by water bodies and shadows.",NA,NA,10.3390/f13111787,{validation},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Knowledge Graph Construction Method Of Gold Mine Based On Ontology,"Geological and mineral resource survey and scientific research in ""geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and remote sensing "" have established a large amount of geological and mineral survey data, which contain rich knowledge related to mineralization and distribution of gold mine, such as the metallogenic and tectonic setting, geological environment of occurrence, geological characteristics of mineral mine, genesis and metallogenic model of mine, and so on. The transformation from massive mineral related data to effective metallogenic knowledge has become one of the most important breakthroughs to improve the accuracy of geological prospecting. To solve this problem, through the in- depth analysis of knowledge representation, information extraction, and knowledge fusion in knowledge engineering, this paper explores the knowledge graph construction method of gold mine based on ontology. Firstly, referring to industry norms, gold mine knowledge base, and reference material of geological and mineral resource exploration, the metallogenic model of gold mine is sorted out, and the gold mine concept, gold mine entity, gold mine relationship, gold mine geological attribute, and gold mine metallogenic attribute are determined. In addition, the schema layer of gold mine knowledge graph is constructed by using the top- down ontology knowledge representation method, which represents the conceptual model and logical basis of gold mine knowledge graph. Secondly, based on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured multi-source heterogeneous geological data, the deep learning model is used to realize gold mine knowledge extraction, semantic analysis, and knowledge fusion, which enriches the data layer of gold mine knowledge graph and provides data support for gold mine knowledge graph. The gold mine knowledge graph is constructed in a bottom- up way, and the gold mine knowledge triplet is stored by Neo4j graph database, in which nodes represent gold mine concept, gold mine entity, and gold mine attribute value, while edges represent relation and attribute. Finally, the gold mine knowledge management system is developed based on the graph database. It can be applied to the management of gold mine data, acquisition of knowledge, visualization representation of gold mine knowledge graph, inquiry of knowledge, management and presentation of knowledge base, and other functions well, so as to lay a foundation for the intelligent analysis and mining of geological big data. This study develops a geological prospecting method driven by data and knowledge, and provides a reference for identifying, controlling, and managing mineral resources, which can improve the prospecting accuracy in geological exploration. © 2023 Journal of Geo-Information Science.

Intercalibration Of Vegetation Indices From Different Sensor Systems,"Spectroradiometric measurements were made over a range of crop canopy densities, soil backgrounds and foliage colour. The reflected spectral radiances were convoluted with the spectral response functions of a range of satellite instruments to simulate their responses. When Normalised Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) from the different instruments were compared, they varied by a few percent, but the values were strongly linearly related, allowing vegetation indices from one instrument to be intercalibrated against another. A table of conversion coefficents is presented for AVHRR, ATSR-2, Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+, SPOT-2 and SPOT-4 HRV, IRS, IKONOS, SEAWIFS, MISR, MODIS, POLDER, Quickbird and MERI S (see Appendix A for glossary of acronyms). The same set of coefficients was found to apply, within the margin of error of the analysis, for the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index SAVI. The relationships for SPOT vs. TM and for ATSR-2 vs. AVHRR were directly validated by comparison of atmospherically corrected image data. The results indicate that vegetation indices can be interconverted to a precision of 1-2\%. This result offers improved opportunities for monitoring crops through the growing season and the prospects of better continuity of long-term monitoring of vegetation responses to environmental change.

Multi-Index Time Series Monitoring Of Drought And Fire Effects On Desert Grasslands,"The Western United States is expected to undergo both extended periods of drought and longer wildfire seasons under forecasted global climate change and it is important to understand how these disturbances will interact and affect recovery and composition of plant communities in the future. In this research paper we describe the temporal response of grassland communities to drought and fire in southern Arizona, where land managers are using repeated, prescribed fire as a habitat restoration tool. Using a 25-year atlas of fire locations, we paired sites with multiple fires to unburned control areas and compare satellite and field-based estimates of vegetation cover over time. Two hundred and fifty Landsat TM images, dating from 1985-2011, were used to derive estimates of Total Vegetation Fractional Cover (TVFC) of live and senescent grass using the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) and post-fire vegetation greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also implemented a Greenness to Cover Index that is the difference of time-standardized SATVITvFc and NDVI values at a given time and location to identify post-fire shifts in native, non-native, and annual plant cover. The results highlight anomalous greening and browning during drought periods related to amounts of annual and non-native plant cover present. Results suggest that aggressive application of prescribed fire may encourage spread of non-native perennial grasses and annual plants, particularly during droughts.

"Heritage As Restitution: The Dadaab Refugee Camps, Kenya","Recognizing architectures of unelected migration as sites of modern history and heritage not only expands the consideration of modernities in Africa but also constitutes a form of restitution to those who have fled insecurity and violence imposed by others. In this paper and pictorial presentation based on 12 years of archival and on-site research, I argue that the Dadaab refugee camps and their inhabitation of the Kenya-Somalia borderland may be understood and valued for a long history as well as a recent materiality, which has taken form in architecture, spatial practices, and territorial construction. Rather than accepting the relegation of refugee architecture to policy studies or the applied social sciences, which privilege the logics of emergency and an epistemology of the security state over knowledge stemming from people's migratory lives, this paper takes seriously the paradoxes of Dadaab as a heritage site. At Dadaab, the Kenyan government and UNHCR established relief operations in a region inscribed with colonial and postcolonial frontiers and wars, carrying a memory of detention and an imaginary of a borderland. These modern historical forces are reiterated in humanitarian settlements holding half a million registered refugees and unregistered migrants, enacting confinement in architectures figured as much by the visual frailty of dwellings dusted red by the wind and clad in recovered textile fragments as by a spectacular array of satellite dishes, aeronautic fleets on tarmac, aluminum and polyvinyl chloride water storage towers, and hydraulic extraction machinery penetrating a Jurassic-era aquifer. These architectures signal transience even if anchored in the earth and sky, part of an ecology that once supported pastoralists and now undergirds another migratory world. My pictorially oriented paper uses these historical and aesthetic paradoxes to argue for this complex African heritage site, and with it, restitution of a fraught landscape of migration through a meaningful reconsideration of modern heritage.",2022,"{""Siddiqi, Anooradha Iyer""}",10.1111/cura.12511,"{""satellite dishes"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Assessment Of Water Quality In Lake Garda (Italy) Using Hyperion,"For testing the integration of the remote sensing related technologies into the water quality monitoring programs of Lake Garda (the largest Italian lake), the spatial and spectral resolutions of Hyperion and the capability of physics-based approaches were considered highly suitable. Hyperion data were acquired on 22nd July 2003 and water quality was assessed (i) defining a bio-optical model, (ii) converting the Hyperion atsensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectances, and (iii) adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The bio-optical model was parameterised using specific inherent optical properties of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. A MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code, complemented with an air/water interface correction was used to convert Hyperion at-sensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectance values. These reflectance values were comparable to in situ reflectance spectra measured during the Hyperion overpass, except at longer wavelengths (beyond 700 nm), where reflectance values were contaminated by severe atmospheric adjacency effects. Chlorophyll-a and tripton concentrations were retrieved by inverting two Hyperion bands selected using a sensitivity analysis applied to the bio-optical model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the assessment of coloured dissolved organic matter was not achievable in this study due to the limited coloured dissolved organic matter concentration range of the lake, resulting in reflectance differences below the environmental measurement noise of Hyperion. The chlorophyll-a and tripton image-products were compared to in situ data collected during the Hyperion overpass, both by traditional sampling techniques (8 points) and by continuous flow-through systems (32 km). For chlorophyll-a the correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-inferred concentrations was 0.77 (data range from 1.30 to 2.16 mg m(-3)). The Hyperion-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations also match most of the flow-through transect data. For tripton, the validation was constrained by variable re-suspension phenomena. The correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-derived concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.75 (data range from 0.95 to 2.13 g m(-3)) if the sampling data from the re-suspension zone was avoided. The comparison of Hyperionderived tripton concentrations and flow-through transect data exhibited a similar mismatch. The results of this research suggest further studies to address compatibilities of validation methods for water body features with a high rate of change, and to reduce the contamination by atmospheric adjacency effects on Hyperion data at longer wavelengths in Alpine environment. The transferability of the presented method to other sensors and the ability to assess water quality independent from in situ water quality data, suggest that management relevant applications for Lake Garda (and other subalpine lakes) could be supported by remote sensing.

Mapping Croplands With A Long History Of Crop Cultivation Using Time Series Of Modis Vegetation Indices,"In the study, a method of automated detection of croplands and natural grasslands using multi-year time series of the vegetation indices was developed and implemented. The methodology is based on a new recognition feature enabling identification of all lands cultivated over a long period. The new recognition feature was calculated from time series of the MODIS vegetation indices. It takes into account both intraseasonal and interannual characteristics of the vegetation period for arable lands with spring and winter crops, as well as for natural grasslands. The methodology determines: the procedure of obtaining time series of the NDVI and EVI vegetation indices for the period from March to November in the given years; generalization of the time series by land cover categories and agro-climatic zones; dates for calculating the recognition feature in each zone; calculation of the recognition feature; adaptation of the decision rules to the regional environmental conditions (threshold values for the agroclimatic zones); procedure of classification into croplands and grasslands. Croplands within the territory of the European part of Russia were mapped for the period from 2000 to 2016.

An Evaluation Of Ecosystem Services As A Result Of Land Use Changes In Inland And Coastal Areas: A Comparative Study Of Beijing And Freetown,"Ecosystems provide a number of functions that are essential to human existence and well-being. However, anthropogenic activities and climate change are severely pressuring these ecosystem services. Changes in land use/cover (LU/LC) induced by human activities affect the environment's ecosystem and alter the ecosystem services value (ESV). Decision-making on development based on ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment is significant for the sustainable utilization of resources. In the current study, Beijing in China from 1995 to 2015 and Freetown in Sierra Leone from 2000 to 2018 were used for monitoring the change in (LU/LC) and ecosystem services. To investigate the changes in ESV utilizing an ESV model, cross-sectional field research, GIS technology and economic valuation of natural capital were all combined. In Beijing, land use and land cover (LU/LC) were as follows: forest > farm > urban > water in all periods of the investigated sites. Furthermore, LULC in Freetown was as follows: dense vegetation > spare vegetation > urban > bare > water in 2018. Changes in LU/LC in two areas reflect the trend toward the agriculture sector. Prediction of LU/LC showed a significant decrease in the agriculture areas in Beijing and Freetown that negatively affected the ecosystem. Results showed a lower ESV after prediction than before prediction in Beijing and Freetown, with loss and decrease in ESV caused by excessive economic benefits. Results showed that dense vegetation contributed the most to ecosystem services overall. The finding from this work indicated that for better sustainable ecosystem services, effective land-use regulations should be taken to control vegetation deterioration and protect water bodies.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11852-022-00927-7,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Cost Of Renal Dialysis In A Uk Setting - A Multicentre Study,"Background. The UK National Health Service (NHS) will fund renal services using Payment by Results (PbR), from 2009. Central to the success of PbR will be the creation of tariffs that reflect the true cost of medical services. We have therefore estimated the cost of different dialysis modalities in the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust and six other hospitals in the UK. Methods. We used semi-structured interviews with nephrologists, head nurses and business managers to identify the steps involved in delivering the different dialysis modalities. We assigned costs to these using published figures or suppliers' published price lists. The study used mixed costing methods. Dialysis costs were estimated by a combination of microcosting and a top-down approach. Where we did not have access to detailed accounts, we applied values for Cardiff. Results. The most efficient modalities were automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the mean annual costs of which were 21 pound 655 and 15 pound 570, respectively. Hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) cost 35 pound 023 per annum and satellite-unit-based HD cost 32 pound 669. The cost of home-based HD was 20 pound 764 per year (based on data from only one unit). The main cost drivers for PD were the costs of solutions and management of anaemia. For HD they were costs of disposables, nursing, the overheads associated with running the unit and management of anaemia. Conclusions. Renal tariffs for PbR need to reflect the true cost of dialysis provision if choices about modalities are not to be influenced by erroneous estimates of cost. Knowledge of the true costs of modalities will also maximize the number of established renal failure patients treated by dialysis within the limited funds available from the NHS.",2008,"{""Baboolal, Keshwar"",""McEwan, Philip"",""Sondhi, Seema"",""Spiewanowski, Piotr"",""Wechowski, Jaroslaw"",""Wilson, Karen""}",10.1093/ndt/gfm870,"{""satellite unit medical"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

"Variation Of Airborne Bacteria And Fungi At Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum, Xi'an, China, During The ""Oct. 1"" Gold Week Period Of 2006","Background, aim, and scope: To stimulate the national economy, a so-called ""gold week"" comprising May Day and National Day has been put in force by the government, and the first golden-week holiday began on October 1, 1999. Statistical data show that about 15,000 visitors were received each day by Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum during just such a gold week period. To evaluate the effects of tourism on indoor air, airborne samples were collected by the sedimentation plate method for 5 min during the ""Oct. 1"" gold week period of 2006, and both composition and changes of airborne bacteria and fungi in indoor/outdoor air in the museums were investigated. Materials and methods: Airborne microbes were simultaneously collected by means of gravitational sedimentation on open Petri dishes. Three parallel samples were collected at the same time each day, and samples were subsequently incubated in the lab. Microbiology media were prepared before each experiment by a professional laboratory. Concentrations were calculated and presented as average data of colony-forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m3). Results: The results show that (1) 13 bacterial genera and eight genera of fungi were identified from indoor and outdoor air at Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum during ""Oct. 1"" gold week in 2006. The bacterial groups occupied 61%, the fungi groups occupied 36%, and others occupied 3% of the total number of isolated microorganism genera. (2) As for the comparison of indoor and outdoor samples, the average concentrations of fungi were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (09:00). The average concentrations of bacteria in indoor air were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00), and in outdoor air, they were lower during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00). (3) The average concentrations of five dominant groups of bacteria and three dominant groups of fungi were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00) in the indoor air, but the average concentrations of fungi were higher and those of bacteria were lower during the afternoon than for the morning, for outdoor air. (4) As for the comparison of indoor samples, the bacterial daily concentrations and fungal daily concentrations were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than those for the mornings (9:00) over the 10 days. For the comparison of outdoor samples, the bacterial concentration was lower, and the fungal concentrations were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than those for the morning (9:00) over the 10 days. Discussion: The results also show that the numbers of airborne bacteria and fungi had a daily character in indoor air and were higher in the afternoon. The airborne microbe concentrations were found to be similar to residential indoor values from other reports; the indoor museum maximum of microbial concentrations was 90 CFU/m3 and did not exceed the Chinese indoor bioaerosol guideline. However, microorganisms may fall on the surface of display items as a result of particle sedimentation and would, as such, be capable of degrading objects by way of their secretions, e.g., enzymes and organic acids. Therefore, the right steps should be taken to prevent any deterioration in the quality of displayed artifacts. Conclusions: The results show that museum air was affected by human activity; therefore, it is imperative that the number of visitors be strictly limited and that windows be opened regularly to avoid air pollution. Recommendations and perspectives: The data provide a significant scientific basis for indoor air quality control and museum scientific management. It is recommended that the number of visitors be strictly limited. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",2010,"{""Chen, Y. P."",""Cui, Y."",""Dong, J.

"A Scale-Adjusted Measure Of ""Urban Sprawl"" Using Nighttime Satellite Imagery","""Urban Sprawl"" is a growing concern of citizens, environmental organizations, and governments. Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of ""Urban Sprawl"" range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The 'scale-adjustment' mentioned in the title characterizes the ""Urban Sprawl"" of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the ""Sprawl Line"" determined by this regression. This ""Sprawl Line"" allows for a more fair comparison of ""Urban Sprawl"" between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more ""Urban Sprawl"" by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of ""Urban Sprawl"" by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to ""Urban Sprawl"". ""Urban Sprawl"" is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are 'scale-adjusted'; also, the spatial patterns of ""Urban Sprawl"" shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of ""Urban Sprawl"" are changing.

A Bayesian Game Theoretic Based Bidding Strategy For Demand Response Aggregators In Electricity Markets,"In recent years, significant development in smart metering and remote sensing systems in the electricity industry, especially on the side of consumers, it has made in implementation demand response programs in peak periods possible. The present study aims to present a game theoretical approach to the optimal bidding strategies for demand response (DR) aggregators in deregulated energy market. This model is based on the customer benefit function and price elasticity so that an economic responsive load model is applied to DR implementation. In this paper, the interaction between a system operator and aggregators in a deregulated market is modeled in this paper, where DR aggregator provides DR service to the system operator. It is assumed that a system operator collects bids from DR aggregators and determines each aggregator share in the demand response programs by maximizing its revenue function, and also, offers rewards to DR aggregators to reach this goal. On the other hand, DR aggregators compete together to offer their DR services to the network operator and in this way provide compensation for customers. The competition between DR aggregator participants is modeled as a noncooperative game considering incomplete information. This game is solved using the Nash equilibrium idea. By the implementing the proposed method, the operator's profit rises up 7 percent",NA,NA,10.1016/j.scs.2019.101787,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Prediction Of Blueberry (Vaccinium Corymbosum L.) Yield Based On Artificial Intelligence Methods,"In this paper, we present a high-accuracy model for blueberry yield prediction, trained using structurally innovative data sets. Blueberries are blooming plants, valued for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Yield on the plantations depends on several factors, both internal and external. Predicting the accurate amount of harvest is an important aspect in work planning and storage space selection. Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in such prediction tasks, since they are capable of finding correlations between various factors at play. Overall data were collected from years 2016–2021, and included agronomic, climatic and soil data as well satellite-imaging vegetation data. Additionally, growing periods according to BBCH scale and aggregates were taken into account. After extensive data preprocessing and obtaining cumulative features, a total of 11 models were trained and evaluated. Chosen classifiers were selected from state-of-the-art methods in similar applications. To evaluate the results, Mean Absolute Percentage Error was chosen. It is superior to alternatives, since it takes into account absolute values, negating the risk that opposite variables will cancel out, while the final result outlines percentage difference between the actual value and prediction. Regarding the research presented, the best performing solution proved to be Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, with MAPE value equal to 12.48%. This result meets the requirements of practical applications, with sufficient accuracy to improve the overall yield management process. Due to the nature of machine learning methodology, the presented solution can be further improved with annually collected data. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,"{""Antoniuk, I."",""Bobran, K."",""Kurek, J."",""Niedbała, G."",""Wojciechowski, T."",""Świderski, B.""}",10.3390/agriculture12122089,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Determination Of Spatiotemporal Changes In Erzurum Plain Wetland System Using Remote Sensing Techniques,"This study takes place in Erzurum city of Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey Erzurum Plain Wetland, one of the wetlands of international importance that has biodiversity and countless benefits to its environment. Studies to offer opportunities to monitor long-term changes in the area by using advanced technology economically and effectively are expected to guide decision makers. In the present study, the changes in surface area of Erzurum Plain Wetland were investigated between 1998 and 2017 by using remote sensing techniques. As a result of the change analysis conducted using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, it has been determined there is an expansion in deep and shallow water areas of the wetland. According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989–2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-021-09041-x,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Economic Impact Of Tourism In Central Finland: A Regional Input-Output Study,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional taxes in Central Finland. Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central Finland are quite significant. Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings, consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism jobs are often low paying. Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries. Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism impact studies using the input-output technique have also been conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers involved in regional planning and development.",NA,NA,10.1108/tr-04-2017-0080,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Sub-Nyquist Sampling And Measurement Of Mpsk Signal Based On Parameter Matching,"Accurate measurement of the M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signal determined by finite parameters per unit of time is significant in engineering fields, such as digital microwave and satellite communication. In this article, we propose a sub-Nyquist sampling system with two channels for measuring characteristic parameters of MPSK signals based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) sampling theory. The carrier frequency parameter measurement process is modeled as a convex optimization problem, solvable using the parameter matching method on the estimated grid. The minimum harmonic frequency of the carrier is determined to build the exact grid, and the carrier frequency is estimated through a greedy search based on the given cost function. Even when the truth value of the carrier frequency is unknown, the discontinuity location parameters can be measured with high precision using the spectral estimation method on the Fourier coefficients of the MPSK signal. We propose an upper bound on the estimation error of this separable measurement method for signals with one segment. The amplitude and phase parameters can be measured by solving a least square problem. Our proposed measurement system, with lower hardware complexity, can accurately measure the MPSK signal with K segments by sampling only 2K + 5 points in a period, at a much lower sampling rate than the carrier frequency. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our state-of-the-art measurement method. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",NA,NA,10.1109/tim.2023.3261930,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
"Synchronization, Decoupling, And Regime Shift Of Urban Thermal Conditions In Xi'an, An Ancient City In China Under Rapid Expansion","Urbanization has profound impacts on economic development and environmental quality. Some of the serious consequences of urbanization are the changes in the thermal environment, which directly affect the greater environment and quality of life. Although many studies have been performed on urban heat islands, few have specifically examined the thermal evolution of rapidly expanding ancient cities and the impacts of urbanization on the thermal environments of important heritage sites. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of the thermal environment quantified as the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and land surface temperature (LST) values from 2000 to 2018 in Xi'an, an ancient city with rich cultural heritage in China. Specifically, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the thermal environments of the functional zones and heritage sites and explore their coupling relationships with the overall temperature of the study area using a statistical analysis approach. Furthermore, we revealed time-sensitive changes in temperature regimes using the newly proposed double temperature curve approach (DTCA). The results showed that the heat island phenomenon has been intensifying in Xi'an, as evidenced by the summer daytime mean SUHI values being greater than 7 degrees C continuously since 2010 and the increased frequency of high-intensity SUHI effects. Extreme heat conditions were more frequent in the old urban area (built-up and in existence before 2000) than in the new urban area, while SUHI values in the new area deteriorated more rapidly. The changes in temperature in the functional zones were strongly synchronized with the overall temperature changes in Xi'an, and the temperature differences increased linearly with the overall temperature. The LST values in the four major historical heritage sites investigated in this study were 2-8 degrees C higher than the background temperature and were decoupled from background temperature changes. From the DTCA, we found the time periods of the thermal environment regime changes for each functional zone or heritage site, which were largely the result of policy guidance. Regional synchronization, site decoupling, and regime shifts in LST suggest opportunities for regional planning and urban landscape optimization to reduce adverse effects of urbanization on the urban environment, particularly in cities with rich historical heritage sites.",2022,"{""Guo, Rui"",""Li, Yuanyuan"",""Liu, Shuguang"",""Shi, Yi"",""Wu, Yiping"",""Yuan, Wenping"",""Zhao, Shuqing""}",10.3390/rs14112586,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Water Harvesting In The Garmian Region (Kurdistan, Iraq) Using Gis And Remote Sensing","Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the essential alternative sources of water that may be used. However, finding potential RWH locations on a broad scale has always been challenging, requiring further research. The effectiveness of RWH structures depends on their design and the selection of suitable sites. This study aimed to select potential sites for rainwater harvesting in the Garmian region of Kurdistan-Iraq, using GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. Two multicriteria analysis (MCA) techniques: the analytical hierarchal process (AHP) and Fuzzy analytical hierarchal process (FAHP) were used for comparison purposes to identify potential RWH sites. A suitability map of potential RWH systems was then generated following the weighted linear combination (WLC) and the Fuzzy Gamma methods. The outcomes showed that, unlike most recent studies, which relied on the minimum and maximum local rainfall values, a minimum agreed-upon rainfall depth should be used as a benchmark when classifying rainfall to obtain realistic results. The findings also showed that 9.7\%, 43.4\%, 33.6\%, and 13.3\% of the sites have very high, high, moderate, and low suitability for rainwater harvesting, respectively, depending on the suitability map produced by the WLC method. However, the outcome of the Fuzzy Gamma technique appeared more realistic and revealed that 10.6\%, 15.6\%, 26.6\%, 21.9\%, and 25.3\% of the sites have very high, high, moderate, low, and very low appropriateness for rainwater harvesting, respectively. The methods adopted in this study can be helpful for researchers in the field of RWH to achieve reliable results. Also, this study's findings can assist in well-organized water resource management planning to ensure sustainable water development in the Garmian region.",2023,"{""Abdulrahman, Kawa Z."",""Ali, Salahaldin S."",""Aziz, Shvan F."",""Karakouzian, Moses""}",10.3390/w15030507,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
"On The Absurdity Of Rapid Urbanization: Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Land-Use Changes In Morogoro, Tanzania","This study questions the frequent overemphasis on population growth aspects of African urbanization with little consideration of the spatial extent by analyzing the influence of population growth on the spatial expansion of the Morogoro urban municipality (MUM) in Tanzania between 2000 and 2016. Shannon's Entropy, a random forest supervised classifier, and spatial analysis were adopted to analyze Multi-temporal Landsat images obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and pattern of land-use change. Findings from this research show that Shannon's entropy values for MUM increased from 0.522 in 2000, to 0.761 in 2007, and to 0.901 in 2016 with the urban land cover recording a considerable and consistent increase. Similarly, the municipality's annual rate of change in population decreased from 4.17\% in 1967 to 3.81\% in 2016, and is estimated to rise to 4.54\% by 2030 with a corresponding population of 25,262 in 1967 and 622,000 in 2016. From the results, the rate of population growth is not commensurate with the rate of spatial expansion, as the spatial extent is more than twice the population growth. An important contribution from this research relates to the limited attention to the faster rate of urban expansion compared to population growth in African cities; a situation that is inconsistent with sustainable and resilient urban futures. It is recommended that municipal authorities should consider initiatives (e.g., environmental planning models) to reverse the current trend of urban growth in order to improve the health, density, sustainability and resilience of the urban environment.",2020,"{""Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful"",""Sumari, Neema Simon"",""Ujoh, Fanan"",""Xu, Gang""}",10.1016/j.cities.2020.102876,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Identifying Causal Changes In Landscape Greenness With Very High-Resolution Airborne Multispectral Imagery And A Panel Data Model,"To effectively manage urban environmental systems, interventions on private lands may sometimes be necessary. This is illustrated in many water districts where water agencies run programs that provide incentives to landholders to change their landscaping to meet the water agency's management goals. It is difficult to monitor, track, and evaluate landscape change programs on private land, however. To most efficiently do so, very high-resolution, time-series measurements of urban landcover would be useful, but such data is often unavailable. This study evaluates how private urban landscape change is represented in the highest resolution, publicly available, multispectral data product distributed in the United States. The study focuses on residential parcels that participated in a lawn replacement rebate program run by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, a water agency in California. Each parcel has a known quantity of turfgrass converted to drought-tolerant landscaping. The study asks if Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data can be used to detect participation in a lawn replacement program at the parcel-level. While the NAIP data product has substantial error in a time-series and urban context, this study finds that approaching change detection using a fixed effect panel data model accommodates error, making it possible to identify NDVI change. With control groups defined by matching and weighing with Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores, results indicate that observed browning at the parcel-level can be causally attributed to participating in the lawn replacement program. This ability to detect small, causal changes in a heterogenous environment opens possibilities for monitoring and evaluating programs acting on private urban landscapes, contributing to more effective and efficient design, pricing and implementation. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127380,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Harmonic Distortions In Smart Devices: A Comprehensive Survey From Conventional To Future Smart Iot Devices,"Smart devices are playing a vital role in remote sensing and monitoring of devices over a wide range of applications. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is leading the world to the next level of technology. This helps the data transmission, monitoring, and control among devices without human intervention. The extensive utility of sensor technology and M2M networking is the future of industries for the production of commercial and non-commercial applications. One such application, the Internet of Things (IoT), is the universally accepted technology of sensors and wide area networking. The extensive use of nonlinear onboard electronic components and power converter units in smart devices generates higher-order current harmonics. This causes the severe effect of low power quality and results in device malfunctioning. The increase in the use of smart devices will be a future challenge for power quality and its effect on associative devices. The main contribution of this chapter is to analyze harmonic distortions due to nonlinear load characteristics in the power management unit of traditional systems and advanced smart IoT devices. It helps us to understand the utility of conventional harmonic mitigation techniques and the need for adaptive features for the latest technology. The conventional compensation techniques are incorporated with machine learning approaches to deal with the uncertainty of load variation on real-time signals. This survey gives a brief insight into the present scope of conventional compensation techniques and futuristic soft computing techniques to mitigate harmonic distortions. Additionally, the survey is intended to call attention to researchers of the future perspective of smart devices and to make the academic community aware of existing practices. © 2024 selection and editorial matter Gunjan Soni, Om Prakash Yadav, Gaurav Kumar Badhotiya and Mangey Ram; individual chapters, the contributors.",2023,"{""Gautam, K."",""Goswami, G."",""Goswami, P.

Geographically Weighted Machine Learning And Downscaling For High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Estimations Of Wind Speed,"High-resolution spatiotemporal wind speed mapping is useful for atmospheric environmental monitoring, air quality evaluation and wind power siting. Although modern reanalysis techniques can obtain reliable interpolated surfaces of meteorology at a high temporal resolution, their spatial resolutions are coarse. Local variability of wind speed is difficult to capture due to its volatility. Here, a two-stage approach was developed for robust spatiotemporal estimations of wind speed at a high resolution. The proposed approach consists of geographically weighted ensemble machine learning (Stage 1) and downscaling based on meteorological reanalysis data (Stage 2). The geographically weighted machine learning method is based on three base learners, which are an autoencoder-based deep residual network, XGBoost and random forest, and it incorporates spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity to boost the ensemble predictions. With reanalysis data, downscaling was introduced in Stage 2 to reduce bias and spatial abrupt (non-natural) variation in the predictions inferred from Stage 1. The autoencoder-based residual network was used in Stage 2 to adjust the difference between the averages of the fine-resolution predicted values and the coarse-resolution reanalysis data to ensure consistency. Using mainland China as a case study, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) ensemble predictions were shown to perform better than individual learners' predictions (with an approximately 12-16% improvement in R2 and a decrease of 0.14-0.19 m/s in root mean square error). Downscaling further improved the predictions by reducing inconsistency and obtaining better spatial variation (smoothing). The proposed approach can also be applied for the high-resolution spatiotemporal estimation of other meteorological parameters or surface variables involving remote sensing images (i.e. reliable coarsely resolved data), ground monitoring data and other relevant factors. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,"{""Li, L.""}",10.3390/rs11111378,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Multi-Year Simulation Of Mediterranean Forest Transpiration By The Integration Of Noaa-Avhrr And Ancillary Data,"The estimation of transpiration fluxes through wide vegetated land surfaces is of great importance for the proper planning and management of environmental resources, particularly in areas where water is a main limiting factor during at least part of the growing cycle. While remotely sensed techniques cannot directly measure these fluxes, they can provide useful information on vegetation variables such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), which are functionally related to the mentioned processes. The aims of the present work were: ( a) to illustrate the use of multi-temporal LAI profiles derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data as input for a biogeochemical model (Forest-BGC) which simulates the main processes of forest vegetation ( transpiration and photosynthesis); and (b) to analyse the sensitivity of the calibrated model to its main driving variables ( meteorological data and NDVI-derived LAI profiles) in order to assess their relative importance for operational transpiration monitoring. In particular, the model was applied to two oak stands in the Tuscany Region ( central Italy), which are representative of Mediterranean forests and for which a calibration phase had already been performed. Simulations were carried out for a 15-year period ( 1986 - 2000) using as inputs daily meteorological data and NDVI-derived monthly LAI profiles. The sensitivity of the model to both input types was then assessed through other model runs with fixed values of the two variables. The results of these experiments indicated that the remotely sensed LAI estimates are the main determinant of simulated transpirations, especially during the Mediterranean arid season ( summer) when water resources are the primary limiting factor for vegetation development.",2004,"{""Bindi, M"",""Chiesi, M"",""Maselli, F""}",10.1080/01431160310001653546,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Land Use And Land Cover Change In The Bale Mountain Eco-Region Of Ethiopia During 1985 To 2015,"Anthropogenic factors are responsible for major land use and land cover changes (LULCC). Bale Mountain Eco-Region in Ethiopia is a biodiversity-rich ecosystem where such LULCC have occurred. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) determine which LULC types gained or lost most as a result of the observed LULCC; (ii) identify the major drivers of the LULCC/deforestation; and (iii) assess the approximate amount of carbon stock removed as a result of deforestation during the study period. Remote sensing and GIS were used to analyze LULCC. Landsat images acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used. Additionally, data from the Central Statistics Agency on cropland expansion, and human and livestock population growth were analyzed and correlations were made. The results showed that forest lost 123,751 ha while farmland gained 292,294 ha. Farmland and urban settlement expansion were found to be major drivers of LULCC. Aboveground carbon stock removed from forest and shrubland was more than 24 million tons. In the future, allocation of land to different uses must be based on appropriate land use policies.

"Flash Floods, Land-Use Change, And Risk Dynamics In Mountainous Tourist Areas: A Case Study Of The Yesanpo Scenic Area, Beijing, China","Flash floods have caused significant property damage in many mountainous tourist areas around the world. Focussing on the Yesanpo Scenic Area with more than 4.5 million visitors each year and annual tourism revenue of 150 million yuan, flood risk modelling was undertaken using HEC-HMS and FlO-2D. Three flood scenarios (a real event that occurred in 2012, a hypothetical flood in 2017, and a future flood scenario) were evaluated using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. The results show that from 2012 to 2017, due to the development of tourism and changes in land-use in the area, the flash flood risk increased by 28%. During this six-year period, most of the agricultural land surrounding the Juma River has been changed to tourist use and the land value has increased by 38%. Based on an inundation depth of 0.5 m, land value losses are expected in the order of 104 yuan m−2 for business use land and 0.8 yuan m−2 for agricultural land. Relative to the baseline flood scenario, the flood risk in three studied villages is expected to increase significantly by 103% under the modelled future scenario. Even where disasters have been experienced, risks are often ignored in tourist areas because tourism in these areas can generate high revenue. Our findings provide important new information for tourism planners facing the long-term effects of flash floods. Sustainable planning decisions and flood control measures are required in these mountainous areas that do not affect the amenity value of the natural landscape. © 2020",2020,"{""Chen, X."",""Chen, Y."",""Luan, Q."",""Wang, Y."",""Zhang, Y.""}",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101873,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Spatiotemporal Variation Of Evapotranspiration On Different Land Use/Cover In The Inner Mongolia Reach Of The Yellow River Basin,"The accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understanding the water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth system. This study focused on the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid region. Although there are many remote sensing ET datasets, many of the ET algorithms have not considered the impact of soil moisture, especially in water-limited areas. In this paper, the new PT-JPL model, which incorporates soil moisture into ET simulation, is used to improve the accuracy of ET simulation in water-limited areas. The simulation value is evaluated using two Hobq Desert eddy-covariance towers and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PML-V2) dataset. The new PT-JPL model shows the most significant improvements in water-limited regions; the coefficient of determination can reach 0.826, and the RMSE can reduce to 9.645 W/m(2). Soil evaporation is central to the actual ET increase in the study area. Implementing ecological restoration projects reduced the exposed area of land in the study area and reduced the rate of total ET effectively. Furthermore, the most advanced machine learning local interpretation algorithm-the TreeExplainer-based Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method-was used to identify the driving factors of ET capacity under different land use types. Temperature, NDVI, and root zone soil moisture were the main environmental factors causing ET changes in different plants. Meanwhile, temperature and root zone soil moisture had a noticeable coupling effect, except for grassland.

Evidence Supporting The Value Of Surgical Procedures: Can We Do Better?,"There is an acknowledged need for higher-quality evidence to quantify the benefit of surgical procedures, yet not enough has been done to improve the evidence base. This lack of evidence can prevent fully informed decision-making, lead to unnecessary or even harmful treatment, and contribute to wasteful expenditures of scare health care resources. Barriers to evidence generation include not only the long-recognized technical difficulties and ethical challenges of conducting randomized surgical trials, but also legal challenges that limit incentives to conduct surgical research as well as market-based challenges that make it difficult for those funding surgical research to recoup investment costs. These legal and market dynamics differ substantially from those surrounding new drug or device development. Nevertheless, obstacles could be overcome and overall expenditures could be reduced if a share of federal health care agency budgets were reallocated to generating randomized trial data, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting observational studies analogous to those that have been facilitated for drugs via the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative. Until better quality evidence is available, ethical principles require adequate disclosure of the limited evidence base supporting current surgical procedures.",NA,NA,10.1177/0003134820979792,{spurious},excluded,"{""No societal value context""}"
Catchment-Scale Flood Modelling In Data-Sparse Regions Using Open-Access Geospatial Technology,"Consistent data are seldom available for whole-catchment flood modelling in many developing regions, hence this study aimed to explore an integrated approach for flood modelling and mapping by combining available segmented hydrographic, topographic, floodplain roughness, calibration, and validation datasets using a two-dimensional Caesar-Lisflood hydrodynamic model to quantify and recreate the extent and impact of the historic 2012 flood in Nigeria. Available segments of remotely-sensed and in situ datasets (including hydrological, altimetry, digital elevation model, bathymetry, aerial photo, optical imagery, and radar imagery data) available to different degrees in the Niger-South hydrological area were systematically integrated to draw maximum benefits from all available data. Retrospective modelling, calibration, and validation were undertaken for the whole Niger- South hydrological catchment area of Nigeria, and then these data were segmented into sub-domains for re-validation to understand how data variability and uncertainties impact the accuracy of model outcomes. Furthermore, aerial photos were applied for the first time in the study area for flood model validation and for understanding how different physio-environmental properties influenced the synthetic aperture radar flood delineation capacity in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study demonstrates how the complementary strengths of open, readily available geospatial datasets and tools can be leveraged to model and map flooding within acceptable levels of uncertainty for flood risk management.",2020,"{""Blackburn, George Alan"",""Ekeu-wei, Iguniwari Thomas""}",10.3390/ijgi9090512,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Water Body Extraction From Sentinel-2 Imagery With Deep Convolutional Networks And Pixelwise Category Transplantation,"A common task in land-cover classification is water body extraction, wherein each pixel in an image is labelled as either water or background. Water body detection is integral to the field of urban hydrology, with applications ranging from early flood warning to water resource management. Although traditional index-based methods such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have been used to detect water bodies for decades, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have recently demonstrated promising results. However, training these networks requires access to large quantities of high-quality and accurately labelled data, which is often lacking in the field of remotely sensed imagery. Another challenge stems from the fact that the category of interest typically occupies only a small portion of an image and is thus grossly underrepresented in the data. We propose a novel approach to data augmentation-pixelwise category transplantation (PCT)-as a potential solution to both of these problems. Experimental results demonstrate PCT's ability to improve performance on a variety of models and datasets, achieving an average improvement of 0.749 mean intersection over union (mIoU). Moreover, PCT enables us to outperform the previous high score achieved on the same dataset without introducing a new model architecture. We also explore the suitability of several state-of-the-art segmentation models and loss functions on the task of water body extraction. Finally, we address the shortcomings of previous works by assessing each model on RGB, NIR, and multispectral features to ascertain the relative advantages of each approach. In particular, we find a significant benefit to the inclusion of multispectral bands, with such methods outperforming visible-spectrum models by an average of 4.193 mIoU.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15051253,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Rapidly Changing Emissions Drove Substantial Surface And Tropospheric Ozone Increases Over Southeast Asia,"We combined observations and simulations to assess tropospheric ozone trends over Southeast Asia from 2005 to 2016. Multi-platform observations showed that surface ozone had been increasing at rates of 0.7-1.2 ppb year(-1) over the Peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA) and 0.2-0.4 ppb year(-1) over the Maritime Continents (MC); tropospheric ozone columns had been rising throughout Southeast Asia by 0.21-0.35 DU year(-1). These observed ozone trends were better reproduced by simulations driven with satellite-constrained NOx emissions, indicating that NOx emission growths may have been underestimated for the PSEA and overestimated for the MC in the Community Emissions Data System and the Global Fire Emissions Data set. The surface ozone increases over the PSEA were driven by rapidly growing local emissions, wherein fire emission growths may still be underestimated even with satellite constraints.

Concepts Of Geotechnical Mapping For River Valley Projects In Western India,"The paper discusses the significance of engineering geology maps, choice of mappable units and scale, and their utility in feasibility, design, construction and post-construction stages. These aspects and the scale are governed by the nature of the superstructure, geomorphological, geological, tectonic and geoseismological setting of the area. In India, it is incumbent to have a geological appraisal (preferably by the Geological Survey of India) before major Civil Engineering Projects are taken up. Engineering geology mapping is expected to suit the phases of planning, design and construction. The scale of engineering geology maps varies from 1:63,360 to 1:120. Large scale maps are prepared to project specific geological features. Base maps are primarily conventional geological maps, aerial photos and Landsat imageries. Maps for construction materials portray the utility of particular deposits and their economics. For environmental and urban geology studies, a separate method of mapping is adopted. Collection of subsurface data from underground exploration by drifts, adits etc., in the form of detailed logs and maps enable evaluation of the competence of the rock mass vis-a-vis the superincumbent structure. The existing methods present the geological, lithological and structural data with particular attention to tectonic features likely to influence Civil Engineering Works. The paper illustrates these aspects from the case studies of major projects in Western India. The utility of engineering geology maps meant for different aspects will in future also include adequate geomechanical data.

Soil Moisture Monitoring By Downscaling Of Remote Sensing Products Using Lst/Vi Space Derived From Modis Products,"Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630.

Exploring Temperature Indices By Deriving Relationship Between Land Surface Temperature And Urban Landscape,"Global warming and climate change are two indispensable phenomena that cannot be overlooked. These can be inferred to the unrelenting rise in surface temperature globally. Unplanned and speedy urbanization is one of the foremost causes of surface temperature rise as it alters the landscape. Urbanization defines the socio-economic value of city and management but if inadvertent, it can lead to serious insinuations on environmental parameters. As a result of globalization and industrialization, a sheer increase in population was observed due to migration, improved health facilities, better job opportunities and superior living standards. It is necessary to inculcate the demand of these rising urban dwellers in the form of infrastructure, energy, clean air and water. As a result of this, landscape restructuring befalls that can be understood by conversion of green or open spaces into concrete structures. This alters the surface properties causing changes in latent and sensible heat flux leading to increased surface temperature as well as ambient air temperatures. With clustered urban spaces and decrease in vegetation cover and water that acts as sinks, the temperature of urban region shoots more than nearby rural areas leading to the development of urban heat islands. These parameters are directly and indirectly related to air pollution, increased summer days, energy requirement, heat-related diseases, emission of GHGs (greenhouse gases). The communication focuses on the recent challenges and criticism faced by developing Indian cities with very minimum landscape to house burgeoning population, immediate strategies and action-plan required to tackle increasing temperatures and mitigate negative environmental impacts and effects on human beings. The study is an attempt to establish a relationship between surface temperature and land use pattern for Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Study also deals with the estimation of various temperature indices for defining and understanding the variation in surface temperature precisely.

"Interannual Variation In Commercial Oyster (Crassostrea Gigas) Farming In The Sea (Florianopolis, Brazil, 27°44′ S; 48°33′ W) In Relation To Temperature, Chlorophyll A And Associated Oceanographic Conditions","Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g. temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W 30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture management and genetics were standardized significant differences verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Two Concepts Of Secularism,"Secularism, for many of us, is not a terra incognita, and yet it is certainly an improperly defined and unexplained concept. For more than 150 years, intellectuals, politicians, and theologians have used secular and secularism in a rather ambiguous way. These terms therefore need to be clarified. The time has come to rethink our whole approach to the question of secularism. Given the inapplicability of the French model of secularism to the Muslim world, it becomes necessary to find a criterion by which state involvement, when it occurs in the domain of religion, can appear to the members of a religious group as both legitimate and fair. The Indian concept of secularism based on the toleration and equal protection of all religious communities without being supportive of any particular religion can supply this criterion. That said, to pursue a secular politics of rejecting sectarianism and demanding toleration requires that strategic priorities be rearranged without making historical shortcuts. In this case, a secular politics of toleration is a twofold struggle, a resistance to uniformization and an invitation to democratization. If such a strategy is to find any role in the regulation of the lives and activities of Islamic societies today, an alternative concept of secularism, rather than simply an alternative to it, needs to be worked out. The challenge is not to abandon secularism but to formulate it as a philosophy with spiritual values, rather than solely a policy of the state. This is the only way of rethinking our whole approach to the future in Muslim societies to the extent that the pluralist model of a ""shared home"" can be presented as ""a third way"" solution to the crisis of political societies in the Middle East and in opposition to the secular authoritarianism of the state and the rise of religious fundamentalism in civil society. © 2011 by Duke University Press.",NA,NA,10.1215/1089201x-2010-047,"{""terra incognita"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
A Meta-Analysis Of Terrestrial Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Lidar Remote Sensing,"Estimating biomass of terrestrial vegetation is not only a rapidly expanding research area, but also a subject of tremendous interest for reducing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

Agro-Climatic Classification Systems For Estimating The Global Distribution Of Livestock Numbers And Commodities,"Investment in agricultural research in developing countries is being increasingly targeted at those agro-climatic zones and issues where the economic and environmental benefits may be expected to be greatest. This first requires that the zones themselves be defined, along with information on domestic livestock numbers and commodity output within agro-climatic zones in different countries. Different methods for classifying agro-climatic zones were compared. These included methods based on estimated length of growing period (LGP) using rainfall and temperature data, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (PET), and on more detailed agronomic models, remote sensing data and land use information. Zonation based on LGP has already been linked to existing national livestock data. By defining agro-climatic zones and relating concentrations of livestock populations to those of humans, it is possible to make realistic estimates of livestock populations and the production of livestock commodities for most developing countries. Detailed agro-climatic analyses. of Mainland East Asia and Sri Lanka have recently been undertaken using the GROWEST agronomic model. Using this model as the basis of agro-climatic classification appears to be significantly superior, particularly in temperate environments, to approaches based solely on LGP. Different ways of subdividing countries and continents into agro-climatic or agro-ecological zones (AEZs) are reviewed in this paper. In addition, we show how the numbers of production and commodities from domestic livestock can be allocated to such zones. We also indicate how some of this information can be applied.

Home Telemonitoring And Remote Feedback Between Clinic Visits For Asthma,"Background: Asthma is a chronic disease that causes reversible narrowing of the airways due to bronchoconstriction, inflammation and mucus production. Asthma continues to be associated with significant avoidable morbidity and mortality. Self management facilitated by a healthcare professional is important to keep symptoms controlled and to prevent exacerbations. Telephone and Internet technologies can now be used by patients to measure lung function and asthma symptoms at home. Patients can then share this information electronically with their healthcare provider, who can provide feedback between clinic visits. Technology can be used in this manner to improve health outcomes and prevent the need for emergency treatment for people with asthma and other long-term health conditions. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of home telemonitoring with healthcare professional feedback between clinic visits, compared with usual care. Search methods: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to May 2016. We also searched www.clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information. Selection criteria: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults or children with asthma in which any form of technology was used to measure and share asthma monitoring data with a healthcare provider between clinic visits, compared with other monitoring or usual care. We excluded trials in which technologies were used for monitoring with no input from a doctor or nurse. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened the search and independently extracted risk of bias and numerical data, resolving disagreements by consensus. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) while using study participants as the unit of analysis, and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) while using random-effects models. We rated evidence for all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach. Main results: We found 18 studies including 2268 participants: 12 in adults, 5 in children and one in individuals from both age groups. Studies generally recruited people with mild to moderate persistent asthma and followed them for between three and 12 months. People in the intervention group were given one of a variety of technologies to record and share their symptoms (text messaging, Web systems or phone calls), compared with a group of people who received usual care or a control intervention. Evidence from these studies did not show clearly whether asthma telemonitoring with feedback from a healthcare professional increases or decreases the odds of exacerbations that require a course of oral steroids (OR 0.93, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.44; 466 participants; four studies), a visit to the emergency department (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.58; 1018 participants; eight studies) or a stay in hospital (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.49; 1042 participants; 10 studies) compared with usual care. Our confidence was limited by imprecision in all three primary outcomes. Evidence quality ratings ranged from moderate to very low. None of the studies recorded serious or non-serious adverse events separately from asthma exacerbations. Evidence for measures of asthma control was imprecise and inconsistent, revealing possible benefit over usual care for quality of life (MD 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; 796 participants; six studies; I2 = 54%), but the effect was small and study results varied. Telemonitoring interventions may provide additional benefit for two measures of lung function. Authors' conclusions: Current evidence does not support the widespread implementation of telemonitoring with healthcare provider feedback between asthma clinic visits. Studies have not yet proven that additional telemonitori g strategies lead to better symptom control or reduced need for oral steroids over usual asthma care, nor have they ruled out unintended harms. Investigators noted small benefits for quality of life, but these are subject to risk of bias, as the studies were unblinded. Similarly, some benefits for lung function are uncertain owing to possible attrition bias. Larger pragmatic studies in children and adults could better determine the real-world benefits of these interventions for preventing exacerbations and avoiding harms; it is difficult to generalise results from this review because benefits may be explained at least in part by the increased attention participants receive by taking part in clinical trials. Qualitative studies could inform future research by focusing on patient and provider preferences, or by identifying subgroups of patients who are more likely to attain benefit from closer monitoring, such as those who have frequent asthma attacks. © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.",2016,"{""Cates, C.

Artificial Intelligence Framework For Modeling And Predicting Crop Yield To Enhance Food Security In Saudi Arabia,"Predicting crop yields is a critical issue in agricultural production optimization and intensification research. Accurate foresights of natural circumstances a year in advance can have a considerable impact on management decisions regarding crop selection, rotational location in crop rotations, agrotechnical methods employed, and long-term land use planning. One of the most important aspects of precision farming is sustainability. The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R\%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70\% for training and 30\% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100\%) and (R-2 = 96.33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process. The temperature, insecticides, and rainfall were examined with different crop yields to confirm the effectiveness of these parameters for increasing product crop yields in Saudi Arabia; we found that these items had highest relationships. The average values are R = 98.20\%, 96.50, and 99.14\% with for the temperature, insecticides, and rainfall, respectively. Based on these findings, it appeared that each of the parameter categories that are considered (temperature, pesticides, and rainfall) had a similar contribution to the accuracy of anticipated yield projection.",NA,NA,10.7717/peerj-cs.1104,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Soil Erosion Estimates In Arid Region: A Case Study Of The Koutine Catchment, Southeastern Tunisia","Soil erosion remains one of the principal environmental problems in arid regions. This study aims to assess and quantify the variability of soil erosion in the Koutine catchment using the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model. The Koutine catchment is located in an arid area in southeastern Tunisia and is characterized by an annual mean precipitation of less than 200 mm. The model was used to examine the influence of topography, extreme rainstorm intensity and soil texture on soil loss. The data used for model validation were obtained from field measurements by monitoring deposited sediment in settlement basins of 25 cisterns (a traditional water harvesting and storage technique) over 4 years, from 2015 to 2018. Results showed that slope is the most controlling factor of soil loss. The average annual soil loss in monitoring sites varies between 0.01 and 12.5 t/ha/y. The storm events inducing the largest soil losses occurred in the upstream part of the Koutine catchment with a maximum value of 7.3 t/ha per event. Soil erosion is highly affected by initial and preceding soil conditions. The RUSLE model reasonably reproduced (R-2 = 0.81) the spatiotemporal variability of measured soil losses in the study catchment during the observation period. This study revealed the importance of using the cisterns in the data-scarce dry areas as a substitute for the classic soil erosion monitoring fields. Besides, combining modeling of outputs and field measurements could improve our physical understanding of soil erosion processes and their controlling factors in an arid catchment. The study results are beneficial for decision-makers to evaluate the existing soil conservation and water management plans, which can be further adjusted using appropriate soil erosion mitigation options based on scientific evidence.",NA,NA,10.3390/app11156763,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Advancing Marine Biogeochemical And Ecosystem Reanalyses And Forecasts As Tools For Monitoring And Managing Ecosystem Health,"Ocean ecosystems are subject to a multitude of stressors, including changes in ocean physics and biogeochemistry, and direct anthropogenic influences. Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools. These can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, and anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies. Analysis and prediction tools are defined here as ocean circulation models that are coupled to biogeochemical or ecological models. The range of potential applications for these systems is broad, ranging from reanalyses for the assessment of past and current states, and short-term and seasonal forecasts, to scenario simulations including climate change projections. The objectives of this article are to illustrate current capabilities with regard to the three types of applications, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities. Representative examples of global and regional systems are described with particular emphasis on those in operational or pre-operational use. With regard to the benefits and challenges, similar considerations apply to biogeochemical and ecological prediction systems as do to physical systems. However, at present there are at least two major differences: (1) biogeochemical observation streams are much sparser than physical streams presenting a significant hinderance, and (2) biogeochemical and ecological models are largely unconstrained because of insufficient observations. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems will allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, with multiple societal benefits.",NA,NA,10.3389/fmars.2019.00089,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Risks To Carbon Storage From Land-Use Change Revealed By Peat Thickness Maps Of Peru,"Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems but land-use change has led to the loss of large peatland areas, associated with substantial greenhouse gas emissions. To design effective conservation and restoration policies, maps of the location and carbon storage of tropical peatlands are vital. This is especially so in countries such as Peru where the distribution of its large, hydrologically intact peatlands is poorly known. Here field and remote sensing data support the model development of peatland extent and thickness for lowland Peruvian Amazonia. We estimate a peatland area of 62,714 km(2) (5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles of 58,325 and 67,102 km(2), respectively) and carbon stock of 5.4 (2.6-10.6) PgC, a value approaching the entire above-ground carbon stock of Peru but contained within just 5\% of its land area. Combining the map of peatland extent with national land-cover data we reveal small but growing areas of deforestation and associated CO2 emissions from peat decomposition due to conversion to mining, urban areas and agriculture. The emissions from peatland areas classified as forest in 2000 represent 1-4\% of Peruvian CO2 forest emissions between 2000 and 2016. We suggest that bespoke monitoring, protection and sustainable management of tropical peatlands are required to avoid further degradation and CO2 emissions.",2022,"{""Akesson, Christine M."",""Baker, Timothy R."",""Cole, Lydia E.

A Comparison Of Dem-Based Indexes For Targeting The Placement Of Vegetative Buffers In Agricultural Watersheds,"Targeted placement of vegetative buffers may increase their effectiveness for improving water quality in agricultural watersheds. The use of digital elevation models (DEMs) enables precise mapping of runoff pathways for identifying where greater runoff loads can be intercepted and treated with buffers. Five different DEM-based targeting indexes were compared and contrasted for the degree to which they identify similar locations in watersheds: Flow Accumulation {[}S.K. Jenson and J.O. Domingue (1988). Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 54:1593], Wetness Index {[}I.D. Moore, R.B. Grayson, and A.R. Ladson (1991). Hydrological Processes 5:3], Topographic Index {[}M.T.

Results showed that they all tend to target similar locations in both watersheds which traces to the importance of larger contributing area to the rankings by each index. Disagreement among indexes traces to other variables which enable more accurate targeting under particular hydrologic circumstances. Effective use of these indexes poses special challenges, including selecting an index that better describes the hydrologic circumstances in a watershed and is simple enough to use, ensuring the accuracy of the DEM, and determining a maximum index value for the appropriateness of vegetative buffers. When properly applied, each index can provide a standardized basis and effective spatial resolution for targeting buffer placement in watersheds.",NA,NA,10.1111/jawr.12083,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Estimation And Assessment Of The Root Zone Soil Moisture From Near-Surface Measurements Over Huai River Basin,"Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is a vital variable for agricultural production, water resource management and runoff prediction. Satellites provide large-scale and long-term near-surface soil moisture retrievals, which can be used to estimate RZSM through various methods. In this study, we tested the utility of an exponential filter (ExpF) using in situ soil moisture by optimizing the optimal characteristic time length T_opt for different soil depths. Furthermore, the parameter analysis showed that T_opt correlated negatively with precipitation and had no significant correlation with selected soil properties. Two approaches were taken to obtain T_opt: (1) optimization of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE); (2) calculation based on annual average precipitation. The precipitation-based T_pre outperformed the station-specific T_opt and stations-averaged T_opt. To apply the ExpF on grid scale, the precipitation-based T_pre considering spatial variability was adopted in the ExpF to obtain RZSM from a new soil moisture dataset RF_SMAP_L3_P (Random Forest Soil Moisture Active Passive_L3_Passive) continuous in time and space over Huai River Basin. Finally, the performance of RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM (0–100 cm) was evaluated using in situ measurements and compared with mainstream products, for instance, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Level 4 (SMOS L4) RZSM. The results indicated that RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM could captured the temporal variation of measured RZSM best with R value of 0.586, followed by SMAP L4, which had the lowest bias value of 0.03, and SMOS L4 significantly underestimated the measured RZSM with bias value of −0.048 in the basin. Higher accuracy of RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM was found in the flood period compared with the non-flood period, which indicates a better application for ExpF in wetter weather conditions. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,"{""Ding, Z."",""Gou, Q."",""Horton, R."",""Liu, E."",""Lü, H."",""Pan, Y."",""Wang, X."",""Xu, H."",""Zhu, Y.""}",10.3390/atmos14010124,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}

Geoinformation Support For Safe Operation Of Pipeline Transport,"The relevance of the research is determined by the need to minimize the losses at all stages of the cycle of processing and transportation of hydrocarbon raw materials and reduce environmental pollution from leaks in pipelines. Ensuring the safety of the functioning of pipeline systems requires performing operational assessments of situations at any of natural and economic objects within pipeline segment. The most advanced tools for solving analytical problems are technologies of geoinformation mapping. The general purpose of the created cartographic images is to help in organizing the safe placement of industrial facilities during construction and performing environmentalgeodynamic monitoring during pipeline operation. The main aim was to analyze the possibilities of using various geospatial information that contributes to the safe operation of pipeline systems, processed through geoinformation technologies. To achieve this goal, the work examines the domestic and international experience in preventing and eliminating oil spills, and develops requirements for GIS technology that accumulates information about natural and man-made processes. Objects. Composition of information and modules for simulation environment composed of GIS must contain the software for analysis of condition of the components of pipeline infrastructure: primary and backup threads, loopings, branches, bends, site and on-site facilities, industrial buildings, tanks, process piping, etc., and preparation of cartographic materials to ensure prevention and organization of emergency. Methods: decoding of aerospace images of pipeline systems, analysis of space survey materials, data from unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, studying the possibilities of technologies of geoinformation mapping, computer modeling of the state of natural-anthropogenic complexes. Results. The authors have analyzed the regulatory documents that determine the composition of the information necessary for formation of GIS thematic layers on the state of environmental components and the dynamics of natural processes along the routes of pipeline systems. The modules of the information system concentrate data on the disturbance and pollution of the environment, allowing you to create maps of man-made impact scenarios and formulate recommendations for assessing the state and reducing negative consequences. The work shown that the data of remote sensing of the Earth with different spatial resolutions, unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, accurate geodetic reference make it possible to form arrays of geospatial data required for modeling. The environmental safety of hydrocarbon transport is ensured by modeling the development of natural processes that have negative impact on the objects of the pipeline system. For example, when pipeline sections are flooded during floods, as well as when oil and petroleum products enter watercourses, it is necessary to use high-precision digital terrain models. It is proposed to include modules in system that support the analysis of observational data and facilitate decision-making depending on the scenarios of process dynamics, including in the case of emergency oil spills. Conclusions. The significance of the work performed is to develop a methodology for solving a number of issues that contribute to decision-making to minimize the risk of possible accidents during the operation of pipeline systems. The practical value of the proposed technology for collecting and processing primary information for filling databases of geoinformation systems is that it allows you to obtain information sufficient for decision-making in preparation of plans for preventive measures and the elimination of emergency oil spills and the organization of emergency recovery operations. © 2021 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

"Climate Change Patterns Of Wild Blueberry Fields In Downeast, Maine Over The Past 40 Years","Maine, USA is the largest producer of wild blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), an important native North American fruit crop. Blueberry fields are mainly distributed in coastal glacial outwash plains which might not experience the same climate change patterns as the whole region. It is important to analyze the climate change patterns of wild blueberry fields and determine how they affect crop health so fields can be managed more efficiently under climate change. Trends in the maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min) and average (T-avg) temperatures, total precipitation (P-total), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were evaluated for 26 wild blueberry fields in Downeast Maine during the growing season (May-September) over the past 40 years. The effects of these climate variables on the Maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVImax) were evaluated using Remote Sensing products and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. We found differences in the increase in growing season T-max, T-min, T-avg, and P-total between those fields and the overall spatial average for the region (state of Maine), as well as among the blueberry fields. The maximum, minimum, and average temperatures of the studied 26 wild blueberry fields in Downeast, Maine showed higher rates of increase than those of the entire region during the last 40 years. Fields closer to the coast showed higher rates of warming compared with the fields more distant from the coast. Consequently, PET has been also increasing in wild blueberry fields, with those at higher elevations showing lower increasing rates. Optimum climatic conditions (threshold values) during the growing season were explored based on observed significant quadratic relationships between the climate variables (T-max and P-total), PET, and EVImax for those fields. An optimum T-max and PET for EVImax at 22.4 degrees C and 145 mm/month suggest potential negative effects of further warming and increasing PET on crop health and productivity. These climate change patterns and associated physiological relationships, as well as threshold values, could provide important information for the planning and development of optimal management techniques for wild blueberry fields experiencing climate change.",2021,"{""Drummond, Francis"",""Tasnim, Rafa"",""Zhang, Yong-Jiang""}",10.3390/w13050594,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Stand Delineation And Composition Estimation Using Semi-Automated Individual Tree Crown Analysis,"Stand delineation and species composition estimation are cornerstones of forest inventory mapping and key elements to forest management decision making. Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions. High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25%. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20%, but a few were up to 30%. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Waterbody Extraction From Sar Imagery Based On Improved Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion And Maximum Between-Cluster Variance,"The use of remote sensing technology to obtain surface waterbody information is of great significance for water resource investigation, natural disaster assessment, watershed planning, and ecological environment monitoring. As a reliable data source for large- scale ground monitoring, SAR imaging has unique advantages that optical remote sensing systems of all- weather, all- weather, and wide coverage do not have, and has been widely used in waterbody mapping. However, due to the influence of speckle noise of SAR imagery, existing methods for waterbody mapping are difficult to extract the complex and fine natural water structures from SAR imagery quickly and accurately. In this paper, a new waterbody extraction method for SAR imagery based on improved speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion and maximum between-cluster variance was proposed. First, the SAR imagery were filtered by improved speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion. The iterative process was adaptively controlled by calculating the average structural similarity between imagery in the iterative filtering process, so that the fine edges and texture structure could be preserved simultaneously. Then, based on the criterion of maximum variance between classes, the threshold value was determined adaptively, and the binary segmentation of the filtered image was conducted. In the binarized segmentation result, connected foreground regions composed of the pixel points that have same intensity values and adjoin to each other spatially, are searched. In so doing, each connected region formed an identified block. By obtaining geometric parameters of these blocks, the false segmentation of the imagery was eliminated, and real waterbody areas were precisely identified based on the SAR imagery. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, water boundaries extracted by this method were on manually drawn waterbody boundaries. Results of comparing the two methods show that they are pretty consistent with each other. Meanwhile, the results of our proposed method were compared with the results of three other kinds of water extraction algorithms commonly used for SAR imagery, in terms of the visual level, extraction accuracy, and running time. The running time of the proposed method meets the requirement of real-time application. The overlap degree of the extracted boundary in two pixels rating areas has reached 80%, which is obviously superior to other methods and the extraction results of the proposed method are also more significant in visual aspects such as boundary and detail information. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows the superiority of our proposed method. © 2019, Science Press.

A New Remote-Sensing-Based Indicator For Integrating Quantity And Quality Attributes To Assess The Dynamics Of Ecosystem Assets,"Ecological benefits provided by ecosystem assets play an important role in improving human wellbeing. However, there are few feasible methods to combine data on the quantity and quality of ecosystem assets to describe their state and trend. Here, we developed a new remote-sensing-based indicator by synthesizing ecosystem asset quantity and quality data for effective assessment at a regional or national scale. The new indicator includes a typological ecosystem asset index (TEAI) (e.g., forest ecosystem asset index) and an integrated ecosystem asset index (IEAI). The TEAI and IEAI can be used to assess the state and trend of a specific ecosystem or set of regional ecosystems, respectively. We applied the new indicator in the context of ecological protection policy in the Three-Rivers Source Region (TRSR), a region known as the 'Chinese water tower'. From 2000 to 2015, the IEAI increased by 4.02\% due to an increase in the ecosystem asset area (0.2\%) and the ecosystem asset quality (0.66\% and 0.02\% increases in excellent and good level ecosystem assets, respectively). The implementation of ecological protection and ecological restoration programs was the main direct driver of regional ecological asset improvement. Our results suggest the new indicator is feasible for quickly and accurately evaluating the state and trend of ecosystem assets and can be used to guide ecosystem management at a large regional scale.

"Hybrid Bermudagrass And Tall Fescue Turfgrass Irrigation In Central California: Ii. Assessment Of Ndvi, Cwsi, And Canopy Temperature Dynamics","As the drought conditions persist in California and water continues to become less available, the development of methods to reduce water inputs is extremely important. Therefore, improving irrigation water use efficiency and developing water conservation strategies is crucial for maintaining urban green infrastructure. This two-year field irrigation project (2018-2019) focused on the application of optical and thermal remote sensing for turfgrass irrigation management in central California. We monitored the response of hybrid bermudagrass and tall fescue to varying irrigation treatments, including irrigation levels (percentages of reference evapotranspiration, ETo) and irrigation frequency. The ground-based remote sensing data included NDVI and canopy temperature, which was subsequently used to calculate the crop water stress index (CWSI). The measurements were done within two hours of solar noon under cloud-free conditions. The NDVI and canopy temperature data were collected 21 times in 2018 and 10 times in 2019. For the tall fescue, a strong relationship was observed between NDVI and visual rating (VR) values in both 2018 (r = 0.92) and 2019 (r = 0.83). For the hybrid bermudagrass, there was no correlation in 2018 and a moderate correlation (r = 0.72) in 2019. There was a moderate correlation of 0.64 and 0.88 in 2018 and 2019 between tall fescue canopy minus air temperature difference (dt) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for the lower CWSI baseline. The correlation between hybrid bermudagrass dt and VPD for the lower baseline was 0.69 in 2018 and 0.64 in 2019. Irrigation levels significantly impacted tall fescue canopy temperature but showed no significant effect on hybrid bermudagrass canopy temperature. For the same irrigation levels, increasing irrigation frequency slightly but consistently decreased canopy temperature without compromising the turfgrass quality. The empirical CWSI values violated the minimum expected value (of 0) 38\% of the time. Our results suggest NDVI thresholds of 0.6-0.65 for tall fescue and 0.5 for hybrid bermudagrass to maintain acceptable quality in the central California region. Further investigation is needed to verify the thresholds obtained in this study, particularly for hybrid bermudagrass, as the recommendation is only based on 2019 data. No CWSI threshold was determined to maintain turf quality in the acceptable range because of the high variability of CWSI values over time and their low correlation with VR values.",2021,"{""Haghverdi, Amir"",""Reiter, Maggie"",""Sapkota, Anish"",""Singh, Amninder""}",10.3390/agronomy11091733,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Use Of Satellite Remote Sensing As A Monitoring Tool For Land And Water Resources Development Activities In An Indian Tropical Site,"With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016–2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10661-018-6770-8,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Nineteenth-Century Land-Use Legacies Affect Contemporary Land Abandonment In The Carpathians,"Historical land use may shape landscapes for centuries into the future, but it remains unclear how much land-use legacies affect contemporary land use. Knowing for how long and how strongly land-use legacies affect agricultural systems is important for contemporary land-use planning and conservation. We assessed the effect of nineteenth-century agricultural legacies for contemporary agricultural abandonment by integrating historic maps and satellite imagery in the Carpathian region. We modeled the choice of agricultural land, and the legacies of Habsburg and Socialist regimes, while controlling for agro-ecological, accessibility and sociopolitical variation. Farming during the Habsburg era was concentrated in agro-ecologically suitable areas, but socialist agricultural expansion occurred mostly in less suitable areas, leading to subsequent abandonment. In addition, our results showed that historic land use affected abandonment even 100 years later. Although legacies diminished over time, their effects were amplified when political transformations occurred, likely due to land tenure systems, land owner attitudes, cultural values and differences in land improvement over time. Taken together, land-use legacies and shifts in political systems can constrain current land management and possible future land-use options, suggesting that contemporary land-use decisions can affect future land use for decades and even centuries.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10113-016-1097-x,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
An Intelligent Hot-Desking Model Harnessing The Power Of Occupancy Sensing Data,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to harness occupancy sensing in a commercial hot-desking environment. Hot-desking is a method of office resource management designed to reduce the real estate costs of professional practices. However, the shortcoming is often in the suitability and appropriateness of allocated work environments. The Internet of Things could produce new data sets in the office at a resolution, speed and validity of which that they could be factored into desk-allocation, distributing seats based on appropriate noise levels, stay length, equipment requirements, previous presence and proximity to others working on the same project, among many others. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilises primary data from a commercial office environment in Central London (numerical building system data and semi-structured interviews) to feed a discrete events simulator. To test the hypothesis, the authors look at the potential for intelligent hot-desking to use ""work type"" data to improve the distribution of individuals in the office, increasing productivity through the creation of positive ""work type environments"" - where those working on specific tasks perform better when grouped with others doing the same task. The simulation runs for a typical work day, and the authors compare the intelligent hot-desking arrangement to a base case. Findings - The study shows that sensor data can be used for desk allocation in a hot-desking environment utilising activity-based working, with results that outweigh the costs of occupancy detection. The authors are not only able to optimise desk utilisation based on quality occupancy data but also demonstrate how overall productivity increases as individuals are allocated desks of their preference as much as possible among other enabling optimisations that can be applied. Moreover, the authors explore how an increase in occupancy data collection in the private sector could have key advantages for the business as an organization and the city as a whole. Research limitations/implications - The research explores only one possible incarnation of intelligent hot-desking, and the authors presume that all data have already been collected, and while not insurmountable, they do not discuss the technical or cultural difficulties to this end. Furthermore, final examination of the productivity benefit - because of the difficulty in defining and measuring the concept - is exploratory rather than definitive. This research suggests that not only human-centric smart building research should be prioritised over energy or space-based themes but also large-scale private sector collection of occupancy data may be imminent, and its potential should be examined. Practical implications - Findings strongly suggest that the hot-desking may cost more in lost productivity than it gains in reduced rental costs and as such many commercial offices should revaluate the transition, particularly with a view to facilitate intelligent hot-desking. Companies should begin to think strategically about the wider benefits of collecting occupancy data across their real estate portfolio, rather than reviewing use cases in silos. Finally, cities should consider scenarios of widespread collection of occupancy data in the private sector, examining the value these data have to city systems such as transport, and how the city might procure it for these ends. Social implications - This paper raises positive and negative social concerns. The value in occupancy data suggested herein, bringing with it the implication it should be collected en mass, has a noted concern that this brings privacy concerns. As such, policy and regulation should heed that current standards should be reviewed to ensure they are sufficient to protect those in offices from being unfairly discriminated, spied or exploited through occupancy data. However, the improved use of occupancy data improving workplaces could indeed make them more enjoyable places to work, and have the potential to become a staple in company's corporate social responsibility policies. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for better understanding the specific uses of occupancy data in the smart building mantra. Several sources suggest the current research focus on energy and rental costs is misguided when the holistic cost of an office is considered, and concepts related to staff although less understood - may have an order of magnitude bigger impact. This research supports this hypothesis through the example of intelligent hot-desking. The value of this paper lies in redirecting industry and research towards the considering occupancy data in smart building uses cases including - but not limited to-intelligent hot-desking.",NA,NA,10.1108/f-01-2016-0014,{spurious},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Floral Abundance And Richness Drive Beneficial Arthropod Conservation And Biological Control On Golf Courses,"Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use, which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the biological control services of flying natural enemies and few investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50\% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of turfgrass pests.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11252-019-00907-0,{spurious},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Combining Hyper-Resolution Land Surface Modeling With Smap Brightness Temperatures To Obtain 30-M Soil Moisture Estimates,"Accurate and detailed soil moisture information is essential for, among other things, irrigation, drought and flood prediction, water resources management, and field-scale (i.e., tens of m) decision making. Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales. Our results highlight the value of hyper-resolution modeling to bridge the gap between coarse-scale satellite retrievals and field-scale hydrological applications.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111740,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Tephra Clean-Up After The 2015 Eruption Of Calbuco Volcano, Chile: A Quantitative Geospatial Assessment In Four Communities","Reliable methods for volcanic impact and risk assessments are essential. They provide constructive information to emergency and disaster managers, critical infrastructure providers, the insurance industry, and wider society. Post-eruption clean-up of tephra deposits is a prevalent and expensive (time and resource) activity which is often not planned for. Here, we present an overview of the clean-up efforts undertaken in four communities after the VEI 4 eruption of Calbuco volcano in 2015. We narratively reconstruct clean-up efforts in Ensenada (Chile), Junín de los Andes (Argentina), San Martín de los Andes (Argentina), and Villa La Angostura (Argentina) using semi-structured interviews, syn- and post-deposition photographs, pre- and post-event visual spectrum satellite imagery, and media reports. We compare these reconstructions with estimates based on a geospatial modelling approach adapted from Hayes et al. (Journal of Applied Volcanology 6:1; 2017). Specifically, we compare reported and geospatially derived estimates for volume of tephra removed, and clean-up operation duration. Our modelling approach performed well for Junín de los Andes but did not adequately capture volume and clean-up operation duration for the three remaining case study locations. We discuss several sources of uncertainty (including observational errors and natural variance of tephra deposit thickness), reported tephra removal volume estimates, clean-up methods, land use, and temporal evolution of clean-up operation demand. Our work demonstrates the utility of using simple geospatial data to develop assessments for tephra clean-up for use in response and recovery planning, and quantitative volcanic impact and risk assessments. © 2019 The Author(s).",NA,NA,10.1186/s13617-019-0087-3,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Environmental Impacts Of Urban Sprawl In Surat, Gujarat: An Examination Using Landsat Data","This study examines the environmental impacts of urban sprawl in Surat inner city in India. Urban sprawl is examined by studying land-use land-cover change from 1998 to 2016. Changes in spatial characteristics of urban land cover are further verified using Shannon's entropy. The impact of urban sprawl is examined by computing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) values. Land surface temperature (LST) is also calculated using thermal band of multi-temporal Landsat data. Regression analysis is used to calculate the correlation between LST and NDVI, NDWI and NDBI. The study showed a negative correlation between NDVI, NDWI and LST and a positive correlation between NDBI and LST. Urban areas in Surat have grown an approximately 60.41 sq.km, a 102\% increase while surface temperature in Surat inner city has risen by 5.1 degrees C during the study period. The study also showed that temperature increase was particularly pronounced throughout areas classified as urban and bare soil and showed an increasing trend in parts of the city with dense urban areas.",2022,"{""Mukherjee, Falguni""}",10.1007/s12524-022-01509-8,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Sar-Based Subsidence Monitoring And Assessment Of The Factors Involved In The Occurrence Of Subsidence, Lahore City","The judicious use and management of natural resources is vital to achieve sustainable development. Land and water are prime natural resources, and their depletion and degradation can lead to serious threats like land subsidence. Land subsidence is a phenomenon of the alteration of elevation at a point on the earth through the sinking of the surface. It occurs when the earth’s surface loses its support. The major causes of land subsidence include groundwater extraction, mining, construction overload, and other similar factors that increase pressure on the surface and eventually subsidize the land. Urban centers with excessive groundwater extraction and infra-structure development are at a high risk of subsidence. Lahore, the second-largest city in Pakistan, is undergoing an enormous increase in population density, uncontrolled urbanization with very large-scale construction projects, and intensive groundwater extraction which are responsible for subsidence directly or indirectly. Therefore, studies on groundwater status and unplanned urban appraisals have seriously urged monitoring of the subsidence in La-hore. Herein, we used freely available Sentinel-1 data for one year (from August 2018 to August 2019), with a high spatial and temporal resolution, to monitor subsidence in Lahore. The data were processed using the SNAP/StaMPS approach for Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI) analysis, which is an advanced InSAR technique. The displacement velocity map from InSAR processing shows a significant land deformation in the area with values ranging from −114 to 15 mm yr–1. Along with the Sentinel-1 data, we also used supplementary data obtained from various government agencies of Pakistan to study the land cover map, transportation network and waterways of Lahore, soil types, population density, and field points for assessing the results and understanding the roles of various factors in the occurrence of uplift or subsidence. A strong correlation was established between subsidence and various parameters such as groundwater extraction and lowering of the water table, soil type variations, land cover changes, surface water channels, and population density. The deformation map confirms the greatest subsidence in the central part of Lahore, while the uplift is observed in the less populated and rural areas situated near Ravi River. The land subsidence and uplift could be attributed to groundwater extraction and recharge through the canal system and the river, respectively. © 2022, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

"Predicting Occurrence, Abundance, And Fruiting Of A Cultural Keystone Species To Inform Landscape Values And Priority Sites For Habitat Enhancements","Environmental niche modeling is an increasingly common tool in conservation and management of non-timber species. In particular, models of species' habitats have been aided by new advances in remote sensing and it is now possible to relate forest structure variables to understory species at a relatively high resolution over large spatial scales. Here, we model landscape responses for a culturally-valued keystone shrub, velvet-leaf blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloidesMichaux), in northeast Alberta, Canada, to better understand the environmental factors promoting or limiting its occurrence, abundance, and fruit production, and to guide regional planning. Occurrence and abundance were measured at 845 and 335 sites, respectively, with both strongly related to land cover type and topo-edaphic factors. However, their influence varied widely, reflecting differences in the processes affecting occurrence and abundance. We then used airborne laser scanning (ALS) to characterize horizontal forest canopy cover for the study area, and related this and other geospatial variables to patterns in fruit production where we demonstrated a five-fold increase in fruit production from closed to open forest stands. We then simulated forest canopy thinning across the study area to identify places where gains in fruit production would be greatest following natural disturbance or directed management (e.g., thinning, prescribed burning). Finally, we suggest this approach could be used to identify sites for habitat enhancements to offset direct (land use change) or indirect (access) losses of resources in areas impacted with resource extraction activities, or simply to increase a culturally-valued resource through management.",NA,NA,10.3390/f11070783,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
4d-Trajectory Air Traffic Management: Are There 'Killer Apps'? - Part 2,"The USA and Europe are developing plans - NextGen and SESAR - to transform the processes of Air Traffic Management (ATM). These will improve safety and efficiency, and match predicted increases in air transportation demand. They use advanced networking technology updated with information from satellite navigation and digital non-voice communication. The strategic goal, envisaged for 15-20 years hence, is a new ATM paradigm. Aircraft would fly on Four-Dimensional (4D) trajectories, incorporating altitude, position, time, and other aircraft positions and vectors. This vision would involve extremely large investments from the airline industry and ATM service providers. Thus, development priorities need to be based on sound business cases. But will these necessarily lead to the strategic vision of a 4D-trajectory system? Will the changes in practice be limited to a series of short and medium term operational improvements rather than strategic improvements? So, are there 'Killer Apps' for 4D-trajectory ATM? 'Killer App(lication)s' is jargon for innovations so valuable that they prove the core value of some larger technology. Killer Apps generate high degrees of stakeholder technical and financial cooperation. Ironically, most past ATM Killer Apps have improved safety, e. g., modern radar data processing led to collision avoidance systems. The analysis here attempts to identify and then size potential 4D-trajectory ATM Killer Apps. The evidence for Killer Apps has to pass key tests. Killer Apps obviously have to offer enormous benefits to stakeholders in the context of the potential costs. The bulk of these benefits must not be obtainable through technologically 'cut down' non-4D-trajectory versions. Part 1 of this paper (Brooker, 2012a) sets out the framework for investigating these questions. Part 2 examines potential Killer Apps derived from improvements in Fuel Efficiency, Capacity and Cost.

Nest Site Selection And The Effects Of Land Use In A Multi-Scale Approach On The Distribution Of A Passerine In An Island Arid Environment,"We examine the predictive ability of habitat-species relationship models in island semi-desert environments using as model species the Canary Islands stonechat (Saxicola dacotiae), an endemic bird inhabiting the arid island of Fuerteventura. We investigated nest site selection and the effects of land use on its distribution in a multi-scale approach using nest positions obtained during three consecutive breeding seasons. We identified two environmental predictors, namely Tasseled cap 1 (a range value of land brightness) and slope, and three variables derived from human use (house densities, unpaved roads and fences) as the best predictors of occurrence of the species. Only slope had a positive and significant effect on stonechat occurrence; the rest being negative. Results were not restricted by the scale, indicating that design of special protection areas should be developed considering the landscape scale. Our results provide a robust prediction of the species distribution throughout Fuerteventura, demonstrating that our approach can also cope for the low vegetation signal within small arid regions such as islands. Future land use planning and management for the island should avoid the presence of negative impact elements such as opening new roads and new urbanisations in nearby habitats with the highest probabilities of species occurrence.

The Role Of Agroforestry In Restoring Brazil's Atlantic Forest: Opportunities And Challenges For Smallholder Farmers,"1. Restoring the degraded Atlantic Forest is one of the biggest conservation challenges in Brazil. In a biome with high human presence, understanding the potential for restoration approaches, such as agroforestry, to provide benefits to smallholder farmers and biodiversity is essential in developing equitable restoration strategies. 2. Smallholder or family farmers are essential to national food security, producing most fruit and vegetables consumed in Brazil. Their farms can also provide ecological stepping stones for biodiversity. To better understand their role in Atlantic Forest restoration, this study explores the use of agroforestry by smallholder farmers from the Movimento Sem Terra (MST), the Rural Landless Workers' Movement, in Pontal do Paranapanema. 3. We use quantitative and qualitative data to assess farmer perceptions of the measures which support agroforestry farming, barriers to implementation and its impact on indicators of wellbeing. We find agroforestry farmers report significant benefits in 8 of 18 tested indicators. Attitudes to agroforestry are varied, but common themes emerge including the high value of tree cover for shade and cooling effects, and the difficulties in selling agroforestry products. Our results show lack of policy support and initial investment needs are the biggest constraints to agroforestry, but opportunity cost is not considered a large barrier. 4. Tailored policies and financial measures are needed to integrate thousands of smallholder farmers into the Atlantic Forest restoration agenda, helping to reach biome restoration targets while supporting rural livelihoods and national food security. Further research is required into links between additional socio-economic and biogeographical variables and agroforestry uptake in the region.",2022,"{""Homewood, Katherine"",""Mills, Morena"",""Shennan-Farpon, Yara"",""Souza, Aline""}",10.1002/pan3.10297,"{""Movimento Sem Terra"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Model-Based Assessment Of The Pattern Differences And The Equity Of National Carbon Emissions In China During 2000-2010,"Land cover information of China was extracted using the supervised classification of remote sensing data and the carbon sink and carbon emissions of each province were calculated by combining the statistical data with the method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 listing. With the newly built 3E model, the three indexes of ESI (ecological support index), EDI (equitable distribution index) and EEI (economic efficiency index) were calculated and their spatial pattern characteristics and regional differences over time were analyzed. The research results indicated that as the forest coverage rate increased, the carbon sink of the ecosystem in China also increased. ESI in the central and western China was tending to decrease, while ESI in the eastern coast was growing. Although the EEI gap between eastern China and western China was large, their EDI value gap was becoming shrinking as the economic growth shifted towards the central China and western China. The 3E values which were calculated with the consideration of ecology, equity and efficiency for China's carbon emissions indicated that the carbon emissions in half provinces of China were in good conditions, with benign ecosystem circulation, fairness and high economic efficiency in the recent 11 years. These results could act as references for China's low carbon economic development and also could provide guidance for the spatial pattern planning of China's carbon emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban Green Accessibility Index: A Measure Of Pedestrian-Centered Accessibility To Every Green Point In An Urban Area,"Advancements in remote sensing techniques and urban data analysis tools have enabled the successful monitoring and detection of green spaces in a city. This study aims to develop an index called the urban green accessibility (UGA) index, which measures people's accessibility to green space and represents the citywide or local characteristics of the distribution pattern of green space. The index is defined as the sum of pedestrians' accessibility to all vegetation points, which consists of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with integration and choice values from angular segment analysis. In this study, the proposed index is tested with cases of New York, NY, and San Francisco, CA, in the US. The results reveal differences based on the significance of streets. When analysis ranges are on a neighborhood scale, a few hotspots appear in well-known green areas on commonly accessible streets and in local neighborhood parks on residential blocks. The appearance of high-accessibility points in low-NDVI areas implies the potential of the efficient and proper distribution of green spaces for pedestrians. The proposed measure is expected to help in planning and managing green areas in cities, taking people's accessibility and spatial relationships into consideration.",2020,"{""Cho, Hyemin"",""Jang, Kee Moon"",""Kim, Jaeman"",""Kim, Youngchul"",""Lee, Hye-Yeong""}",10.3390/ijgi9100586,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Investigation Of Potential Of Solar Photovoltaic System As An Alternative Electric Supply On The Tropical Island Of Mantanani Sabah Malaysia,"This article reports on the potential use of a photovoltaic solar system on Mantanani Island. This island has its attractions in terms of flora and fauna as well as the uniqueness of its local community. The electricity supply status of the island is minimal, and the local electricity provider only provides two units of electrical generator that only supply energy from 18:00 to 06:00. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that if the target resident can obtain a better electricity supply, they can generate higher income and improve their standard of living. This study aims to identify the status of solar energy sources, estimate the basic electrical load, and conduct a techno-economic analysis of homestay enterprises of residents. Geostationary satellite data on solar energy resources were gathered and analyzed using Solargis. The electricity load was calculated based on the daily routine activities of the residents and usage of primary electrical appliances. Techno-economic analysis was done by determining the key parameters to calculate the return on investment and payback period. The results showed that Mantanani Island had great potential for implementing a photovoltaic system, by the estimated value of the total annual solar energy and peak sun hour of 1.447 MWh/m(2)/y and 4.05 h, respectively. The variation in total monthly solar energy was minimal, with a range of only 61.3 Wh/m(2). The calculated electrical load was 7.454 kWh/d. The technoeconomic assessment showed that the return on investment was MYR 3600 per year. However, the value of the payback period varies according to the value of the cost of capital spent. Regarding the cost of capital of this study, the shortest and longest payback periods achievable were 2.78 and 13.89 years, respectively. This calculation is in line with a photovoltaic system with a capacity of 2.2 kWp.",2021,"{""Abd Hamid, Ag Sufiyan"",""Abd Rahman, Abu Bakar"",""Ibrahim, Adnan"",""Jamain, Zuhair"",""Makmud, Mohamad Zul Hilmey""}",10.3390/su132212432,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Porto Alegre 2006: Called To Be The One Church: Ecumenism Beyond Its Crisis?,"From 9-23 February 2006 the World Council of Churches held its 9th Assembly in Porto Alegre, Brasil with the theme God, in your grace, transform the world.

The Assembly, though, became a sign of hope beyond the ecumenical crisis. Its reflections and proposals on Globalisation and economic injustice, on Christian identity and religious plurality and on Church Unity and the Mission of the Church demonstrate a matured ecumenical and ecclesiological awareness, strengthened by a new method of decision-making by consensus. The document Called to be the one Church might be seen as the constitutional basis for a reconfiguration of the ecumenical movement and as a refinement of the Toronto Declaration of 1950.

Hydrological Simulation Using Trmm And Chirps Precipitation Estimates In The Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin,"Satellite-based products with high spatial and temporal resolution provide useful precipitation information for data-sparse or ungauged large-scale watersheds. In the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, rainfall stations are sparse and unevenly distributed, and the transboundary characteristic makes the collection of precipitation data more difficult, which has restricted hydrological processes simulation. In this study, daily precipitation data from four datasets (gauge observations, inverse distance weighted (IDW) data, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimates, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) estimates), were applied to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and then their capability for hydrological simulation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin were examined. TRMM and CHIRPS data showed good performances on precipitation estimation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, with the better performance for TRMM product. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of gauge, IDW, TRMM, and CHIRPS simulations during the calibration period were 0.87, 0.86, 0.95, and 0.93 for monthly flow, respectively, and those for daily flow were 0.75, 0.77, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively. TRMM and CHIRPS data were superior to rain gauge and IDW data for driving the hydrological model, and TRMM data produced the best simulation performance. Satellite-based precipitation estimates could be suitable data sources when simulating hydrological processes for large data-poor or ungauged watersheds, especially in international river basins for which precipitation observations are difficult to collect. CHIRPS data provide long precipitation time series from 1981 to near present and thus could be used as an alternative precipitation input for hydrological simulation, especially for the period without TRMM data. For satellite-based precipitation products, the differences in the occurrence frequencies and amounts of precipitation with different intensities would affect simulation results of water balance components, which should be comprehensively considered in water resources estimation and planning.",2019,"{""He, Daming"",""Ji, Xuan"",""Li, Yungang"",""Luo, Xian"",""Wu, Wenqi""}",10.1007/s11769-019-1014-6,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Clinical Research In Telemedicine: Evaluation Of The Medical Service To Patients,"Telemedicine is a remote medical practice which uses tools related to information and communication technologies (ICT). Since July 21, 2009, French law permits this new medical practice and the decree of October 19, 2010, indicates the main procedures (tele-consultation, tele-expertise, medical tele-surveillance, medical tele-assistance, tele-advice from the hospital call center) and the conditions of their implementation. Clinical research is the practice of clinical trials which have the aim of evaluating the safety and efficacy of a diagnostic method or a new treatment. Clinical research is the main purpose of the National Association of Telemedicine (ANTEL) and of its new official journal European Research in Telemedicine. This editorial is opening the first issue of our journal. Several examples can illustrate the importance of clinical research in telemedicine. In type 1 diabetes, after the first discordant results due to insufficient or weak methodologies, the French study TeleDiab 1 brought for the first time a clinical improvement over 6 months in patients followed-up remotely by Diabeo software and teleconsultation. The main medical service to patients was a decrease of complication risks due to a significant decrease of HbA1c. Nevertheless, the encouraging results of this pilot study need confirmation over a longer period (the TELESAGE study over two years). In chronic heart failure, the first results of two meta-analyses showed a significant 30% reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, these results were not confirmed by two, more recent, prospective and randomised studies. Most authors think that it is necessary to define several subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure in order to recognize patient subgroups who could benefit from telemedicine at home. The medical service to stroke patients brought by telemedicine is not open to debate. Telestroke allows patients away from neurology centres to benefit from emergency thrombolysis (less than 4 h 30 min after the first signs) treatment that can allow the total or partial regression of a neurological deficit. Other telemedicine applications have been able to demonstrate a medical service to patients, for example remote blood pressure self-monitoring at home in hypertensive patients, live interactive teledermatology, teledialysis by peritoneal dialysis at home or by haemodialysis by a remote satellite unit, etc. Teleradiology brings a medical service to patients if it is carried out according to international or national guidelines. Many other applications of telemedicine may be the subject of clinical research such as telegeriatry, tele-psychiatry, tele-surgery, tele-rhumatology, tele-obstetric, tele-pathology, etc.). Telemedicine practice can have a significant economical impact, particularly due to reductions in hospitalisation numbers. Risk factors due to telemedicine are beginning to be known. Clinical research on the medical service to patients followed-up by telemedicine can prevent risks. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",2012,"{""Simon, P.""}",10.1016/j.eurtel.2012.02.005,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Adjoint Inverse Modeling Of NoX Emissions Over Eastern China Using Satellite Observations Of No2 Vertical Column Densities,"A four-dimensional variational data assimilation system for optimization of NOx emissions (RC4-NOx) was developed. A parameterized NOx chemistry scheme was introduced into the RC4-NOx system, and key parameters such as chemical production and loss terms of NOx were calculated in advance using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. RC4-NOx was applied to optimize NOx emissions over eastern China (EC) in July 1996,1999, and 2002 using Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite observations of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and a priori emissions from the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS). After assimilation, RC4-NOx generally reproduced the spatial distribution, regional averaged values, and time evolution of GOME NO2 VCDs. Over EC, a priori emissions were reduced by 20\% in 1996 and by 8\% in 1999, whereas a posteriori emissions were almost the same as a priori emissions in 2002. A priori emissions in the Beijing region were reduced by optimization over the whole simulation period. A posteriori emissions over the Yangtze Delta were larger than a priori emissions in 2002, although they were smaller in both 1996 and 1999. As in other areas, a priori emissions over the North China Plain were reduced in 1996; but those over the eastern part of the plain were increased in 1999, and the area of increased emissions moved slightly westward in 2002. In each region, the growth rates of a posteriori emissions during both 1996-1999 and 1999-2002 became generally larger than those of a priori emissions, and the trends of a posteriori emissions became similar to those of GOME NO2 VCDs. Our inverse modeling analysis indicates that the rate of increase of NO, emissions over EC from 1996 to 2002 was much larger for a posteriori emissions (49\%) than for a priori emissions (19\%).

Node-Based Optimization Of Gnss Tomography With A Minimum Bounding Box Algorithm,"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) tomography plays an important role in the monitoring and tracking of the tropospheric water vapor. In this study, a new approach for improving the node-based GNSS tomography is proposed, which makes a trade-off between the real observed region and the complexity of the discretization of the tomographic region. To obtain dynamically the approximate observed region, the convex hull algorithm and minimum bounding box algorithm are used at each tomographic epoch. This new approach can dynamically define the tomographic model for all types of study areas based on the GNSS data. The performance of the new approach is tested by comparing it against the common node-based GNSS tomographic approach. Test data in May 2015 are obtained from the Hong Kong GNSS network to build the tomographic models and the radiosonde data as a reference are used for validating the quality of the new approach. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square errors of the new approach, in most cases, have a 38 percent improvement and the values of standard deviation reduce to over 43 percent compared with the common approach. The results indicate that the new approach is applicable to the node-based GNSS tomography. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,"{""Ding, N."",""Holden, L."",""Liu, X."",""Wang, X."",""Wang, Y."",""Wu, S."",""Yan, X."",""Zhang, K."",""Zhang, S."",""Zhang, W."",""Zhang, Y.""}",10.3390/rs12172744,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"A Study On Avalanche-Triggering Factors And Activity Characteristics In Aerxiangou, West Tianshan Mountains, China","Through analyzing the triggering factors and activity characteristics of avalanches in Aerxiangou in the Western Tianshan Mountains, the formation and disaster-causing process of avalanches were studied to provide theoretical support and a scientific basis for avalanche disaster prevention. In this paper, based on remote sensing interpretation and field investigation, a spatial distribution map of avalanches was established, and the induced and triggering factors in disaster-prone environments were analyzed using the certainty factor model. The degree of influence (E) of the disaster-causing factors on avalanche triggering was quantified, and the main control conditions conducive to avalanche occurrence in different periods were obtained. The RAMMS-avalanche model was used to analyze the activity characteristics at points where multiple avalanches occurred. Research results: (1) The E values of the average temperature, average snowfall, and surface roughness in February were significantly higher than those of other hazard-causing factors, reaching 1.83 and 1.71, respectively, indicating strong control. The E values of the surface cutting degree, average temperature, and average snow depth in March were all higher than 1.8, indicating that these control factors were more prominent than the other factors. In contrast, there were four hazard-causing factors with E values higher than 1.5 in April: the mean temperature, slope, surface roughness, and mean wind speed, with clear control. (2) Under the influence of the different hazard-causing factors, the types of avalanches from February–April mainly included new full-layer avalanches, surface avalanches, and full-layer wet avalanches. (3) In the RAMMS-avalanche simulation test, considering the deposition effect, compared to the previous avalanche movement path, the secondary avalanche flow accumulation area impact range changes were slight, while the movement area within the avalanche path changes was large, as were the different categories of avalanches and their different movement characteristic values. Overall, wet snow avalanches are more hazardous, and the impact force is larger. The new snow avalanches start in a short period, the sliding rate is fast, and the avalanche sliding surface (full-snow surface and face-snow) of the difference is mainly manifested in the differences in the value of the flow height. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,"{""Hu, C."",""Liu, J."",""Sun, X."",""Wang, B."",""Yang, Z."",""Yao, S."",""Zhang, T.""}",10.3390/atmos14091439,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Current Value Of Historical And Ongoing Surveillance For Disease Freedom: Surveillance For Bovine Johne's Disease In Western Australia,"'Confidence' in freedom from disease is generally derived from multiple sources of varied surveillance information, and typically this surveillance evidence has been accumulated over time. In the state of Western Australia (WA) the main surveillance evidence supporting Free Zone status in the national bovine Johne's disease (BJD) program comprises periodic surveys and the ongoing clinical diagnostic system. This paper illustrates a simple approach to current valuation of historical surveillance information, based on the calculated sensitivity of the surveillance processes, the time elapsed since the data were accumulated, and the probability of new introduction of disease into the population during that elapsed time. Surveillance system components (SSCs) contributing to the overall sensitivity of the surveillance system were the clinical diagnostic system and periodic targeted surveys. Sensitivity of each component was estimated using a stochastic scenario tree model of the surveillance process as implemented. Probability of introduction of BJD into WA during each time period was estimated retrospectively from a stochastic import risk analysis model applied to actual cattle importation data. The probability that the WA cattle population was free from infection (at design prevalences of 0.2% of herds and 2% of animals within an infected herd) was estimated following each of 11 years, giving a median probability that the State was free of BJD (at these design prevalences) at the end of 2005 of 0.89.

These efforts produced a diverse set of atmospheric data from airborne, surface-based, and satellite platforms. Organizers of the experiments, including the World Meteorological Organization, quickly recognized the value of collecting all data into a central archive. This paper describes the development of that archive. Basic requirements for the archive were that it contain all pertinent datasets, including detailed documentation about each, and provide easy access to all interested researchers. The requirements were met by developing a database management system that contains a catalog of the data inventory and a facility to order specific datasets. A graphical user interface provides access to the database. In addition to the basic capability of searching the data inventory, the system has a number of other features, including a visual catalog of satellite images, a bibliography of relevant publications, and an extensive metadata collection describing the datasets. The system is accessible from the Internet or telephone/modem from a variety of terminal types, making it available to virtually anyone with a computer. Researchers from around the world have successfully used the system.",NA,NA,10.1175/1520-0477(1994)075<1813:doadms>2.0.co;2,"{""value of a database""}",excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
"Valuing The Accessibility Of Green Spaces In The Housing Market: A Spatial Hedonic Analysis In Shanghai, China","As a crucial determinant of urban livability, the importance of access to high-quality green spaces has long been recognized for achieving sustainable urbanization. In urban areas, higher values are usually placed in residential properties with higher accessibility to green spaces. Using housing transaction data from as many as 3388 residential communities in Shanghai coupled with high-resolution satellite data of urban green spaces, we comprehensively examine the relationship between residential property values and the accessibility of both community-owned and public green spaces. We find, in instrumental-variable estimations, that: (1) home prices, on average, increase by 0.17\% if the overall green space accessibility rises by 1\%; and that (2) a 1\% increase in the green ratio within a community raises property values by 0.46\%. Moreover, the number of accessible green spaces, area of accessible green spaces, and distance to the nearest green spaces have positive impacts on home values separately. We also find strong spatial dependence in urban green spaces and unobserved price determinants, as well as heterogeneity by location, property value, and housing type. Our empirical findings provide valuable guidance for real estate developers and local governments in valuing environmental amenities and urban planning in the context of a residential housing market.",2023,"{""Ben, Shenglin"",""Lu, Jiajun"",""Wang, Renfeng"",""Zhu, He""}",10.3390/land12091660,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
‘My Own Slender Remarks’: Global Networks Of Slavery And Sociability In Mary Ann Parker’s Voyage To New South Wales (1795),"The long history of Terra Australis describes a space sketched in lines of speculation, ambition and multiple desire. Even at the end of the eighteenth century – after Cook’s exemplary curiosity and minute mapping produced the fabled space of Terra Australis as a place of English settlement and incarceration – knowledge of the new continent of Australia remained provisional and speculative. As was the case in its earliest incarnations, the representation of Terra Australis responds to contemporary preoccupations and imaginative investments, in this case the intermeshing late eighteenth-century realities of slavery, anti-slavery, trade, transportation and colonialism. Mary Ann Parker’s account of Australia shortly after European settlement reveals a network of such influences at work in her encounters with the landscape and culture of the new settlement. The Voyage Around the World (1795) positions Port Jackson at its narrative centre, but Parker’s perception of New South Wales is shaped by a broader circulation of people, information and ideas through the Atlantic. Parker’s approach to the colonial project at New South Wales is formed through anterior networks of hospitality and commerce connecting trading communities and colonial settlements along global travel routes. These material networks provide powerful cultural and ideological models for the voyageuse: the mediating values of Parker’s text are the forms of politeness and global hospitality she enjoys in the West Indies and the Cape, complicated by the ethical dilemmas of enforced labour. © Anne M.

A Novel Modelling Approach To The Identification Of Optimum Sites For The Placement Of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (Otec) Power Plant: Application To The Tropical Island Climate Of Mauritius,"The geographical location of Mauritius near the warm tropical waters of the Indian Ocean coupled to the vast exclusive economic zone approximating 2.3 million square kilometers, encourage the promotion of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems. Technological advancements have enabled offshore structures to pump the cold water lying at 1000m depth in the seawater column to the surface, and through the temperature difference set up with the warm surface layer, drives a turbine and generates electricity. In this study, a model has been developed to compute the temperature difference between the deep (1000m) and surface (20m) seawater layers around Mauritius. An algorithm has been implemented to determine the net power generated from a proposed OTEC power plant, acquired through the processing of sea surface temperature satellite images, at a resolution of 1 km. The spatial and temporal variations of the net power generated has been observed by splitting the annual data into four monsoonal time frames. Results show that the south-western region of Mauritius possesses high OTEC resources, with annual mean daily net power generation capacity of about 95MW, representing about 20\% of the peak power demand of the island. Moreover, the bathymetry of the southern region is propitious due to deep cold water availability at a proximity of less than 5km from the coastline. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the OTEC system are found to be 1.9 and 22.8\%, respectively. A cost-benefit analysis indicates that profits of the order of 4.5 times the initial investment can be generated.",2018,"{""Doorga, Jay Rovisham Singh"",""Gooroochurn, Oomarsing"",""Motah, Beenesh Anand"",""Ramchandur, Vimal"",""Sunassee, Shane""}",10.1007/s40095-018-0278-4,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Wheat Yield Predictions At A County And Field Scale With Deep Learning, Machine Learning, And Google Earth Engine","To meet the challenges of climate change, increasing population and food demand, a timely, accurate and reliable estimation of crop yield at a large scale is more imperative than ever for crop management, food security evaluation, food trade and policy-making. In this study, taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example, we compared a traditional machine learning method (random forest, RF) and three deep learning (DL) models, including DNN (deep neural networks), 1D-CNN (1D convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks) to predict crop yields by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data. The results showed that all four models could capture winter wheat yield variations in all the county-years, with R-2 of recorded and simulated yields ranging from 0.83 to 0.90 and RMSE ranging from 561.18 to 959.62 kg/ha. They all performed well for winter wheat yield prediction at a county level from 2011 to 2015, with mean R-2 >= 0.85 and RMSE <= 768 kg/ha. At a field level, the spatial pattern of estimated winter wheat yield could capture the spatial heterogeneity and yield differences between individual fields across a county fairly well. However, only the DNN and RF models had relatively good performance at the field level, with mean R2 values of 0.71, 0.66 and RMSE values of 1127 kg/ha and 956 kg/ha, respectively. The model comparisons showed that the performance of RF was not always worse than DL at both the county and field levels. Our findings demonstrated a scalable, simple and inexpensive framework for estimating crop yields at various scales in a timely manner and with reliable accuracy, which has important implications for crop yield forecasting, agricultural disaster monitoring, food trade policy, and food security warning.",2021,"{""Cao, Juan"",""Li, Ziyue"",""Luo, Yuchuan"",""Tao, Fulu"",""Zhang, Jing"",""Zhang, Liangliang"",""Zhang, Zhao""}",10.1016/j.eja.2020.126204,"{""algorithm not data""}",excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Using Deep Ensemble Forest For High-Resolution Mapping Of Pm2.5 From Modis Maiac Aod In Tehran, Iran","High-resolution mapping of PM2.5 concentration over Tehran city is challenging because of the complicated behavior of numerous sources of pollution and the insufficient number of ground air quality monitoring stations. Alternatively, high-resolution satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data can be employed for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5. For this purpose, different data-driven methods have been used in the literature. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated their ability to estimate PM2.5 from AOD data. However, these methods have several weaknesses in solving the problem of estimating PM2.5 from satellite AOD data. In this paper, the potential of the deep ensemble forest method for estimating the PM2.5 concentration from AOD data was evaluated. The results showed that the deep ensemble forest method with R-2 = 0.74 gives a higher accuracy of PM2.5 estimation than deep learning methods ( R-2 = 0.67 ) as well as classic data-driven methods such as random forest ( R-2 = 0.68 ). Additionally, the estimated values of PM2.5 using the deep ensemble forest algorithm were used along with ground data to generate a high-resolution map of PM2.5. Evaluation of produced PM2.5 map revealed the good performance of the deep ensemble forest for modeling the variation of PM2.5 in the city of Tehran.",2023,"{""Bagheri, Hossein""}",10.1007/s10661-023-10951-1,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Trends Of Greening And Browning In Terrestrial Vegetation In China From 2000 To 2020,"Terrestrial vegetation condition is altering generally as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activity during the past few decades. To reveal the impact of long-term climate factors and artificial protection on multiple vegetation types, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of vegetation greening and browning and the effect of national ecological restoration programs. In this study, we established a persistent vegetation change index (P-value) to characterize greening (restoration) and browning (degradation) in China in 2000-2020. Firstly, we generated annual time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS product by averaging the monthly maximum NDVI values for each year. Secondly, we calculated the Pvalue to investigate the continuous change in vegetation state by incremental time interval. Finally, patterns and trends of greening and browning in forests, shrublands, and grasslands were quantified and mapped at pixel and sample point levels. The findings of our study revealed that Chinese wild vegetated lands greened up by -3.4 x 104 km2 (25\%) and turned brown in -1.6 x 104 km2 (11\%) between 2000 and 2020. Net greening was detected in all biomes, most conspicuously in several ecological program regions in northern China. The NDVI time-series data in 31\% of field plots showed a consistent result, 11\% of field plots showed a browning trend, and 58\% of field plots showed a stable state. These results indicated a synergistic effect on forests, shrublands, and grasslands, but with regional variations attributed to differences in precipitation abundance, the implementation of positive ecological programs by the government and negative human activities. Additionally, these findings provide valuable insight into large-scale terrestrial vegetation transitions and have practical applications for decision-making and policy development in the assessment and restoration of ecosystems aimed at reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and conserving water resources in China.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110587,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Testing The Utility Of The Blue Spectral Region In Burned Area Mapping: Insights From Savanna Wildfires,"Monitoring ecosystem events such as wildfires with remote sensing is fundamental to natural resources management. However, precisely delineating burned areas with remote sensing remains a challenge for post-fire ecological assessment. Burned area mapping methods with spectral indices are affected by several interferences such as soil background, water surfaces and atmospheric effects. In this study, we test the applicability of a normalized difference spectral index with the shortwave infrared and blue spectral bands in accurately mapping burned areas. The spectral index was tested in two study sites and compared to six spectral indices commonly used in burned area mapping. Random forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify the spectral indices and map burned areas. Although the True Skill Statistic (TSS) was relatively low, we found out that the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and Normalized Burned Index (NBI) performed better than all the other spectral indices considered in the two study sites. The Burned Area Index (BAI) was the third highest performing spectral index. OSAVI and NBI performed well in the study sites plausibly because they were adjusted for soil effects and the blue spectral band was included to account for atmospheric effects. Our results indicate the need to adjust spectral indices for soil, water and atmospheric effects when using them for burned area mapping. The study also adds rudimentary knowledge on the potential of the blue spectral band in monitoring burned area vegetation.",2020,"{""Kadzunge, Shamiso Lynnet"",""Mpakairi, Kudzai Shaun"",""Ndaimani, Henry""}",10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100365,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Role And Impact Of Urban Water Prices On The Management Of Groundwater Consumption Due To Covid-19 Outbreaks,"The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental role and impact of urban water prices, and hence its consumption in Tehran on its groundwater level drawdown. The issue gets vital in times of drought when the scarcity value of water exceeds benefits of groundwater environmental flow. Hence, the argument is that urban water tariffs may play a role in managing groundwater flow. In this regard, the harmful impact of urban water consumption on the environmental flow of groundwater resources is distinguished. Then the objective would be to identify determinants of urban water consumption. To do so, an urban water's demand function, including important key regressors such as price, income, temperature, and rainfall is estimated. Moreover, the role of Covid-19 in urban water consumption is highlighted. Results show a demand elasticity of -0.29 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 for urban water consumption, or that a 10 percent increase in average price results in a decline in urban water consumption of 1.9-3.9 percent. In addition, one percent lower urban water consumption causes 1.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 percent less groundwater extraction, or that response of a 10 percent decrease in the consumption could cause a decline in groundwater extraction of 12-14 percent. Last but not least, a 1 percent decrease in underground extraction for urban water raises 13.2 \& PLUSMN; 6.7 cm of GRACE water level after three months. The results show that groundwater exploitation for urban drinking water is a responsible contributor to the water level drawdown in Tehran. In addition, the significant elasticity of 0.29 shows that price mechanisms are useful to manage hydrological scarcity and the consequent disasters. Moreover, observing significant effects of covid-related determinants for calming down the upward trend of groundwater extraction, we alert for postcovid deterioration of subsidence areas due to regrowth of water consumption.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100996,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Deep Learning For Automatic Outlining Agricultural Parcels: Exploiting The Land Parcel Identification System,"Accurate and up-to-date information on the spatial and geographical characteristics of agricultural areas is an indispensable value for the various activities related to agriculture and research. Most agricultural studies and policies are carried out at the field level, for which precise boundaries are required. Today, high-resolution remote sensing images provide useful spatial information for plot delineation; however, manual processing is time-consuming and prone to human error. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning (DL) approach, in particular a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, for the automatic outlining of agricultural plot boundaries from orthophotos over large areas with a heterogeneous landscape. Since DL approaches require a large amount of labeled data to learn, we have exploited the open data from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) from the Chartered Community of Navarre, Spain. The boundaries of the agricultural plots obtained from our methodology were compared with those obtained using a state-of-the-art methodology known as gPb-UCM (global probability of boundary followed by ultrametric contour map) through an error measurement called the boundary displacement error index (BDE). In BDE terms, the results obtained by our method outperform those obtained from the gPb-UCM method. In this regard, CNN models trained with LPIS data are a useful and powerful tool that would reduce intensive manual labor in outlining agricultural plots. © 2013 IEEE.",NA,NA,10.1109/access.2019.2950371,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Fusion Of Lidar And Aerial Imagery To Map Wetlands And Channels Via Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"Wetlands and channels provide significant ecological and societal services. Mapping their locations and types at high resolution remains a challenge for scientific communities and regulatory agencies. In the U.S.A., the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) provides the best nationwide wetland maps, but the NWI for some locations has not been updated for up to four decades and includes omission errors. To address these problems, we developed a deep learning framework for identifying wetlands and channels from lidar point clouds and 1 m aerial images. Both deep learning and terrain analysis were applied to classify wetlands and identify channels. The deep learning classifier was a convolutional neural network that utilized both image color information and lidar-derived canopy height. When tested on a 94 km(2) Ohio watershed, the method achieved a classification accuracy of 85.6\%. Compared with the NWI maps, the results included 76\% more forested wetlands by area and 168\% more channels by length. It was also found that only leaf-off images were useful for detecting forested wetlands and typical commission errors (i.e., false positives) were attributed to tree shadows. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining lidar structural and aerial spectral information over the use of each alone and exemplifies the utility of deep learning as an effective means to leverage open-source data for high resolution mapping of wetlands.",NA,NA,10.1177/03611981221095522,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Diversification Of Land Surface Temperature Change Under Urban Landscape Renewal: A Case Study In The Main City Of Shenzhen, China","Unprecedented rapid urbanization in China during the past several decades has been accompanied by extensive urban landscape renewal, which has increased the urban thermal environmental risk. However, landscape change is a sufficient but not necessary condition for land surface temperature (LST) variation. Many studies have merely highlighted the correlation between landscape pattern and LST, while neglecting to comprehensively present the spatiotemporal diversification of LST change under urban landscape renewal. Taking the main city of Shenzhen as a case study area, this study tracked the landscape renewal and LST variation for the period 1987-2015 using 49 Landsat images. A decision tree algorithm suitable for fast landscape type interpretation was developed to map the landscape renewal. Analytical tools that identified hot-cold spots, the gravity center, and transect of LST movement were adopted to identify LST changes. The results showed that the spatial variation of LST was not completely consistent with landscape change. The transformation from Green landscape to Grey landscape usually increased the LST within a median of 0.2 degrees C, while the reverse transformation did not obviously decrease the LST (the median was nearly 0 degrees C). The median of LST change from Blue landscape to Grey landscape was 1.0 degrees C, corresponding to 0.5 degrees C in the reverse transformation. The imbalance of LST change between the loss and gain of Green or Blue landscape indicates the importance of protecting natural space, where the benefits in terms of temperature mitigation cannot be completely substituted by reverse transformation.",2017,"{""Liu, Yanxu"",""Peng, Jian"",""Wang, Yanglin""}",10.3390/rs9090919,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Drought Impact Assessment Based On Principal Component Analysis And Copula Function,"Drought is one of the most important agricultural disasters in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Assessing the influence of the droughts in the plain accurately can provide reference for drought mitigation and maintaining stable crop yields. Based on remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which was calculated at ten-day intervals for monitoring droughts in the years of 2008-2013 in the plain, the Copula function method was used to assess the effect of drought at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yields. The mutually independent principal factors were extracted from the VTCIs at the main growth stages of winter wheat by using principal component analysis (PCA), overcoming difficulty of parameter estimation for multivariate Copula, and then incorporated into the Copula function to establish a PCA-Copula method. The comprehensive values of VTCIs at the main growth stages were determined by the PCA-Copula method, and then linear regression model between the comprehensive VTCIs and wheat yields was established to assess the effect of drought on the yields. The results showed that the linear correlation coefficient between the wheat yields and comprehensive VTCIs was at the extremely significant level (P<0.001). Compared with the linear regression model based on the entropy value method, the determination coefficient of the model with the PCA-Copula method reached 0.49 from 0.39, which indicated that the fitting degree of the model was improved, and the root mean square error and average relative error between the estimated and measured yields reduced by 30.2 kg/hm2 and 0.66%, respectively. These results indicated that the PCA-Copula method was a better approach for accessing the impact of droughts at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yield. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

A Multiscalar Approach To Mapping Marginal Agricultural Land: Smallholder Agriculture In Malawi,"Marginal agricultural lands are defined here by suboptimal biophysical conditions and historically variable or low agricultural production. We characterize these areas using remotely sensed information to disentangle the biophysical and possible social factors driving marginality. Considering both the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy problem, the heuristic we propose is generalizable across geographies and scales and provides information at multiple decision-making levels through a multiscalar interannual variability model. We present results from our study of Malawi, where the landscape is densely cultivated and smallholder farmers frequently occupy marginal lands, to illustrate the potential of a multiscalar analysis in a place where food insecurity alleviation is needed and where remote sensing can provide necessary information. Our framework for identifying marginal agricultural lands consists of (1) locating long-term agricultural land, (2) measuring interannual productivity of long-term farmed locations, and (3) assessing marginal biophysical land characteristics and the fundamental climate niche for the dominant crop (in this case maize). Productivity and marginality in Malawi are spatially organized, and an assessment of productivity at multiple scales highlights the importance of presenting both global and local spatiotemporal variability for managing agroecological variance. By disaggregating broad classes of historically marginal production and the underlying drivers of marginality, different intervention efforts can intelligently target areas most likely to receive maximum benefit. These methodologies can be applied by both policymakers and scholars to identify and target marginal agricultural areas for improved productivity and for the support of smallholder farmer livelihoods.",2018,"{""Messina, Joseph P."",""Peter, Brad G."",""Snapp, Sieglinde S.""}",10.1080/24694452.2017.1403877,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Biologically Important Areas Ii For Cetaceans Within Us And Adjacent Waters - Aleutian Islands And Bering Sea Region,"We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetaceans in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This effort, the second led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for BIA II came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; whaling data, including stomach and fecal contents; prey studies; and genetics. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, the BIA II products incorporate a scoring and labeling system, which will improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans.

Field Spectroscopy For Weed Detection In Wheat And Chickpea Fields,"Weed control is commonly performed by applying selective herbicides homogeneously over entire agricultural fields. However, applying herbicide only where needed could have economical and environmental benefits. The objective of this study was to apply remote sensing to the detection of grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal and broadleaf crops. Spectral relative reflectance values at both leaf and canopy scales were obtained by field spectroscopy for four plant categories: wheat, chickpea, grass weeds, and broadleaf weeds. Total reflectance spectra of leaf tissues for botanical genera were successfully classified by general discriminant analysis (GDA). The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 +/- 4.19\% for wheat and 94 +/- 5.13\% for chickpea. The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for future Vegetation and Environmental Monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENS) bands was 77 +/- 8.09\% for wheat and 88 +/- 6.94\% for chickpea, and for the operative satellite Advanced Land Imager (ALI) bands was 78 +/- 7.97\% for wheat and 82 +/- 8.22\% for chickpea. Within the critical period for weed control, an overall classification accuracy of 87 +/- 5.57\% was achieved for >5\% vegetation coverage in a wheat field, thereby providing potential for implementation of herbicide applications. Qualitative models based on wheat, chickpea, grass weed, and broadleaf weed spectral properties have high-quality classification and prediction potential that can be used for site-specific weed management.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2013.793860,{validation},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Spatial Analysis Of Early Mangrove Regeneration In The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, Using Geomatics","Successful mangrove tree regeneration is required to maintain the provision of wood for silviculturally managed mangrove forest areas and to ensure mangrove rehabilitation in disturbed areas. Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118213,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Mechanisms Of Group-Hunting In Vertebrates,"Group-hunting is ubiquitous across animal taxa and has received considerable attention in the context of its functions. By contrast much less is known about the mechanisms by which grouping predators hunt their prey. This is primarily due to a lack of experimental manipulation alongside logistical difficulties quantifying the behaviour of multiple predators at high spatiotemporal resolution as they search, select, and capture wild prey. However, the use of new remote-sensing technologies and a broadening of the focal taxa beyond apex predators provides researchers with a great opportunity to discern accurately how multiple predators hunt together and not just whether doing so provides hunters with a per capita benefit. We incorporate many ideas from collective behaviour and locomotion throughout this review to make testable predictions for future researchers and pay particular attention to the role that computer simulation can play in a feedback loop with empirical data collection. Our review of the literature showed that the breadth of predator:prey size ratios among the taxa that can be considered to hunt as a group is very large (10(2)). We therefore synthesised the literature with respect to these predator:prey ratios and found that they promoted different hunting mechanisms. Additionally, these different hunting mechanisms are also related to particular stages of the hunt (search, selection, capture) and thus we structure our review in accordance with these two factors (stage of the hunt and predator:prey size ratio). We identify several novel group-hunting mechanisms which are largely untested, particularly under field conditions, and we also highlight a range of potential study organisms that are amenable to experimental testing of these mechanisms in connection with tracking technology. We believe that a combination of new hypotheses, study systems and methodological approaches should help push the field of group-hunting in new directions.",2023,"{""Bartashevich, Palina"",""Burns, Alicia"",""Domenici, Paolo"",""Hansen, Matthew J."",""Krause, Jens""}",10.1111/brv.12973,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",""Review or opinion""}"
Influence Of Technology Adoption On Farmers’ Well-Being: Systematic Literature Review And Bibliometric Analysis,"This study aimed at determining the effects of technology adoption on farmers' well-being. Specifically, we analysed and extended the current understanding of the topic by focusing on the concepts of technology adoption and well-being. The data were sourced from 30 papers that were selected based on specific criteria from the WoS and Scopus databases. They were acquired through a systematic search and quality appraisal process. The adopted technology can be grouped into sustainable agricultural practices and innovations, digital agriculture and information technology, precision farming and resource management, financial inclusion and agricultural transactions, remote sensing and satellite technology, and agricultural programs and initiatives. Most papers indicated that technology adoption improved farmers' well-being which was basically measured using productivity and income. The measure however lacked farmers' value judgments, such as happiness. Agricultural technology could have a mixed effect on farmers' well-being, depending on the type of technology adopted and the compatibility of farmers with technology in their agricultural practices. This study will assist researchers in developing an appropriate framework and strategy to improve farmers' welfare, which can alleviate poverty. These may further help policymakers identify the best technological innovations that can improve farmers' economic and social welfare, thereby facilitating the development of plans to meet farmers’ needs and interests. Finally, the study suggested future research directions for researchers and academics. © 2024",NA,NA,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24316,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
"Constraints Of Grassland Science, Pastoral Management And Policy In Northern China: Anthropological Perspectives On Degradational Narratives","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the implications of policies, practices and new “non-equilibrium” management approaches in mobile grassland management. Design/methodology/approach – The author takes an actor-oriented perspective on the narrative of land-use practices, notional sustainable stocking rates and the problematic of state policy interventions in local context. The paper is based on two years in the field on a bilateral aid-funded grassland management project at Xing'an League, Inner Mongolia and follow-up among selected informants. Findings – The constitution of grasslands “degradation” is in fact contested by resource users. Most grassland scientists, Party and Government officials in China have tended to associate ethnic “minority” mobile pastoralists with destructive cultural practices that, they argue, have led to ecological decline on the steppes. This argument is integral to the “degradation narrative” that underpins the discourse on grassland science. The conventional bio-ecology emphasis on species dominance (growth-form), in fact says little about the extent of anthropogenic impacts on above-ground biomass and whether these factors have been the cause of degradation. The paper suggests that greater consideration is given to specific changes in human activity, climatic and plant productivity over time and space, based on endogenous, flexible seasonal estimates. Research limitations/implications – Although presenting challenges to conventional grassland science based on endogenous experiences and herder practices, it may have specific geopolitical limits to more general scaling-up in different contexts. Practical implications – The paper discusses new modalities of non-equilibrium grassland management, inverting normative top-down approaches to controlling environmental degradation, livestock distribution and stocking rates. Social implications – The paper suggests rethinking the use of customary practices, vernacular knowledge and the social organisation of herders in the design of sustainable grassland management. Originality/value – The paper may be valuable to practitioners, rural development planners, funders and researchers interested in the use of integrated, cross-disciplinary, new ecological knowledge in grassland management. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",NA,NA,10.1108/14468951211262251,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"
Forecasting Terrestrial Water Storage For Drought Management In Ethiopia,"Reliable seasonal forecasting of water resources variability may be of great value for agriculture and energy management in Ethiopia. This work aims to develop statistical forecasting of seasonal total water storage (TWS) anomalies in Ethiopia using sea-surface temperature and sea-level pressure indices. Because of the spatial and temporal variability of TWS over the country, Ethiopia is divided into four regions each having similar TWS dynamics. Periods of long-term water deficit observed in GRACE TWS products for the region are found to coincide with periods of meteorological drought. Multiple linear regression is employed to generate seasonal forecasting models for each region. We find that the skill of the resulting models varies from region to region, withR(2)from 0.33 to 0.73 and correlation from 0.27 to 0.77 between predicted and observed values (using leave-one-out cross-validation). The skill of the models is better than the climatology in all regions.",NA,NA,10.1080/02626667.2020.1790564,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Geolocation Of Free-Ranging Fish On The European Continental Shelf As Determined From Environmental Variables - I. Tidal Location Method,"Demersal fish cannot readily be tracked using satellite-based or light-based geolocation techniques. As an alternative, we describe the tidal location method, which uses tidal data recorded by electronic data storage tags (DSTs), to determine geoposition. Times of high water (H) and tidal ranges (R) recorded by DSTs moored at known locations, and from free-swimming tagged plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, were compared with a North Sea tidal database to identify all positions with matching values of H and R. Within the recording precision of the tag (+/-0.2 m, +/-10 min) and the predicted accuracy of the model generated tidal data (+/-0.15 m, +/-20 min), geolocations over much of the North Sea and eastern English Channel were predicted to be accurate to within 40 kin, sometimes to within 10 km. Positional estimates of the moored tags were within 15.7+/-3.5 km of the actual locations. Geolocations made from tagged plaice within 5 days of release and 5 days pre-recapture were within 35+/-24 km and 37+/-23 km of release and recapture positions respectively. Our results demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately describe the migrations of North Sea plaice throughout their geographical range with a level of accuracy unattainable using light-based geolocation. The method could equally be applied to any shelf-dwelling demersal fish that periodically rests on the sea-bed for the duration of a tidal cycle. In fisheries management, the method has clear potential application in defining the movements and migrations of other commercial species.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00227-002-0984-5,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Changes Of Ecological Environment Quality And Its Coupling Coordination With Urbanization In The Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, China","It is inevitable that urban agglomeration will have a coercive impact on the regional Ecological Environment Quality (EEQ) as a consequence of high-speed urbanization. Balancing the EEQ and urbanization development has become a problem worthy of attention. In order to objectively evaluate the EEQ of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) and explore the impact of the urbanization process on it, this paper is based on the Modified Remote Sensing Ecological Index (MRSEI) and the Comprehensive Night Light Index (CNLI), respectively, and conducts a quantitative assessment of the YRDUA in China from 2000 to 2020. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the MRSEI of the YRDUA first decreased and then increased, and the ecological environment quality degraded first and then improved; however, there were significant differences between regions. The ecological environment quality in the south is obviously better than that in the north, and the ecological environment quality in the north changes more drastically, and the low value area of MRSEI will gradually move downstream as time changes; (2) During the study period, the YRDUA formed a hierarchical and progressive urbanization pattern. The inland urbanization process expanded from east to west along the Yangtze River, and the urbanization process of coastal cities expanded from Shanghai as the center to the north and south with high-intensity urbanization cities concentrated in Shanghai and its surrounding cities and low-intensity urbanization cities distributed in the western part of the urban agglomeration; (3) The Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) between urbanization and EEQ in the YRDUA has continuously improved with an increase of 28.57\% in the past 21 years, and the number of cities with high level coupling continues to rise, while the number of medium level coupling cities and low level coupling cities has declined. As a large-scale and long-term analysis of changes in the EEQ and the urbanization process, this study can provide theoretical support for policymakers to formulate mesoscale development planning, EEQ monitoring, and environmental protection policies.",2023,"{""Shi, Zhiyu"",""Wang, Yating"",""Zhao, Qing""}",10.3390/ijerph20021627,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"A Case Study On The Relationship Between Land Surface Temperature And Land Surface Indices In Raipur City, India","Land surface temperature (LST) depends primarily on the land surface material and climatic conditions. The present study focuses on deriving the LST of Raipur City and generating the relationship between LST and some land surface indices, like NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, NMDI, and NDBaI for better land-use planning and environmental management inside the city. These land surface indices respond in different ways with the changes of LST in an urban landscape. There are only a few numbers of research works available on the relationship of LST and land surface indices in a tropical city for pre-monsoon season. The present study has been performed on a total of fifteen multi-date Landsat data sets of the pre-monsoon season from 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. The mono-window algorithm has been applied in retrieving the LST. Results show that LST builds a positive relation with NDBI, NDBaI, and NDWI and a negative relation with NDVI and NMDI. These relationships are stronger in the area below mean LST (low LST zones) and weaker in the area above mean LST (high LST zones). It indicates that the values of LST are largely influenced by the different land surfaces, like vegetation, water, soil, and built-up area.",NA,NA,10.1080/00167223.2020.1752272,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Retrieval Of Forest Stand Age From Sar Image Texture For Varying Distance And Orientation Values Of The Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix,"Data on forest variables (e. g., biomass, trunk height, density) are necessary for environmental and forest management applications. It has been shown that texture can be used instead of the usual sigma(0)/age relationships at P-band to retrieve plantation forest parameters, but the analysis of sigma(0) spatial characteristics has not been fully explored. The aim of this letter is to investigate the relationships between stand age (which is correlated to forest variables) and texture descriptors calculated from statistics generated by the gray-level co-occurrence matrix for varying distance d, and orientation alpha, values used to calculate the matrix. Synthetic aperture radar images are P-band airborne data acquired by the ONERA RAMSES instrument over a controlled homogeneous test site located in the Landes region, France. It is found that texture descriptors contrast, inverse difference moment, homogeneity, and correlation are strongly influenced by the parameters (d, alpha) related to forest stand structure (forest rows, stand density) and image resolution. In contrast, energy and entropy are observed to be highly correlated to stand age and displayed a stable performance whatever the distance and orientation parameters (d, alpha), thus rendering them a good contender as an alternative to the usual sigma(0) based relationships applied to this type of forest.",2014,"{""Alborini, Arnaud"",""Champion, Isabelle"",""Da Costa, Jean Pierre"",""Dubois-Fernandez, Pascale"",""Germain, Christian""}",10.1109/lgrs.2013.2244060,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Research Progress On Trade-Offs And Synergies Of Ecosystem Services: An Overview,"Being the core of ecosystem assessment, studies on ecosystem services have been becoming a focus in the field of ecology. The formation and provisioning capacity of ecosystem services are tremendously affected by human activities. Conversely, the magnitudes of ecosystem service changes also influence the preferences of human being's daily decision- making. Investigation into the dynamics of the trade-offs and synergistic relationships of regional ecosystem services will shed light on interactions and feedbacks between ecosystem services and the stakeholders at different spatial and temporal scales, and avoid double-counting issue in ecosystem services assessment. In addition, information and progress on trade- offs and synergies in the delivery of ecosystem services will provide scientific basis for designing and implementing eco- compensation schemes and optimize the management behavior of ecosystem services, and finally improve human well-being associated with trade-offs and synergies among different ecosystem services. It is revealed from this review that in the last decades, the valuation of ecosystem services has been received lots of attentions in the decision-making and scientific research communities. However, the double-counting issue during the valuation process usually leads to insufficient or biased guidance in the management of ecosystem services. Since ecosystem service is benefit that human receives from the natural ecosystems, the stakeholders' demand for ecosystem services from different spatial and temporal scales often causes competitions and conflicts among ecosystem's various goods and services. The interactions between human being and ecosystem services often give rise to trade-offs and synergies which in turn directly affect human welfare. With regard to the terminologies, trade-offs between ecosystem services refers to the enhancement of one ecosystem service locally in a short term is at the cost of other ecosystem services locally or at a large spatial scale (e. g., globally) in the future. It can be simplified as the ""win-lose"" mode. The term synergies means the synchronous changes between two or among many different ecosystem services, including the ""win-win"" mode and the ""lose-lose"" mode. The trade-offs and synergistic relationships exist not only within different categories of provisioning services, but also among different ecosystem services and like provision services, regulation services, cultural services, and supporting services. Findings from about 12 literatures has shown specific examples of such kind of trade-offs and synergistic relations, for instance, among provisioning services, between regulating services and cultural services, between provisioning services and supporting services, among regulating services, and between provisioning services and regulating services. The spatial scale of trade-offs and synergies contain various scales, for instance, from ecological scale to institutional scale. The temporal scale could be short-term to long-term based. This paper indicates that so far, trade-offs and synergies analysis of ecosystem services is still at its early stage. However, we identified and summarized two research approaches which have already been commonly used for the analysis of ecosystem services' trade-offs: (1) the Integrated Ecological-Economic Model: it is a traditional approach which is often used to quantify trade-offs. The Model consists of several ecological and economic models. The ecological models are mostly used to analyze the magnitudes of the changes of ecosystem services, while the economic models to evaluate the impacts of the change on human welfare. Since land use and land cover change serves as a direct driving factor of the ecosystem services' trade-offs and synergies, it will become even more extensive due to intensification of interactions between the two in the future. (2) Scenarios Analysis based on Landuse is attracting more and more attention in scientific literature. Remote sensing data and management policies of ecosystem services provd strong data basis for the scenarios formulation and analysis. It could provide more objective and spatially-explicit information on the trade-offs and synergies for optimizing ecosystem services management.",NA,NA,10.5846/stxb201109161360,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",""Review or opinion""}"
"The Temporal Variation Of Sediment Connectivity From 1982 To 2020 In The Wei River Basin, China","Sediment connectivity is a valuable metric that characterizes the relationship between sediment transport from the source to the sink, and the ease of sediment erosion. Over the past four decades, changes in land use types and vegetation cover have significantly altered sediment dynamics in the Wei River basin. In this study, we used the index of connectivity (IC) to assess the temporal changes in sediment connectivity at a watershed scale. We employed Landsat images to analyse the relationship between changes in vegetation cover or land use type and sediment connectivity. We used factor detector and interaction detector in Geodetector to analyse the importance and impact of vegetation and slope on IC changes. We assessed the correlation of sediment yield and connectivity to validate our results and it shows that IC has strong or moderate positive correlation with sediment yield from eight out of nine stations in the Wei River Basin. Our findings demonstrate that soil and water conservation measures, as well as the grain for green project, have led to the transformation of cropland and grassland into woodland. This change is reflected in the decrease of the maximum IC value from 6.24 to 5.72 in the Beiluo sub-basin, indicating a decreasing trend in sediment connectivity. Although the maximum IC value increased from 5.76 to 5.08 in the Jing sub-basin, driven by human activity, showing an increasing trend. Furthermore, the IC value decreased in the western part of the Wei sub-basin. Overall, sediment connectivity exhibits a weak decreasing trend in most regions of the Wei River basin, while it shows an increasing trend slightly in the Jing sub-basin. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.86, with sediment yield being moderately or strongly correlated with IC. Our study identified vegetation, human activity, and slope as the main influencing factors of IC. The results of factor detector showed that the q value of vegetation was 0.63 and the slope was 0.1, Vegetation played a major role in the change of IC. The results of interaction detector showed that interaction between vegetation and slope was greater than the single factor. The temporal variability of sediment connectivity in the basin provides valuable insights for sediment transport management. Our research highlights the importance of studying sediment connectivity and offers proposals for measures that can be taken to address sediment transport challenges in the Wei River basin.

"Long-Time Series Ecological Environment Quality Monitoring And Cause Analysis In The Dianchi Lake Basin, China","As the core area in the transformation of Kunming into an international center city, studying the changes in ecological environment quality and causes of the Dianchi Lake Basin is of great significance for its future optimization of the landscape pattern. This study is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to calculate the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) of the Dianchi Lake Basin from 1990 to 2020. Then we used Mann-Kendall mutation detection to obtain the time points when significant changes in RSEI occurred. Finally, the Geodetector and MGWR models were combined to analyse the driving factors of ecological quality changes in the Dianchi Lake Basin. The results show that: (1) The ecological environment quality of the Dianchi Lake Basin showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2020, with the mean value of RSEI increasing from 0.49 to 0.52. (2) According to the results of the mutation test, the years 1990, 1993, 2006, 2015, and 2020 were used as the time points for monitoring the ecological environment quality of the Dianchi Lake Basin over a long time series. The ecological environment quality of the study area in the past 30 years was mainly in an improved state, accounting for 49.43%. The ecological deterioration areas are mainly located in the northeastern part of Xishan District (north of Caohai Lake), the southwestern part of Guandu District, Kunyang Town in Jining District, and the northern areas of Jincheng and Shangsuan Town. (3) The single factor detection results show that elevation and slope have the strongest influence on RSEI. The q-value of average annual temperature has changed the most, from the 6th to the 3rd place. This indicates that the urban heat island effect and the expansion of construction land have had a greater impact on the quality of the local ecological environment in recent years. The multi-factor interaction test shows that the influence of each factor on RSEI is enhanced after the interaction. (4) The MGWR regression results show that the actual scales of action of the factors are inconsistent, with the most significant spatial heterogeneity in the Percentage of cropland area. Based on the above findings, it can provide data to support the future urban planning of the Dianchi Lake Basin.

Multi-Temporal Trend Analysis Of Coastal Vegetation Using Metrics Derived From Hyperspectral And Lidar Data,"Monitoring and modeling of coastal vegetation and wetland systems are considered major challenges, especially when considering environmental response to hazards, disturbances, and management activities. Remote sensing applications can provide alternatives and complementary approaches to the often costly and laborious field-based collection methods traditionally used for coastal ecosystem monitoring. New and improved sensors and data analysis techniques have become available, making remote sensing applications attractive for evaluation and potential use in monitoring coastal vegetation properties and ecosystem conditions and change. This study involves the extraction of vegetation metrics from airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to quantify coastal dune vegetation characteristics and assesses landscape-level trends from those derived metrics. HSI- and LiDAR-derived elevation (digital elevation model) and vegetation metrics (canopy height model, leaf area index, and normalized difference vegetation index) were used in conjunction with per-pixel linear regression and hot spot analyses to evaluate hurricane-induced spatial and temporal changes in elevation and vegetation properties. These assessments showed areas with greatest decreases in vegetation metric values were associated with direct tropical storm energies and processes (i.e., overwashing events eroding beach and dune features), while those with the greatest increases in vegetation metric values were in areas where overwashed sediments were distributed. This study narrows existing gaps in dune vegetation data by advancing new methodologies to classify, quantify, and estimate critical coastal vegetation metrics. The tools and methods developed in this study will ultimately improve future estimates and predictions of nearshore dynamics and impacts from disturbance events.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15082098,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Irrigation Cooling Effect As A Climate Regulation Service Of Agroecosystems,"Agroecosystems provide a range of benefits to society and the economy, which we call ecosystem services (ES). These services can be evaluated on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The irrigation cooling effect (ICE), given its influence on the land surface temperature (LST), is an indicator of climate regulation services from agroecosystems. In this context, the objective of this study is to quantify the ICE in agroecosystems at the local scale. The agroecosystem of citrus cultivation in Campo de Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) is used as a case study. Once the LST was retrieved by remote sensing images for 216 plots, multivariate regression methods were used to identify the factors that explain ICE. The use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is proposed, instead of ordinary least squares, as it offsets the spatial dependence and gives a better fit. The GWR explains 78\% of the variability in the LST, by means of three variables: the vegetation index, the water index of the crop, and the altitude. Thus, the effects of the change in land use on the LST due to restrictions on the availability of water (up to 1.22 degrees C higher for rain-fed crops) are estimated. The trade-offs between ICE and the other ES are investigated by using the irrigation water required to reduce the temperature. This work shows the magnitude of the climate regulation service generated by irrigated citrus and enables its quantification in agroecosystems with similar characteristics.",NA,NA,10.3390/w12061553,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Based on the results, the climate of the western zone is different from that of the equatorial zone, where runoff is persistently high throughout the year. Monthly and seasonal runoff show that June, July and August have higher runoff values. The high values for these three months correspond to the rainy season in these regions. Trends of the runoff and precipitation are detected using Mann-Kendall test. Apart of the coastal zones where trends are positive, trends in runoff are mostly negative throughout the Western and Central African regions.

Small Range And Distinct Distribution In A Satellite Breeding Colony Of The Critically Endangered Waved Albatross,"To determine the proximate consequences of the limited breeding distribution of the critically endangered Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata), we present continuous breeding season GPS tracks highlighting differences in behaviour, destinations, and distances travelled between three distinct colonies: two in Galapagos and one closer to the South American continent on Isla de la Plata, where a small number of pairs nest. Accelerometer data paired with GPS locations allowed operational classifications of Waved Albatross behaviour. All birds from Galapagos travelled eastward to the continental shelf and foraged southward along the Peruvian coast. Birds from Isla de la Plata made more and shorter foraging trips and used habitat north of the destinations of Galapagos birds. La Plata birds foraged in areas through which Galapagos birds commuted, and had slower average flight speeds and shorter commutes. Overall, albatrosses from La Plata might operate under a consistently lower return but they also incur lower costs compared to birds from Galapagos, which take fewer trips involving longer time investment. Galapagos birds may be able to forage more effectively based on more abundant or more profitable food patches in those highly productive areas. Foraging destinations of birds from the two Galapagos colonies were similar and overlapped areas that presented localized mortality risk from artisanal fisheries in previous years. This study, performed across the species' breeding range, reveals the different foraging distribution of La Plata albatrosses and the potential conservation value of this small colony in terms of maintenance of spatial diversity and behavioural plasticity.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10336-013-1013-9,"{""satellite colony"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Mining Subsidence Monitoring Using Distributed Scatterers Insar Based On Goldstein Filter And Fisher Information Matrix-Weighted Optimization,"Due to the shortcomings of traditional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technologies in mining subsidence monitoring, such as a low density of monitoring points and difficulty obtaining fine surface deformation information, this paper proposes a mining area surface deformation monitoring method based on distributed scatterers InSAR while improving the phase information optimization strategy. This method obtains homogeneous points using the hypothesis test of confidence interval algorithm and constructs an adaptive phase optimization method based on the Goldstein principal phase filtering and Fisher information matrix weighting. It effectively preserves the information of deformation fringes, particularly in regions with dense interferometric fringes, and obtains detailed deformation information from the study area through time processing. In the experiments, 63 Sentinel-1 images were used to extract surface subsidence information for the Peibei mining area from September 24, 2018, to November 12, 2020. Compared with the Permanent Scatterers InSAR (PS-InSAR) results, the point density increased by a factor of 4.2. The correlation coefficient between the homonymous points obtained with the two methods and the deformation rate is 0.94, indicating that they have a good consistency. The monitoring results show that the six mining areas in Peibei have different degrees of subsidence during the monitoring period with a clear nonlinear trend, and the maximum cumulative subsidence over time exceeds 350 mm. The analysis shows that the improved DS-InSAR monitoring results are in line with the general law of mining subsidence and have practical application value.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11069-023-06359-2,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Spatial And Temporal Variation Of Net Carbon Sink Function Of Farmland In Aksu Oasis In The Past 17 Years,"Studying the spatial and temporal variations of the net carbon sink function of oasis farmland is important for its management and sustainable development. The net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland was estimated on the basis of remote sensing, meteorological data and agricultural inputs, and other related statistics from 2001 to 2017. The following results are presented. (1) In the past 17 years, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of oasis farmland in Aksu showed an increasing trend yearly, with an average annual growth rate of 7.43%. Among which, the area of oasis farmland with a significant increasing trend of NEP was 1.44 × 104 km2, accounting for 97.7% of its total area, which is mainly distributed in various counties and cities. The area with a significant decreasing trend was 339 km2, accounting for 2.3% of the total area, mainly in the oasis areas of Wensu, Awati, Aksu, and Kuche counties. (2) Carbon emissions from agricultural production inputs increased from 39.94 × 104 t in 2001 to 106.73 × 104 t in 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25.14% and high and low distribution patterns in the Southeast and Northwest, respectively, considering spatial distribution. The largest proportions of agricultural production input pathways are fertilizer and agricultural machinery at 28% and 26%, respectively. (3) From 2001 to 2017, the net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland showed a fluctuating upward trend, spatially demonstrating a gradual increase from Northwest to Southeast, with high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of Wensu county, the western part of Aksu City, the entire territory of Alar City, and the eastern part of Xinhe County. Overall, Aksu oasis farmland has a high net carbon sink capacity. However, regional differences are found in the net carbon sinks of oasis farmland among counties and cities. Thus, the net carbon sink capacity of oasis farmland should be improved by optimizing the agricultural industry structure and enhancing farming measures. © 2022 Editorial office of Arid Zone Research.

Digital Communications And Information Systems,"Introduction: Digital communications and information systems infrastructure is comprised of a variety of communication and computation systems which provide the transmission, processing and storage of digital information. This includes: (i) legacy and fibre-optic cable networks; (ii) mobile, satellite and wireless networks; and (iii) data storage and processing centres. The acronym ICT is often used to describe these systems, though in other contexts ICT can refer to a much broader class of information and communications technologies. Here we use the shorthand ICT to refer to digital communications and information infrastructure systems. In comparison to other physical infrastructure sectors, ICT is relatively new and very rapidly evolving, so is less completely understood from a system-of-systems perspective. ICT infrastructure has become increasingly embedded in nearly all economic and social activities, including for operation of other infrastructure networks. Because of the complexity and rapid innovation in ICT systems, their future is highly uncertain and analysing the systems’ prospective direction is challenging. Yet, issues surrounding digital connectivity are high on the global policy agenda. In many advanced economies in Europe, North America and beyond, significant increases in ICT capacity have been delivered by inducing competition within industry combined with a light-touch, market-led regulatory approach. Innovation has provided new technologies and has helped serve growing consumer demand, which is itself largely driven by innovations in consumer technologies and business practices. Globally, the telecommunications sector has increased dramatically over the past decade to serve almost three billion Internet users, amounting to over 40% of the world's population (ITU, 2014a). Investment in competitive markets by network operators is underpinned by analysis comparing prospective revenues with investment costs (Tselekounis and Varoutas, 2013) so is determined by population density, topology and the capital cost of new technologies (Gotz, 2013). Population density is an important factor in serving local telecommunication markets because, like other infrastructure systems, large fixed-capital investments need to be spread over many consumers with the purchasing power to acquire service subscriptions. However, if left to its own devices the market would likely be considered to be socially unjust and not provide all the potential welfare benefits, as the majority of investment would likely flow into pockets of dense, wealthy and well-educated urban areas. This would particularly leave remote rural or other uneconomically viable locations at a severe disadvantage. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",2016,"{""Ebrahimy, R."",""Jones, C.

"Improving Emergency Treatment For Patients With Acute Stroke: The Pears Research Programme, Including The Pasta Cluster Rct","Background: Intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy are proven emergency treatments for acute ischaemic stroke, but they require rapid delivery to selected patients within specialist services. National audit data have shown that treatment provision is suboptimal. Objectives: The aims were to (1) determine the content, clinical effectiveness and day 90 cost-effectiveness of an enhanced paramedic assessment designed to facilitate thrombolysis delivery in hospital and (2) model thrombectomy service configuration options with optimal activity and cost-effectiveness informed by expert and public views. Design: A mixed-methods approach was employed between 2014 and 2019. Systematic reviews examined enhanced paramedic roles and thrombectomy effectiveness. Professional and service user groups developed a thrombolysis-focused Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment, which was evaluated in a pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial and parallel process evaluation. Clinicians, patients, carers and the public were surveyed regarding thrombectomy service configuration. A decision tree was constructed from published data to estimate thrombectomy eligibility of the UK stroke population. A matching discrete-event simulation predicted patient benefits and financial consequences from increasing the number of centres. Setting: The paramedic assessment trial was hosted by three regional ambulance services (in north-east England, north-west England and Wales) serving 15 hospitals. Participants: A total of 103 health-care representatives and 20 public representatives assisted in the development of the paramedic assessment. The trial enrolled 1214 stroke patients within 4 hours of symptom onset. Thrombectomy service provision was informed by a Delphi exercise with 64 stroke specialists and neuroradiologists, and surveys of 147 patients and 105 public respondents. Interventions: The paramedic assessment comprised additional pre-hospital information collection, structured hospital handover, practical assistance up to 15 minutes post handover, a pre-departure care checklist and clinician feedback. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes included day 90 health (poor status was a modified Rankin Scale score of > 2). Economic outputs reported the number of cases treated and cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life-years and Great British pounds. Data sources: National registry data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme and the Scottish Stroke Care Audit were used. Review methods: Systematic searches of electronic bibliographies were used to identify relevant literature. Study inclusion and data extraction processes were described using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: The paramedic assessment trial found a clinically important but statistically non-significant reduction in thrombolysis among intervention patients, compared with standard care patients [197/500 (39.4%) vs. 319/714 (44.7%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.08; p = 0.15). The rate of poor health outcomes was not significantly different, but was lower in the intervention group than in the standard care group [313/489 (64.0%) vs. 461/690 (66.8%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.2; p = 0.39). There was no difference in the quality-adjusted life-years gained between the groups (0.005, 95% confidence interval –0.004 to 0.015), but total costs were significantly lower for patients in the intervention group than for those in the standard care group (–£1086, 95% confidence interval –£2236 to –£13). It has been estimated that, in the UK, 10,140–11,530 patients per year (i.e. 12% of stroke admissions) are eligible for thrombectomy. Meta-analysis of published data confirmed that thrombectomy-treated patients were significantly more likely to be functionally independent than patients receiving standard care (odd ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.88 to 3.04; n = 1841). Expert consensus and most public survey respondents favoured selective secondary transfer for accessing thrombectomy at regional neuroscience centres. The discrete-event simulation model suggested that six new English centres might generate 190 quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval –6 to 399 quality-adjusted life-years) and a saving of £1,864,000 per year (95% confidence interval –£1,204,000 to £5,017,000 saving per year). The total mean thrombectomy cost up to 72 hours was £12,440, mostly attributable to the consumables. There was no significant cost difference between direct admission and secondary transfer (mean difference –£368, 95% confidence interval –£1016 to £279; p = 0.26). Limitations: Evidence for paramedic assessment fidelity was limited and group allocation could not be masked. Thrombectomy surveys represented respondent views only. Simulation models assumed that populations were consistent with published meta-analyses, included limited parameters reflecting underlying data sets and did not consider the capital costs of setting up new services. Conclusions: Paramedic assessment did not increase the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis, but outcomes were consistent with improved cost-effectiveness at day 90, possibly reflecting better informed treatment decisions and/or adherence to clinical guidelines. However, the health difference was non-significant, small and short term. Approximately 12% of stroke patients are suitable for thrombectomy and widespread provision is likely to generate health and resource gains.

Modeling Regional Crop Yield And Irrigation Demand Using Smap Type Of Soil Moisture Data,"Agricultural models, such as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), have been developed for predicting crop yield at field and regional scales and to provide useful information for water resources management. A potentially valuable input to agricultural models is soil moisture. Presently, no observations of soil moisture exist covering the entire United States at adequate time (daily) and space (similar to 10 km or less) resolutions desired for crop yield assessments. Data products from NASA's upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will fill the gap. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of the SMAP soil moisture data in modeling and forecasting crop yields and irrigation amount. A simple, efficient data assimilation algorithm is presented in which the agricultural crop model DSSAT-CSM is constrained to produce modeled crop yield and irrigation amounts that are consistent with SMAP-type data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating the SMAP data into the agricultural model provides an added benefit of reducing the uncertainty of modeled crop yields when the weather input data to the crop model are subject to large uncertainty.",2015,"{""El Sharif, Husayn"",""Georgakakos, Aris P."",""Wang, Jingfeng""}",10.1175/jhm-d-14-0034.1,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Avulsions Drive Ecosystem Services And Economic Changes In The Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands,"The Pantanal wetland is a mosaic of landscapes that brings together rich biodiversity with the valuable activities of fishing, tourism and ranching. Human occupation and land use in the headwaters have intensified the rate of channel avulsions in the lower reaches of the largest megafan on the Taquari River. This study evaluates the longterm changes of landscapes in the active depositional lobe of the Taquari megafan from the perspective of local communities of pantaneiros. Maps derived from multiple decades of multispectral Landsat data have proven useful for studying land cover changes through the relationship between dry (terrestrial vegetation and soil/dry pastures) and humid landscapes (open waters, aquatic macrophytes and wet soils), as well as through Sankey diagrams and spatiotemporal mapping with Boolean operations according to the rate of dryland recovery. We found that dryland recovery associated with an older and smaller avulsion (known as Ze ' da Costa) is analogous to that of a most recent and much larger avulsion (known as Caronal), which is still ongoing and has greater importance due to the scale of the impacts. Land value and fish capture depreciate as the partial Caronal avulsion still evolves, increasing the likelihood of environmental conflicts. While pantaneiros no longer profit from ecosystem services of provision (e.g., livestock or fishing), dryland recovery may deliver quantifiable ecosystem services of regulation. The strengthening of partnerships among stakeholders and the implementation of environmental compensation mechanisms are central for the best management of the Pantanal's megafans that ensure quality of life for all pantaneiros.",2021,"{""Assine, Mario L."",""Bergier, Ivan"",""Louzada, Romullo O."",""McGlue, Michael M."",""Roque, Fabio O."",""Silva, Aguinaldo""}",10.1016/j.crsust.2021.100057,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Integration Of Urban Growth Modelling Products With Image-Based Urban Change Analysis,"Urban change detection using remotely sensed data has been extensively studied. One current application of detection products is the formulation of calibration data for urban change prediction models. As multi-temporal scenes become available and urban growth prediction models increase in popularity and accuracy, it is natural to envisage a bi-directional relationship where, in addition to detection products assisting prediction models, the prediction information acts as ancillary input to enhance spectral-based change detection products. This closed feedback loop has the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of both detection and prediction efforts. Consequently, our objective is to evaluate the integration of prediction information with spectral data for urban change monitoring. A case study was carried out in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Probabilities of urban change generated from two existing urban prediction models (based on decision trees and logistic regression) are combined as additional information content with a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene. Detailed assessments at the pixel and block scales are implemented to evaluate urban change classification accuracy using different input data and training sample sizes. Results show that in pixel-based assessments, the fusion of decision tree change probabilities and TM spectral bands with sufficient training samples leads to improvements. In terms of overall accuracies, the improvement is 2.02.4\%, from 87.3\% (spectral-only model) and 87.7\% (prediction probability model) to 89.7\% for the fused model. Similarly, the corresponding kappa coefficients show increases of 0.070.08, from 0.60 for the spectral model and 0.61 for the urban prediction model to 0.68 for the fused model. Accuracies aggregated at the block scale present an approximate 2.14.3\% increase when the fusion-based model is employed compared with the exclusive use of either spectral or prediction probability data, namely 87.6\% (fused) vs 83.4\% (spectral) and 85.7\% (prediction). It is also important to state that the standard deviation of accuracies between blocks is significantly reduced by more than 3\% (11.5\% vs 14.9\% and 14.7\%), suggesting higher consistency in classification performance. This is a desirable attribute for subsequent use of these products, for example by the urban planning community. Statistical tests at the block scale also demonstrate that such improvements are significant. It is also observed that to receive the integration benefits, the remote sensing classifier needs a large but reasonable training data set size, while the prediction model should be based on advanced modelling methods. Further assessments on block accuracy with respect to urbanization conditions (i.e. urban presence and change sizes) indicate the ability of the fusion to address spectral limitations, especially in blocks with high relative change. These initial results encourage the expansion of spectral/prediction data fusion to other sites, modelling techniques, and input data.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2013.791760,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Integrating New Technologies To Broaden The Scope Of Northern Spotted Owl Monitoring And Linkage With Usda Forest Inventory Data,"Wildlife monitoring programs designed to inform forest management and conservation decisions in the face of climate change benefit from long-term datasets with consistent methodology. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs may seek to transition to alternative methods because emerging technologies can improve trend tracking and expand the number of target populations, increase spatial scale, and reduce long-term costs. Integrated models strengthen the capacity to adapt long-term monitoring programs to next generation methods. Here we present a case study of northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population monitoring that is under transition. The first monitoring phase focused on territory occupancy and mark-resighting individual owls. Owing to rapidly declining populations and increasing costs, traditional methods are less viable for long-term monitoring. A non-invasive approach, passive acoustic monitoring, is effective for detecting spotted owl presence, estimating occupancy rates, distinguishing sex, detecting trends in populations, and monitoring many additional species. A key component to support transition to passive acoustic monitoring was the development of machine learning models to automate species detections that enable rapid and effective data processing and analysis workflows. Coupling passive acoustic monitoring networks with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) datasets provide powerful tools for predicting forest change impacts on wildlife populations and identify winners and losers in dynamic landscapes. The second monitoring phase will leverage new technologies, expand the scope of inference, link forest inventory and remote sensing datasets, and transition the program to broad biodiversity monitoring that assists managers as they face myriad challenges in dynamic landscapes.",2022,"{""Jenkins, Julianna M.

An Adaptive Method For Identifying Marine Areas Of High Conservation Priority,"Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14 species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress. Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3 primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human activities, and alterations in the marine environment.",NA,NA,10.1111/cobi.13154,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Prediction Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Nutrients Using Terrain Attributes And Remote Sensing Data,"The distribution of the soil organic matter and total nitrogen can provide reliable and useful information for sustainable land management and land use planning. In this study, regression Kriging with environmental predictors was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil nutrients (organic matter and total nitrogen) in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, considering the disadvantages of conventional geo-statistic methods. Terrain and vegetation indicators were chosen for regression Kriging including ten terrain attributes and one vegetation index. The results indicated that relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), roughness of terrain (QFD), rate of gradient (SOS) and NDVI had significant correlations with soil organic matter and total nitrogen. M and Ψ had higher significant correlation with soil organic matter than those with total nitrogen. Relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), surface roughness (M), river dynamic index (Ω) and NDVI were the best predictors for describing soil nutrients in the study area for they described the regression equations most. In Nong'an County, the soil organic matter and total nitrogen distributed regularly from southeast to northwest, and the values were higher in the part of southeast. This distribution pattern was affected by terrain and vegetation factors synthetically, and it had a significant relationship with soil type. Precision assessment results showed that regression Kriging improved the accuracy significantly and it could be an effective method for evaluating the spatial distribution of soil properties.",NA,NA,10.3969/j.issn.1002-6819.2010.05.033,"{""terra = terrain"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"The First Generation Of A Regional-Scale 1-M Forest Canopy Cover Dataset Using Machine Learning And Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform: A Case Study Of Arkansas, Usa","Forest canopy cover (FCC) is essential in forest assessment and management, affecting ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and water regulation. Ongoing advancements in techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping and extracting FCC information require a thorough evaluation of their validity and reliability. The primary objectives of this study are to: (1) create a large-scale forest FCC dataset with a 1-meter spatial resolution, (2) assess the regional spatial distribution of FCC at a regional scale, and (3) investigate differences in FCC areas among the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) and U.S. Forest Service Tree Canopy Cover products at various spatial scales in Arkansas (i.e., county and city levels). This study utilized high-resolution aerial imagery and a machine learning algorithm processed and analyzed using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to produce the FCC dataset. The accuracy of this dataset was validated using one-third of the reference locations obtained from the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) dataset and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery with a 0.6-m spatial resolution. The results showed that the dataset successfully identified FCC at a 1-m resolution in the study area, with overall accuracy ranging between 83.31% and 94.35% per county. Spatial comparison results between the produced FCC dataset and the Hansen et al., 2013 and USFS products indicated a strong positive correlation, with R2 values ranging between 0.94 and 0.98 for county and city levels. This dataset provides valuable information for monitoring, forecasting, and managing forest resources in Arkansas and beyond. The methodology followed in this study enhances efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, as it enables the processing of large-scale datasets with high computational demands in a cloud-based environment. It also demonstrates that machine learning and cloud computing technologies can generate high-resolution forest cover datasets, which might be helpful in other regions of the world. © 2023",NA,NA,10.1016/j.dib.2023.109986,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
"Access To Fertility Care In Geographically Underserved Populations, A Second Look","Infertility has a prevalence of up to 16% worldwide and is on the rise in developed nations, largely due to pursuing childbearing at advanced reproductive ages. Advances in assisted reproductive technology have benefitted socioeconomically advantaged patients disproportionately. High costs of fertility care are largely responsible for this disparity; however, patients in rural areas also face barriers in accessing both gynecology and reproductive endocrinology subspecialty care. Here, focusing on the USA, we discuss fertility care in geographically underserved areas and low-resource settings, and the impact on reproductive outcomes. Increased innovation to improve patient access to fertility care such as assisted reproductive technology is critical for ensuring equity. Remote monitoring is frequently performed by fertility centers, but partnership with local gynecologists has also been demonstrated to be an effective assisted reproductive technology monitoring method. Telehealth is now in mainstream use and the continued application to reduce geographic barriers to infertility patients is imperative. Partnership between local gynecologists and reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialists may improve patient access to fertility care and provide the unique benefits of continuity and ongoing local social support. © 2022, Society for Reproductive Investigation.",NA,NA,10.1007/s43032-022-00991-2,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"

Methods A retrospective chart review collected data from veterans with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that participated in the DSMES-HTK program at 2 Veterans Affairs Northeast Ohio Healthcare System facilities between February 2013 and December 2018. A factorial design was used to compare A1C data and use of clinical video telehealth from main hub to satellite site. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 25). Repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) were performed to compare mean A1C in veterans that attended HTK at the main site versus a telehealth site. RMANOVA was also used to compare mean A1C in veterans that attended at least 1 hands-on class versus those that attended at least 1 demonstration class. Results A1C values of all groups improved over time and were sustained regardless of DSMES-HTK delivery method or location. Conclusions Sustained improvement in A1C was observed in patients that participated in both DSMES-HTK in person and via clinical video telehealth classes conducted by hub site facilitator with RDN, CDCES credential.

Response Of Vegetation Coverage To Climate Change In Mongolian Plateau During Recent 10 Years,"Vegetation in the arid/ semi arid area is highly sensitive to climate change. The Mongolian Plateau climate is mainly controlled by the east Asia monsoon system. Hence both Inner Mongolia and the state of Mongolia (Hereafter: Mongolia) experience a similar arid/semi arid climate but have different anthropological influences via their separate social and economic development histories. In this study, we analyzed in-situ observations from 67 meteorological stations (50 stations in Inner Mongolia and 17 in Mongolia) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) product from SPOT (Satellite pour l') observation de la Terre in French) using Mann-Kendall (MK) tests and Maximum Value Composition (MVC). Our results showed that: (1) Temperature is general higher in the south than the north, while precipitation ranges from low in the west to high in the east. There is a significant warming trend over the whole Mongolian Plateau region from 1961 to 2009, while no obvious trends were found for precipitation; (2) Vegetation coverage in Inner Mongolia was generally greater than that in Mongolia. The time series of vegetation coverage change in these two regions can be divided into two periods. The regional averaged NDVI decreased from 1998 to 2001, fluctuated greatly and then increased continuously from 2009 to 2012. The main degraded areas are located in the Xilingol league, central Inner Mongolia, while they are mostly located in the central and western Mongolia; (3) Positive correlations were found between NDVI and precipitation in desert, steppe vegetation and forest areas in Mongolia, while negative relationships were found for temperature. In Inner Mongolia, NDVI are also positively correlated with precipitation in desert and steppe vegetation areas and also positively correlated with temperature in forests. Recently several major national ecological projects were implemented in Inner Mongolia by national central and local governments, including ""The Return Cropland to Forest"", the ""Return Grazing Land to Grassland"" (Grain for Green), and the Three North Protection Forest Plantation Project. These projects improved the local environment by stopping grazing/ cropping and planting trees. We believe that these policy actions contribute to the vegetation recovery in Inner Mongolia exhibited here in the NDVI. We attribute the different trends and dynamics of vegetation change in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia to human activities since the climate is similar in these two areas. However, the mechanism driving the changes requires further study particularly investigation of the socio-economic drivers of local land use changes. If formal/ informal communication between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia are encouraged in scientific research, cultural exchange and policy making of environmental protection at different levels, it will provide more opportunity for preservation and enhancement of the nomadic culture.",2014,"{""Cui, X."",""He, B."",""Jiang, C."",""Liu, Q."",""Miao, L."",""Zhu, F.""}",10.5846/stxb201304100659,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Devices To Support Treatment Decisions In Type 1 Diabetes: The Diabeo System,"Blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes has improved considerably since the DCCT due to general diffusion of 'physiological' basal-prandial therapeutic schedules, generalization of therapeutic educational programs, functional insulin therapy, insulin analogues, and insulin pumps. However, glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) averages 8% within various studies, which is still unsatisfactory. The creation of new technological tools could lead to new levels of success, as attested by the Diabeo system. This system comprises three programs. The first program automatically calculates basal and prandial insulin doses while taking account of blood glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, and is equipped with algorithms that allow automatic adjustment based on the results obtained. The entire system must first of all be configured by the doctor according to the patient's characteristics, and then it has to be downloaded to a smartphone from a secure website. All of the patient's results and data are then made available for consultation at all times by authorized caregivers, enabling remote monitoring to be performed. The second program analyzes the results and automatically generates coaching messages for the patient and messages for the caregiver in the event of underuse, unsatisfactory results, or inadequate operation of the system. The caregiver may then intervene in a timely fashion via a telephone consultation or modification of the patient's treatment profile. The third program optimizes the doctor's available time by delegating tasks and allowing action to be undertaken by a specialized telemedicine nurse working in conjunction with the responsible diabetologist. An initial version of the system, comprising only the first of these three programs, resulted in a mean reduction in HbA 1c of 0.9% at 6 months versus the control group in a population of patients with chronic glycemic control problems and treated with multiple injections or insulin pump. Analysis of individual patient data shows that the most compliant patients derived the greatest benefit from the dose calculation function, while less compliant patients benefited considerably from the telemonitoring function, which allowed short but repeated consultations at opportune moments. A large-scale national study is currently being initiated in France to confirm these favorable metabolic results at 1 year and to assess the medicoeconomic impact of this system after 2 years of use. Ultimately, the results may lead to granting of reimbursable status for the Diabeo system by the French national social security authorities, followed by widespread use of the system in France and international availability. © 2015 S.

A Conceptual Framework For The Governance Of Multiple Ecosystem Services In Agricultural Landscapes,"ContextWhile the concept of ecosystem services (ES) is well established in the scientific and policy arenas, its operationalization faces many challenges. Indeed, ES supply, demand and flow are related to ecological and social processes at multiple space and time scales, leading to complex interactions in the provision of multiple ES.ObjectivesTo develop a conceptual framework (CF) to facilitate the study and governance of multiple ES in agricultural social-ecological landscapes.MethodWe examined the ecological and social literatures to identify how approaches at the landscape level contribute to a better understanding of ES supply, demand and flow in agricultural systems. After detailing our CF, we use a case study to illustrate how methods from different disciplines can be combined to operationalize our CF.ResultsThe literature suggests that the landscape level is likely to be the level of organization that will make it possible to (i) integrate different components of ES co-production, i.e. ecological processes, agricultural practices and social structures, (ii) understand interactions between stakeholders, including ES co-producers and beneficiaries, (iii) explicit ES trade-offs, i.e. social choices between ES.ConclusionThe production of multiple ES at the landscape level involves different types of interdependencies among ES co-producers and beneficiaries. These need to be addressed in concerted and integrated ways to achieve sustainable and equitable governance of agricultural landscapes.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10980-019-00829-4,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A Statistical Approach To Mapping Flood Susceptibility In The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region,"Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between different region types; for each region flood risk factors were extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and included several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood susceptibility. Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding. Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1, respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope, land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor. An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk factor's influence on flooding in a subregion. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very high risk (80-100\%).

"Remote Monitoring Of Inhaled Bronchodilator Use And Weekly Feedback About Asthma Management: An Open-Group, Short-Term Pilot Study Of The Impact On Asthma Control","Objective: Adequate symptom control is a problem for many people with asthma. We asked whether weekly email reports on monitored use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators might improve scores on composite asthma-control measures. Methods: Through an investigational electronic medication sensor attached to each participant's inhaler, we monitored 4 months' use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators. Participants completed surveys, including the Asthma Control TestTM (ACT), to assess asthma control at entry and monthly thereafter. After the first month, participants received weekly email reports for 3 months. The reports summarized inhaled bronchodilator use during the preceding week and provided suggestions derived from National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines. Paired t-tests and random-effects mixed models were implemented to assess changes in primary asthma endpoints. Results: Thirty individuals participated in the 4-month study; 29 provided complete asthma control information. Mean age was 36.8 years (range: 19-74 years); 52% of respondents were female. Mean ACT scores were 17.6 (Standard Deviation [SD] = 3.35) at entry and 18.4 (SD = 3.60) at completion of the first month. No significant difference appeared between ACT values at entry and completion of the first month (p = 0.66); however, after participants began receiving email reports and online information about their inhaler use, mean ACT scores increased 1.40 points (95% CI: 0.61, 2.18) for each subsequent study month. Significant decreases occurred in 2-week histories of daytime symptoms (β = -1.35, 95% CI: -2.65, -0.04) and nighttime symptoms (β = -0.84, 95% CI: -1.25, -0.44); no significant change in activity limitation (β = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.69, 0.26) was observed. Participants reported increased awareness and understanding of asthma patterns, level of control, bronchodilator use (timing, location) and triggers, and improved preventive practices. Conclusions: Weekly email reports and access to online charts summarizing remote monitoring of inhaled bronchodilator frequency and location were associated with improved asthma control and a decline in day-to-day asthma symptoms.",2013,"{""Magzamen, S."",""Morrison, T."",""Truelove, S."",""van Sickle, D.""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0055335,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Local 3d Scene Fine Detection Analysis Of Circular Landform On The Southern Edge Of Dinosaur Valley,"With the continuous advancement of low-altitude UAV (unmanned air vehicle, UAV) technology for the earth observation and its wide popularity, UAV photogrammetry and SfM (Structure from Motion, SfM) methods have received more and more attention as the latest means to obtain true 3D realistic models of the survey area. As the newest means of measuring geomorphological information, UAV low-altitude photogrammetry and SfM methods can quickly obtain a true 3D realistic model of the survey area, and have been applied to a number of research fields. In this paper, the UAV is used to measure the typical local scene of annular landform at the southern edge of Dinosaur Valley in Lufeng, and the high-resolution geomorphological image data of the investigated area are obtained. Combined with the SFM method, a realistic 3D scene model is constructed, and its geomorphological characteristics are discussed and analyzed. The experimental results show that the DSM (digital surface model, DSM) data based on the SFM method can obtain ground points by filtering, diluting, and classifying the data, and the DEM (digital elevation model, DEM) data with a resolution of 0.2m is constructed by using the progressive encrypted triangular mesh method, which can accurately represent the true geomorphological characteristics of the study area. (2) Construction of three typical elevation profiles of the circular scene “inner-middle-outer,” and comparative analysis of the profiles confirmed that the topography of the study area is characterized by the dome ridge line AA' as the main highland ridge line, showing a circular “basin margin” pattern, with gradually decreasing elevations on the inner and outer sides. (3) In order to reveal the complex tectonic geomorphological features of the external scene between the ridge and trough, the ArcGIS surface analysis method was used to extract the ridge lines J1-J7. Accurate quantitative measurements and analysis were carried out to investigate the slope, slope length, slope direction, ridge area face, and other related parameters. (4) Using the multi-view visual interpretation and typical scene analysis of the three-dimensional 3D model, micro-geomorphological features such as the development of washouts in the survey area and the nodal laminar surface of the geological body can be clearly identified. In addition, the coordinates of the geological body’s spatial location and its production, spreading area, square volume, and other rich geological information can be accurately obtained. Through the above experimental study on the detection of 3D scenes of landforms, the advantages of UAV measurement technology and SFM method to construct DSM data and 3D scene models in fine geological structure detection are demonstrated. This will have an important application prospect and practical value for geological survey, monitoring , prevention and control management in mountainous areas.In addition, the fast, low-cost, high-precision, and non-contact measurement mode can provide accurate data basis and technical support for geological structure detection, geological disaster investigation, risk assessment and prevention and control management. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",NA,NA,10.1007/s12517-021-08101-3,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Mangrove Health Index As Part Of Sustainable Management In Mangrove Ecosystem At Karimunjawa National Marine Park Indonesia,"Background: Monitoring the health of marine ecosystems is an integral part of sustainable management of the ecosystems including mangrove. Distribution and diversity of mangrove ecosystems are two important parameters in Mangrove Health Index (MHI). The index analyses value of mangrove density, diversity, index of similarity and the number of mangrove species. Method: This study investigates mangrove distribution and diversity. Mangrove distribution maps were prepared using Satellite imagery GEO-EYE. Ecological surveys to analyze the diversity of mangrove at five locations, namely Legon Cilik, Legon Gede, Kemujan, Karimunjawa and Menjangan Besar. MHI was calculated by assigning weight for each parameter, multiplied by each parameter score and then summing all of multiplication results value. Results: Satellite image interpretation results showed that mangroves were found at island of Karimunjawa, Menjangan Besar and Sintok. In total, 22 mangrove species identified, 12 species were true mangroves and the rests were mangrove associates. Rhizophora apiculata dominates three of nine survey locations, while Rhizophora stylosa was the dominant species in two of nine locations and the rest are dominated by Ceriops tagal, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia alba. Density of mangrove in the category of tree, mangrove average density ranging from medium to high, from 230 to 1060 ind/ha. In the category of sapling, dominant mangrove species was relatively diverse. In general, the Shannon diversity index was low, it means that mangrove diversity is low, it means that mangrove diversity is low. Mangrove in Legon Cilik 1 and Menjangan Besar had the highest Shannon diversity index (1,09) while Karimun 1 were the lowest (0,18). Conclusion: The value of MHI at Karimunjawa was 200, which is in the medium category. The results suggest that there is a need to improve MHI as part of sustainable management based on the distribution and diversity of mangrove.",NA,NA,10.1166/asl.2017.9155,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Risk Assessment Using Remote Sensing And Hydrodynamic Modeling: A Case Study Of Satluj Basin, Western Himalayas, India","Glacier-associated hazards are becoming a common and serious challenge to the high mountainous regions of the world. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are one of the most serious unanticipated glacier hazards, with the potential to release a huge amount of water and debris in a short span of time, resulting in the loss of lives, property, and severe damage to downstream valleys. The present study used multi-temporal Landsat and Google earth imageries to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamism of the selected glacial lake (moraine-dammed) in the Satluj basin of Western Himalayas. Furthermore, GLOF susceptibility of the lake was assessed using a multi-criteria decision-based method. The results show that the lake area has increased from 0.11 to 0.26 km(2) over the past 28 years from 1990 to 2018. The susceptibility index value for the lake was calculated as 0.75, which indicates that the lake is highly susceptible to the GLOF. The depth and volume of the lake were estimated to be 16 m and 57 x 10(5) m(3), respectively, using an empirical formula. HEC-RAS, HECGeo-RAS, and Arc-GIS software were utilized in this study to perform unsteady flow analysis and to determine the GLOF impact on the downstream area. The worst-case GLOF scenario (breach width of 75 m) was revealed during an overtopping failure of the moraine dam, resulted in a peak discharge of 4060 m(3)/s and releasing a total water volume of 57 x 10(5) m(3). The breach hydrograph has been routed to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of peak flood, inundation depth, velocity, water surface elevation, and flood peak arrival time along the river channel. The analysis further reveals that the routed flood waves reach the nearest settlement, i.e., Rajpur town, situated at a distance of 102 km in the downstream valley of the lake at 6 h after the beginning of the lake breach event with a peak discharge/flood of 1757 m(3)/s and maximum flow velocity of 1.5 m/s. With the ongoing climate warming and glacier retreat, moraine-dammed lakes are becoming more hazardous and thus increasing the total threat. Therefore, it is mandatory to monitor and assess such lakes at regular intervals of time to lessen the disastrous impacts of GLOFs on the livelihood and infrastructure in the downstream valleys. The findings of this study will aid in the creation of risk management plans, preparatory tactics, and risk reduction techniques for GLOF hazards in the region.",2023,"{""Ahmed, Rayees"",""Jain, Sanjay Kumar"",""Lohani, Anil Kumar"",""Rawat, Manish""}",10.1007/s11356-023-25134-1,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Review Of Remote Sensing-Based Methods For Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation: Progress, Challenges, And Prospects","Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for elucidating the global carbon cycle and the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/f14061086,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Spatio-Temporal Changes In Urban Green Space In 107 Chinese Cities (1990-2019): The Role Of Economic Drivers And Policy,"Urban green space (UGS) has gained increasing attention due to its environmental and social functions. However, the compound effects of climate change, population growth and economic development on UGS are largely unknown. We selected 107 medium-sized and large cities in China to investigate dynamics in the spatial pattern of UGS in relation to government policy and other drivers based on remote sensing data for the period 1990 to 2019. To explore the effect of different levels of urbanization on changes in green space, we develop a new Normalized Urban Development Index (NUDI) to classify urban-suburban-rural gradients, viz. Long-term Builtup, New Built-up and Non-Built-up. Then, we analysed changes over time in the annual peak value of fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) for 380,000 cloud-free Landsat images, and regional UGS dynamics were evaluated using the proposed Regional Greenness Dynamic Index (RGDI). Finally, to reveal the major driver(s) of changes in UGS and estimate the extent to which patterns of urban greening are due to differences in economic development, we compared the observed UGS spatio-temporal dynamics with data on several climatic, social-economic and land use related factors for the same period. The NUDI are shown to be highly effective in mapping urban development gradients, with overall accuracy in the identified classes of 89\%. Annual maximum FVC analysis indicates that there was significant greening between 1990 and 2019 in both the long-term built up (10,667.52 km(2)) and the non-built up areas (529,310.47 km(2)), while there was a major increase in browning (25,110.43 km(2)) in the newly built-up areas. The RGDI results indicate that 65\% (71/107) of long-term built-up areas in cities trended greener over 2010 to 2019 under consideration. At the whole city scale, RGDI is negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), although when considering the long-term built-up areas only, economic growth exhibits a significant positive correlation during 2010 to 2019 (R = 0.62, p < 0.01). This study offers important insights as to the patterns of change in urban greening extent over time and its underyling drivers across urban-suburbanrural gradients against the background of urban expansion, afforestation, climate change and economic development.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jag.2021.102525,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Hybrid Rough-Pso Approach In Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis,"Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a very challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always the key features for classifying mixed pixels. This paper proposes an approach for pixel classification using a hybrid approach of rough set theory and particle swarm optimization methods. Rough set theory deals with incompleteness and vagueness among data, which property may be utilized for detecting arbitrarily shaped and sized clusters in satellite images. To enable fast automatic clustering of multispectral remote sensing imagery, in this article, we propose a rough set-based heuristical decision rule generation algorithm. For rough-set-theoretic decision rule generation, each cluster is classified using heuristically searched optimal reducts to overcome overlapping cluster problem. This proposed unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on rough set generated membership values. This approach addresses the overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using rough set generated membership values. Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, inspired from the social behavior of bird flock. Therefore, to predict pixel classification of remote sensing imagery, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based membership correction approach over rough set-based initial decision rule generation. We demonstrate our algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of the catchment area of Ajoy River. The newly developed algorithm is compared with fuzzy C-means and K-means algorithms. The new algorithm generated clustered regions are verified with the available ground truth knowledge. The validity analysis is performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms with K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms.",NA,NA,10.1007/978-81-322-2544-7_10,"{calibration,validation}",excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued""}"
Multilevel Segmentation Algorithm For Agricultural Parcel Extraction From A Semantic Boundary,"Parcels are the basic unit of crop planting and management. Therefore, parcelwise farmland data become the fundamental basis for precision agriculture applications, and the extraction of parcels from high-resolution remote sensing images is of great importance. The deep learning-based edge detection methods have achieved superior performance, but these methods output edge intensity maps with pixel values from 0 to 255 in raster format. Vectorization, which transforms the rasterized data into vectors, is an important post-processing procedures. In this process, segmentation and thinning are two key steps for deriving the one-pixel-wide binary edge, however, the traditional method suffers deviation from the actual edge and the unclosed edge. To address these problems, based on the hypothesis that the larger the edge intensity value is, the greater the likelihood that the pixel is on or near the boundary, we developed a multilevel segmentation method for agricultural parcel extraction from a semantic boundary, which prioritizes using the pixels with high intensity to ensure that the extracted boundaries adhere closely to the actual boundaries and the pixels with low intensity connect the unclosed boundaries, thus simultaneously improving the fidelity and completeness of boundaries. We selected images acquired in Hangzhou Bay and Denmark to test our method, and the result demonstrates that our method can accurately extract agricultural parcels. Compared with the single threshold segmentation method, our method shows higher boundary fidelity and completeness. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves competitive performance in traditional metrics but outperforms edge preservation and one-to-one correspondence between the extracted parcel and actual parcel. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,"{""Chen, T."",""Chen, Y."",""He, Z."",""Wu, N."",""Wu, W."",""Yang, H.""}",10.1080/01431161.2023.2174386,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
High-Resolution Mapping And Driving Factors Of Soil Erodibility In Southeastern Tibet,"Quantifying the spatial distribution of soil erodibility (K factor) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is essential for global soil erosion management. However, many K factor maps have a coarse spatial resolution at the regional scale, and high-resolution mapping is still a challenge. Quantitative analysis of the influence of environmental factors such as soil, topography, climate, and vegetation, and human activities on the K factor is also lacking. Therefore, we mapped the high-resolution (90 m) spatial distribution of the K factor values in southeastern Tibet using a random forest model with multiple environmental variables, based on remote sensing, ground obser-vations (114 sampling points), and gridded datasets. The K factor estimates based on soil particle size compo-sition and organic carbon content ranged from 0.09 to 0.35, showing moderate variation. The random forest model yielded a coefficient of determination > 0.9 and provided detailed information on the spatial distribution of K factor values, especially in large unsampled areas. The predicted K factor values tended to be high in the eastern area and low in the western area. Partial least squares path modeling showed that soil physical properties such as fractal dimension and mean weight diameter of aggregates had the largest influence on the K factor (path coefficient 0.695). Climate and topography also had a considerable influence on the K factor (path coefficient-0.489 and-0.469, respectively), while the influence of vegetation and human activities was minimal. Accordingly, the random forest model is an effective tool for high-resolution spatial distribution mapping of the K factor with limited sampling data.",2023,"{""Jiang, Yefeng"",""Liang, Bo"",""Liang, Wandong"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wan, Dan"",""Yu, Wu""}",10.1016/j.catena.2022.106725,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
A Gis-Based Methodology For Sustainable Farming Planning: Assessment Of Land Use/Cover Changes And Carbon Dynamics At Farm Level,"The assessment of carbon dynamics as a climate-regulation ecosystem service (ES) by modeling of scenarios on land use and land cover (LULC) changes is widely used in environmental conservation studies to support public policies. However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007-2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105788,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Multifactor Colorimetric Analysis On Ph-Indicator Papers: An Optimized Approach For Direct Determination Of Ambient Aerosol Ph,"Direct measurement of the acidity (pH) of ambient aerosol particles/droplets has long been a challenge for atmospheric scientists. A novel and facile method was introduced recently by Craig et al. (2018), where the pH of size-resolved aerosol droplets was directly measured by two types of pH-indicator papers (pH ranges: 0-2.5 and 2.5-4.5) combined with RGB-based colorimetric analyses using a model of G-B (G minus B) vs. pH2. Given the wide pH range of ambient aerosols, we optimize the RGB-based colorimetric analysis on pH papers with a wider detection range (pH ∼ 0 to 6). Here, we propose a new model to establish the linear relationship between RGB values and pH: pHpredict D a • Rnormal C b • Gnormal C c • Bnormal. This model shows a wider applicability and higher accuracy than those in previous studies and is thus recommended in future RGBbased colorimetric analyses on pH papers. Moreover, we identify one type of pH paper (Hydrion® Brilliant pH dip stiks, lot no. 3110, Sigma-Aldrich) that is more applicable for ambient aerosols in terms of its wide pH detection range (0 to 6) and strong anti-interference capacity. Custommade impactors are used to collect lab-generated aerosols on this type of pH paper. Preliminary tests show that, with a collected particle size range of ∼ 0.4-2.2 μm, the pH paper method can be used to predict aerosol pH with an overall uncertainty = 0.5 units. Based on laboratory tests, a relatively short sampling time (∼ 1 to 4 h) is speculated for pH prediction of ambient aerosols. More importantly, our design of the impactors minimizes potential influences of changed environmental conditions during pH paper photographing processes on the predicted aerosol pH. We further show that the routinely adopted way of using pH color charts to predict aerosol pH may be biased by the mismatch between the standard colors on the color charts and the real colors of investigated samples. Thus, instead of using the producer-provided color charts, we suggest an in situ calibration of pH papers with standard pH buffers. © 2020 Author(s).",2020,"{""Cheng, Y."",""Klimach, T."",""Kuhn, U."",""Li, G."",""Li, M."",""Ma, N."",""Pöschl, U."",""Su, H."",""Zheng, G.""}",10.5194/amt-13-6053-2020,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Modeling Of Gully Erosion In Ethiopia As Influenced By Changes In Rainfall And Land Use Management Practices,"Gully erosion is one of the most extreme land degradation processes that exhibit spatial and temporal variation depending on topography, soil, climate, and land use and management characteristics. This study investigated the impact of changes in rainfall, land use/land cover (LULC), and land use management (LUM) practices on gully erosion in two midland watersheds (treated Kecha and untreated Laguna) in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia by using the LANDPLANER model in combination with intensive field measurements and remote sensing products. We simulated gully erosion under past (in 2005), present (in 2021), and three potential future curve number conditions, each time under four rainfall scenarios (10, 30, 60, and 100 mm) using the dynamic erosion index (e), static topographic (esp), and erosion channel (esp\_channel) thresholds. Density plot analyses showed that gullies frequently occur in low-lying gentle slope areas with relatively higher curve number values. The best predictions of gullies identified through true positive rates (TPR) and true negative rates (TNR) were achieved considering the static esp\_channel > 1 for Kecha (TPR = 0.667 and TNR = 0.544) and the dynamic e > 0.1 for 60 mm of rainfall in Laguna (TPR = 0.769 and TNR = 0.516). Despite the 10 mm rainfall having negligible erosion-triggering potential in both watersheds, the 60 and 100 mm rainfall scenarios were 4-5 and 10-17 times, respectively, higher than the 30 mm rainfall scenario. While the LULC change in the untreated Laguna watershed increased the impact of rainfall on gully initiation by only 0-2\% between 2005 and 2021, the combination of LULC and LUM significantly reduced the impact of rainfall in the treated Kecha watershed by 64-79\%. Similarly, the gully initiation area in Kecha was reduced by 28\% (from 33\% in 2005 to 5\% in 2021) due to changes in LULC and LUM practices, whereas Laguna showed little increment by only 1\% (from 42\% in 2005 to 43\% in 2021) due to LULC change. In addition, the future predicted alternative land use planning options showed that gully initiation areas in Laguna could be reduced by 1\% with only LULC conversion; 39\% when only LUM practices were implemented; and 37\% when both were combined. These results indicate that LUM practices outweigh the impact of LULC on gully erosion in the studied paired watersheds. Overall, LANDPLANER successfully simulated the spatio-temporal variation of gully erosion with scenario-based analyses and hence can be used to predict gullies in the study area and other data-scarce regions with similar agro-ecological settings.",2023,"{""Ardizzone, Francesca"",""Berihun, Mulatu Liyew"",""De Geeter, Sofie"",""Ebabu, Kindiye"",""Fenta, Ayele Almaw"",""Haregeweyn, Nigussie"",""Meshesha, Taye Minichil"",""Nzioki, Benedict"",""Rossi, Mauro"",""Setargie, Tadesual Asamin"",""Sultan, Dagnenet"",""Tsubo, Mitsuru"",""Tsunekawa, Atsushi"",""Vanmaercke, Matthias"",""Yibeltal, Mesenbet""}",10.3390/land12050947,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Are Patagonia Grasslands Being Overgrazed? A Response To Marino Et Al. (2020),"Based upon primary productivity estimates, Oliva et al. (2019) concluded that, at the end of last century and after long periods of overgrazing, Patagonia's domestic stocks adjusted to regional-scale herbivore carrying capacity. Populations of guanaco, a native camelid, increased thereafter, driving combined grazing pressures once again over carrying capacity in some areas. Marino et al. (2020) argued that grazing is not really at equilibrium because domestic stocks are concentrated in areas that remain overgrazed. They support the ideas that guanaco density is auto-regulated by resource-defence territoriality, and that guanacos are weak competitors with domestic stock, occupying only marginal areas. In their view, Oliva et al. (2019) put guanacos in the role of scapegoats, leaving domestic stocks unchecked. Equilibrium at regional scale does not preclude overgrazing and under-grazing at local scales. By separating areas with and without domestic stocks, Marino et al. (2020) estimated overgrazing at 28\% in Chubut Province and 73\% in Santa Cruz Province. Our recalculations show 28\% and 47\% domestic overgrazing, respectively. However, when combined with guanaco densities, these increase to 48\% for Chubut and 108\% for Santa Cruz. We question the hypothesised lack of competitive value and efficient self-regulating mechanisms that would prevent guanaco populations from overshooting carrying capacity. A dataset of 13 sheep farms showed mean density of 26 +/- 3.8 guanacos/km(2)and high combined grazing pressures. This was also observed in a protected area of Chubut that reached 42 guanacos/km(2)and crashed during drought, with 60\% mortality. Thereafter, guanacos increased to 70 guanacos/km(2), with recruitment rates that showed a complex response of density dependence but remained relatively elevated at densities above the estimated carrying capacity. Synthesis and applications. Marino et al. (2020) are right to question the apparent equilibrium of domestic stocks that are concentrated in areas that may be still overgrazed. But ground data show that guanaco populations have inefficient density population regulation and can reach densities well over carrying capacity, even in the presence of sheep. This does not mean that the main control should be on growing guanaco populations but it stresses our conclusion that joint management of the native-domestic herbivore system is urgently needed. Joint management can be effected through local plans, as current guanaco management permits can only be issued in areas that are not overgrazed by sheep. Farm management plans may in this way transform an apparent competitor into a valuable resource, complementary to sheep raising.",2020,"{""Cepeda, Carla"",""Ferrante, Daniela"",""Oliva, Gabriel"",""Paredes, Paula"",""Rabinovich, Jorge""}",10.1111/1365-2664.13753,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"The Climate Adaptive Characteristics Of Urban Inside/Outside Water Bodies Based On Their Cooling Effect In Poyang And Dongting Lake Regions, China","Most publications have focused on the cooling effect of urban inside water bodies. However, the climate adaptive characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies is seldom studied. In this paper, three types of water bodies, i.e., urban inside water bodies, urban outside discrete water bodies and large water bodies are identified according to their relative spatial relationships with built-up areas. The climate adaptive landscape characteristics of water bodies are analyzed based on water bodies' cooling effect (WCE) inside and outside cities in the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake regions. Seventy-three Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images acquired from 1989 to 2019 are employed. Landscape scale characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies are described by area, water depth, perimeter to area ratio (PARA) and distance-weighted area index (DWAI). Three temperature-related parameters are calculated to estimate the WCE in different conditions. Climate adaptive characteristics of water bodies inside/outside cities are determined by corre-lation and regression analysis. Results show that: 1) The long river shape, depth, orientation and fluidity of urban inside water bodies are benefit to enhance their cooling effect; 2) the distance of urban outside water bodies from built-up areas are positive correlated with their cooling effect; 3) the optimal acreage of large water bodies are >2500 km2 and 1111-1287.5 km2 for climate adaption of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, respectively. Simultaneously, the WCE of urban outside large water bodies is related with human activities and climate conditions.

"Flood Hazard In Wadi Rahbaa Area, Egypt","In the last decade, attention has been devoted to the southern part of the Egyptian Red Sea coast due to the large touristic and mining activities. Egypt spares no effort to develop it, to build new urban communities, and to create new job opportunities. Many comprehensive planning studies have been conducted. Many luxurious tourist spots, airports, and harbors have been constructed. These areas are subjected to flash floods, which represent a frequent threat to these urbanization activities that may cause losses in livelihood. By analyzing the geomorphologic features of the study area, intense stream networks are detected that, with the available metrological data, require flood management and analysis to mitigate the possible negative effects and to benefit from the estimation of flood water. Rahbaa basin is a sub-catchment of wadi Hodin. Flash floods within this area threaten the Red Sea coastal plain as well as the main coastal roads.

Mapping Deciduous Broad-Leaved Forested Swamps Using Alos/Palsar Data,"Accurate, updated information on the distribution of wetlands is essential for estimating net fluxes of greenhouse gases and for effectively protecting and managing wetlands. Because of their complex community structure and rich surface vegetation, deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps are considered to be one of the most difficult types of wetland to classify. In this research, with the support of remote sensing and geographic information system, multi-temporal radar images L-Palsar were used initially to extract the forest hydrological layer and phenology phase change layer as two variables through image analysis. Second, based on the environmental characteristics of forested swamps, three decision tree classifiers derived from the two variables were constructed to explore effective methods to identify deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps. Third, this study focused on analyzing the classification process between flat-forests, which are the most severely disturbed elements, and forested swamps. Finally, the application of the decision tree model will be discussed. The results showed that: 1) L-HH band (a L band with wavelength of 0-235 m in HH polarization mode; HH means Synthetic Aperture Radars transmit pulses in horizontal polarization and receive in horizontal polarization) in the leaf-off season is shown to be capable of detecting hydrologic conditions beneath the forest; 2) the accuracy of the classification (forested swamp and forest plat) was 81.5\% based on hydrologic features, and 83.5\% was achieved by combining hydrologic features and phenology response features, which indicated that hydrological characteristics under the forest played a key role. The HHOJ (refers to the band created by the subtraction with HH band in October and HH band in July) achieved by multi-temporal radar images did improve the classification accuracy, but not significantly, and more leaf-off radar images may be more efficient than multi-seasonal radar images for inland forested swamp mapping; 3) the lower separability between forested swamps dominated by vegetated surfaces and forest plat covered with litter was the main cause of the uncertainty in classification, which led to misleading interpretations of the pixel-based classification. Finally, through the analysis with kappa coefficients, it was shown that the value of the intersection point was an ideal choice for the variable.",2016,"{""Bian Hongfeng"",""He Chunguang"",""Sheng Lianxi"",""Yan Tingting"",""Zhang Zhengxiang""}",10.1007/s11769-016-0805-2,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Urban Photogrammetric Data Base For Multi-Purpose Cadastral-Based Information Systems: The Riyadh City Case,"Urban information systems are economic resources that can benefit decision makers in the planning, development, and management of urban projects and resources. In this research, a conceptual model-based prototype Urban Geographic Information System (UGIS) is developed. The base maps used in developing the system and acquiring visual attributes are obtained from aerial photographs. The system is a multi-purpose parcel-based one that can serve many urban applications such as public utilities, health centres, schools, population estimation, road engineering and maintenance, and many others. A modern region in the capital city of Saudi Arabia is used for the study. The developed model is operational for one urban application (population estimation) and is tested for that particular application. The results showed that the system has a satisfactory accuracy and that it may well be promising for other similar urban applications in countries with similar demographic and social characteristics. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

A Review Of The Impact Of Cybersecurity In High-Risk Medical Devices And In-Vitro Medical Devices All Over The World,"In modern healthcare systems, medical devices are playing a major role which involves personalized medical devices which improve the patient's lifestyle as they can be remotely monitored and their data are transmissible. Due to these data transmissions, the number of connections to the existing computer networks is increased. Being interoperable and interconnected these personalized medical devices provide great benefits like improved sensing capabilities and actuating capabilities. But the problem with high connectivity computer networks is that it exposes medical device to high cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The main targets are the pacemakers and institutions like hospitals and clinics. Hackers can easily hack medical devices and change prescriptions. So a cybersecurity breach can leak a patient's sensitive and confidential data and risk the patient's life. To prevent these multifaceted problems from happening these problems must be viewed from a systematic perspective and requires governance, technical controls, regulation, and standards.

Statistical Modeling Of Extreme Precipitation With Trmm Data,"This paper improves upon an existing extreme precipitation monitoring system that is based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) daily product (3B42) using new statistical models. The proposed system utilizes a regional modeling approach in which data from similar locations are pooled to increase the quality of the resulting model parameter estimates to compensate for the short data record. The regional analysis is divided into two stages. First, the region defined by the TRMM measurements is partitioned into approximately 28 000 nonoverlapping clusters using a recursive k-means clustering scheme. Next, a statistical model is used characterize the extreme precipitation events occurring in each cluster. Instead of applying the block maxima approach used in the existing system, in which the generalized extreme value probability distribution is fit to the annual precipitation maxima at each site separately, the present work adopts the peak-over-threshold method of classifying points as extreme if they exceed a prespecified threshold. Theoretical considerations motivate using the point process framework for modeling extremes. The fitted parameters are used to estimate trends and to construct simple and intuitive average recurrence interval (ARI) maps that reveal how rare a particular precipitation event is. This information could be used by policy makers for disaster monitoring and prevention. The new method eliminates much of the noise that was produced by the existing models because of a short data record, producing more reasonable ARI maps when compared with NOAA's long-term Climate Prediction Center ground-based observations. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied to other extreme climate records. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.",2018,"{""Demirdjian, L."",""Huffman, G.

Recent Ogallala Aquifer Region Drought Conditions As Observed By Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies From Grace,"Recent severe drought events have occurred over the Ogallala Aquifer region (OAR) during the period 2011–2015, creating significant impacts on water resources and their use in regional environmental and economic systems. The changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS), as indicated by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), reveals a detailed picture of the temporal and spatial evolution of drought events. The observations by GRACE indicate the worst drought conditions occurred in September 2012, with an average TWS deficit of ~8 cm in the northern OAR and ~11 cm in the southern OAR, consistent with precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project. Comparing changes in TWS with precipitation shows the TWS changes can be predominantly attributable to variations in precipitation. Power spectrum and squared wavelet coherence analysis indicate a significant correlation between TWS change and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and the influence of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures on TWS change is much stronger in the southern OAR than the northern OAR. The results of this study illustrate the value of GRACE in not just the diagnosis of significant drought events, but also in possibly improving the predictive power of remote signals that are impacted by nonregional climatic events (El Nino), ultimately leading to improved water resource management applications on a regional scale.

Minimizing Signal Detection Time In Postmarket Sequential Analysis: Balancing Positive Predictive Value And Sensitivity,"Purpose: Outcome misclassification in retrospective epidemiologic analyses has been well-studied, but little is known about such misclassification with respect to sequential statistical analysis during surveillance of medical product-associated risks, a planned capability of the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System. Methods: Using a vaccine example, we model and simulate sequential database surveillance in an observational data network using a variety of outcome detection algorithms. We consider how these algorithms, as characterized by sensitivity and positive predictive value, impact the length of surveillance and timeliness of safety signal detection. We show investigators/users of these networks how they can perform preparatory study design calculations that consider outcome misclassification in sequential database surveillance. Results: Non-differential outcome misclassification generates longer surveillance times and less timely safety signal detection as compared with the case of no misclassification. Inclusive algorithms characterized by high sensitivity but low positive predictive value outperform more narrow algorithms when detecting rare outcomes. This decision calculus may change considerably if medical chart validation procedures were required. Conclusions: These findings raise important questions regarding the design of observational data networks used for pharmacovigilance. Specifically, there are tradeoffs involved when choosing to populate such networks with component databases that are large as compared with smaller integrated delivery system databases that can more easily access laboratory or clinical data and perform medical chart validation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2014,"{""Brown, J.

Temporal And Phenological Profiles Of Open And Dense Caatinga Using Remote Sensing: Response To Precipitation And Its Irregularities,"Caatinga is a typical biome of Brazil's semiarid regions and subject to climate changes. Research is needed on the relation of its features to climate events. This study analyzed the influence of rainfall and its irregularities in open and dense woody Caatinga vegetation. Phenological curves were generated by means of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time profiles in the Grota do Angico Conservation Unit study area in Sergipe State. Rainfall data from 2000 to 2018 were collected and phenological curves generated using various estimate methods that produced the following variables: {[}start of season, end of season, peak of season position, length of season, mean growing season and maximum seasonal]. Rainfall showed a standard intra-annual behavior, with inter-annual variations related to irregularities influencing Caatinga response. Dense Caatinga vegetation had higher values of NDVI in all periods, even in anomalous years compared to open Caatinga, in addition to having longer leaf coverage over the year, with an anticipated start and a more extended seasonal end. The analysis of the rainfall regime made it possible to assess its influence on the Caatinga and phenological profiles proved to be fundamental to understand periods of physiological change of open and dense Caatinga. These results indicate that dense Caatinga maintains physiological activity longer, which may be associated with greater moisture maintenance in a semiarid region. In addition, because it has a greater leaf cover for longer periods, the soil may be preserved and maintain its characteristics longer, reducing the effects of desertification. The results may be associated with the type of forest management and conservation in this region. The total or partial suppression of individual remnants of Caatinga should be avoided, since the most open areas have lower photosynthetic capacity, affected to a considerable extent from the effects of adverse climatic conditions. Additionally, open Caatinga has a reduced capacity for regenerating naturally and its use by communities in this semiarid region should be limited.",2021,"{""Barreto, Ikaro Daniel de Carvalho"",""Hillebrand, Fernando Luis"",""Kuplich, Tatiana Mora"",""da Rosa, Cristiano Niederauer"",""de Jesus, Janisson Batista""}",10.1007/s11676-020-01145-3,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Cutaneous Melanoma In The Elderly,"The aim of this review was to analyze the difficulties in diagnosing and treating elderly patients with cutaneous melanoma. It focused on the main causes for late diagnosis and relatively poor prognosis in these patients. Early detection of melanoma is vital to reduce mortality in these patients and surgery is often curative. Adequate treatment of elderly patients with melanoma requires knowledge of the clinical features and histopathology of the disease, and the therapeutic options. This review also examined the main surgical procedures for primary melanoma and regional lymph node staging, and the curative and palliative procedures indicated for those elderly patients with advanced disease. It is expected that several molecular genetic factors will soon provide further prognostic information of possible benefit for elderly patients with melanoma.

Ecological Risk Pattern Based On Land Use Changes In Jiangsu Coastal Areas,"In order to assess ecological risk caused by land use changes in a region with a rapidly developing economy, based on remote sensing data of land use in Jiangsu coastal areas in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015, this study analyzed the land use changes and its transformation, quantitatively supported by Geographic Information System(GIS). The present study built an ecological risk index based on the landscape disturbance index and vulnerability index, and then the spatial and temporal dynamic changes of landscape ecological risk were quantitatively evaluated using geostatistical analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results showed that the ecological security of Jiangsu coastal areas had improved, and the average ecological risk value of the entire region decreased from 0.1563 in 1990 to 0.1529 in 2015. In the last 25 years, the moderate ecological risk level covered the largest area of the study region; the higher ecological risk level was mainly distributed in the cultivated land of the southwestern region and the waters of the western region of the study area, and its area decreased. Grade reduction zones of ecological risk were mainly concentrated in the higher ecological risk area, moderate ecological risk area, and lower ecological risk area. Meanwhile, grade increase zones of ecological risk were mainly concentrated in the lower ecological risk area and moderate ecological risk area, that is, the grassland and waters of the eastern region of the study area and the cultivated land of the southwestern region. The rapid development of the port industry and new coastal town resulted in the intensification of land use change, which damaged the balance of the ecosystems. The overall spatial difference of ecological risk in the study area had increased, showing the high-high aggregation and low-low aggregation in the local area. The area of high value primarily aggregated gathered south along the western boundary of the study area, and the low value aggregation region was largely distributed in the northeast of the study area and the eastern coastal areas. In addition, arable land, waterbodies, and construction land were the main sources of ecological risk in the study area. The results of the present study could provide a scientific theoretical basis and reliable technical support for the realization of land sustainable utilization, promoting the coordinated development of land use and environment protection, and the policy making of ecological risk management. © 2018 Science Press.

Grazing Influences Biomass Production And Protein Content Of Alpine Meadows,"Alpine grasslands are essential for carbon sequestration and food supply for domestic and wild herbivores inhabiting mountainous areas worldwide. These biomes, however, are alternatively threatened by the abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices leading to a fast-growing shrubification process while other mountain grasslands are suffering from the impacts of overgrazing. The functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems is primarily driven by climatic conditions, land-use legacies and grazing. However, although it is critically important, the role of large herbivores on the aboveground biomass and protein content of palatable plants is poorly understood for most alpine meadows. In this work, we explore the effects of grazing on grassland vegetation at two different spatial and temporal scales in the Eastern Pyrenees, Spain. Remote sensing was used to assess the effect of high and moderate grazing (HG and MG respectively) on grass biomass using the leaf area index (LAI) at the meso-scale (patches between 2.3 and 38.7 ha). We also explored the impact of null (NG), overgrazing (MO, mimicked overgrazing) and high (HG) grazing intensities at local scale setting eighteen 1 m2 exclusion boxes in six meadows (three boxes each) commonly used by domestic and wild ungulates. Historical satellite data showed that LAI values are greater in high than in low grazed areas (HG, mean = 0.66, LG, mean = 0.55). Along the same lines, high and moderate grazing pressures improved biomass production at the local-scale (HG, mean = 590.3 g/m(2), MO, mean = 389.3 g/m(2) and NG, mean = 110.8 g/m(2)). Crude protein content reached higher values under MO pressure than under HG pressure. Our results confirm that grazing intensity exerts significant changes on the above-ground biomass production and the protein content of plants consumed by domestic (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (Southern Chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica). We can conclude that ungulates sustain biomass and nutritive values of grass exerting a negligible effect on biomass and protein content of woody vegetation. Our results will inform management guidelines to support profitable grazing activities and promote conservation of the open landscapes in the alpine ecosystems under the current global change scenario.",2022,"{""Albanell, Elena"",""Bartolome, Jordi"",""Calleja, Juan Antonio"",""Colom-Cadena, Andreu"",""Espunyes, Johan"",""Fernandez-Aguilar, Xavier"",""Galvez-Ceron, Arturo"",""Gasso, Diana"",""Ibanez, Miguel"",""Jarque-Bascunana, Laia"",""Krumins, Jennifer Adams"",""Lopez-Martin, Josep Maria"",""Serrano, Emmanuel"",""Villamuelas, Miriam""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151771,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Development Of A Low Cost, Gps-Based Upgrade To A Standard Handheld Gamma Detector For Mapping Environmental Radioactive Contamination","A low cost extension to a standard handheld radiation monitor was developed, allowing one to perform outdoor georeferenced gamma measurements. It consists of a commercial wireless Bluetooth® GPS receiver, a commercial RS-232 to Bluetooth® converter combined with a standard Bluetooth® enabled pocket personal computer (PPC). The system is intended for use in difficult to access areas, typically for foot campaigns. As the operator walks, a straightforward homemade visual basic program alternately reads GPS position and gamma dose rate into the PPC, creating a data log. This allows a single operator on foot to map between 50 and 200 ha of environmental radiation per day in very rugged areas, depending on the accessiblity of the terrain and the detail required. On a test field with known contamination, a spatial precision of about 5-10 m was obtainable.

Using Gis To Develop A Model For Forest Fire Risk Mapping,"Forests are the most beautiful natural resources around the world and play a pivotal role in preserving environmental balance. An important measure taken for managing and protecting forest areas as well as for decreasing the potential damages caused by the fire is the detection of regions susceptible to forest fire through forest fire risk mapping with different models and methods. In recent years, a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) have been successfully applied in the production of forest fire risk maps. In this study, GIS-based analytical network process as MCDA method was employed in order to provide the fire risk map of Noshahr Forests (North Iran) using slope, slope aspect, altitude, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index, annual rainfall, annual temperature, distance to settlements, and distance to road as input data. Furthermore, to prepare the map of the distribution of occurred fires, MODIS fire product and wide-field observations were used. Thereafter, each of these subcriteria of the utilized factors was standardized according to their significance in a forest fire and then with the extracted coefficients in the analytical network process model merged in ArcGIS software. Finally, the fire risk map was generated. Evaluation of the results obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the designed model has good accuracy with a value of under curve area of 0.783. According to the map prepared, 57.45% of the study area (1034.41 km2) is located in the high and very high-risk classes. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",NA,NA,10.1007/s12524-019-00981-z,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
A Supply-Demand Model Of Vegetation Cooling For Urban Heatwave Mitigation,"The tradeoff between heatwave-induced human health risks and vegetation heat mitigation benefits is critical for mitigating heatwave hazards in urban regions. Currently, the heat risk study often focuses on the severity of heat risk to human health while the vegetation cooling is often ignored. Here, we proposed a new supply-demand matching model combining the vegetation cooling supply with the cooling demand induced by the high temperature. The cooling demand was assessed based on a heat exposure, population exposure, and heat vulnerability. The vegetation cooling supply was calculated by using a remote sensing-driven evapotranspiration (ET) model. Results showed: (1) The supply-demand matching model can identify cooling supply-demand mismatch zones in urban areas. (2) The vegetation ET model based on remote sensing can better represent the cooling benefits of vegetation compared to the vegetation abundance such as NDVI; (3) There was a special cluster of heat risk and cooling supply-demand mismatch in blocks of Beijing. The cooling supply and demand comparison model can inform vegetation-based intervention measures and urban planning guidelines for heat risk management.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101699,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
New Methods For Studying The Spatiotemporal Variation Of Snow Cover Based On Combination Products Of Modis Terra And Aqua,"Based on multi-day combination of Terra and Aqua MODIS snow cover products (cloud cover less than 10\%), this study developed new snow cover index (SCI), snow-covered duration/days (SCD) map, snow cover onset dates (SCOD) map and snow cover melting dates (SCMD) map, one each per hydrological year, to further examine the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover. Daily in situ snow depth observations in northern Xinjiang, China from 2001 to 2005 were used to validate the new maps. Our results indicate that the SCD maps had an overall agreement of 90\% with in situ observations of snow cover days at 20 stations in the study area, and the SCOD and SCMD maps also had good agreements with the in situ measurements, with a mean value of 1 week forward shift and 1 week back-ward shift, respectively, due to transient snowfall events in early fall and in late spring. The snow cover index (SCI) (km(2) day), first proposed here, contains both snow cover duration and extent for 1 hydrological year and indicates that the 2001-2002 hydrologic year had the most snow cover while the 2005-2006 had the least. While the SCD map provides the snow cover duration/days of each pixel in a hydrologic year, the SCOD and SCMD maps give specific dates when the snow cover begins and when it melts away at the pixel. Together, SCD, SCI, SCOD and SCMD can provide crucial information on spatiotemporal variation of snow cover conditions for any region of interest. This could potentially be critical information for local water agencies for planning water use and for mitigating snow-caused disaster. Long term availability of MODIS type of snow cover data for producing such datasets is key to study the connection between snow cover change and global climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Developments In Organ Preserving Treatments For Renal Cell Cancer: Open Surgery,"Recent trends in cancer surgery have shown that the same cure rates can be achieved with more organ and tissue sparing techniques and multimodal approaches. Developments in technology and better patient care now render most operations to be possible. In the past radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) used to save many lives because most of the patients were presenting at advanced stages. Thanks to modern imaging techniques and health awareness of the public, today, most of the patients are presenting with small incidentally detected renal masses. Apart from patients requiring organ preservation for absolute and relative indications, most patients today are enjoying the benefits of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in an elective setting. The crucial step in NSS is to get control of the renal vessels first and to expose the whole kidney to look for satellite cortical lesions. A safe rim of healthy tissue has to be removed together with the tumor. All bleeders are sutured, and if the collecting system is entered, it should be repaired. The parenchyma is sutured for approximation with absorbable sutures. The long term results with NSS show acceptable oncological outcome. The rate of complications of NSS has dramatically decreased with better patient selection, improved techniques and better management. All patients should be informed of the complications, recurrence rates and follow-up conditions. The advances in laparoscopic techniques now render NSS possible in selected patients. However, this is an extremely challenging operation, and can only be performed in expert hands. New technology is also emerging utilizing new forms of energy for tumor destruction and ultimately for nephron sparing approaches in localized RCC. As we are detecting more small renal masses, some of which are benign, NSS will remain to be the treatment of choice for these patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Linking Critical Zone With Watershed Science: The Example Of The Heihe River Basin,"Watersheds are the basic unit of Earth's terrestrial systems and are therefore ideal units for the study of critical zones (CZs). However, grand challenges remain regarding the observation, modeling, and management of CZs and watershed systems. We synthesize the progress and breakthroughs associated with watershed science and CZ research in the Heihe River basin (HRB), a large-scale endorheic river basin with unique mountain cryosphere-oasis-desert landscapes and prominent human-nature competition for water resources. The HRB observation system consists of mountain cryosphere, agricultural oasis, and natural oasis observatories and is promoted by large-scale comprehensive experiments to achieve multiscale observations. A watershed system model that couples ecohydrological models with socioeconomic models is developed to investigate the complex interactions among water, ecology, and socioeconomics in the HRB. The model is embedded in a decision support system to bridge science and decision-making and to better serve river basin sustainability. Significant progress and breakthroughs have been made in CZ and watershed process research (e.g., cryospheric hydrological processes, ecological and hydrological interactions, and surface-groundwater interactions) in the HRB. Nevertheless, observation and modeling of geochemical and geomorphological processes in the CZ have not been well addressed in integrated watershed studies of the HRB. In the future, new observation technologies, agent-based models, machine learning, and data assimilation will benefit both watershed science and CZ science and help to address complexity and dynamics in the CZ at the river basin scale. Overall, the HRB has successfully demonstrated how an experimental river basin can link CZ science with watershed science.",2022,"{""Che, Tao"",""Cheng, Guodong"",""Fu, Bojie"",""Kang, Shaozhong"",""Li, Xiaoyan"",""Li, Xin"",""Li, Xiubin"",""Liu, Shaomin"",""Ran, Youhua"",""Song, Changqing"",""Wang, Haibo"",""Xia, Jun"",""Yang, Dawen"",""Zhang, Ling"",""Zheng, Chunmiao"",""Zheng, Yi"",""Zhou, Yanzhao""}",10.1029/2022ef002966,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Effects Of Long-Term Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Ecosystem Service Values: An Example From The Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia","Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the world. The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs). Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. Additionally, the study facilitated the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs in the Central Rift Valley. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1973 and 2020 using four Landsat images from 1973, 1990, 2005 and 2020. The value transfer valuation method was used to estimate the changes in ESVs due to LULC changes. Among the seven major identified LULC classes, farmlands, settlements, and bare lands showed positive changes, while forestlands, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the last 47 years. The expansion of farmlands, for example, has occurred at the expense of grasslands, forestlands and shrublands. The changes in LULC over a period of 47 years resulted in a total loss of US \$62,110.4 x 10(6) in ESVs. The contributors to the overall loss of ESVs in decreasing order are provisioning services (US \$33,795.1 x 10(6)), cultural services (US \$28,981.5 x 10(6)) and regulating services (US \$652.9 x 10(6)). The results imply that addressing the degradation of land and water resources is crucial to reversing the loss of ecosystem services and achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG 15).",NA,NA,10.3390/land10121373,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Improved Understanding Of Vegetation Dynamics And Wetland Ecohydrology Via Monthly Uav-Based Classification,"Vegetation classification is an essential prerequisite for understanding vegetation-water relations at a range of spatial scales. However, in site-specific applications, such classifications were mostly based on a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight, which can be challenging in grasslands and/or herbaceous-dominated systems, as those communities are small in size and highly mixed. Here, we conducted monthly UAV flights for two years in a riparian wetland in Germany, with acquired imagery used for vegetation classification on a monthly basis under different strategies (with or without auxiliary information from other flights) to increase understanding in ecohydrology. The results show that multi-flight-based classification outperformed single-flight-based classification due to the higher classification accuracy. Moreover, improved sensitivity of temporal changes in community distribution highlights the benefits of multi-flight-based classification - providing a more comprehensive picture of community evolution. From reference to the monthly community distribution, we argue that a combination of two or three flights in early- and late-summer is enough to achieve comparable results to monthly flights, while mid-summer would be a better timing in case only one flight is scheduled. With such detailed vegetation mapping, we further interpreted the complex spatio-temporal heterogeneity in NDVI and explored the dominant areas and developmental progress of each community. Impacts from management (mowing events) were also evaluated based on the different responses between communities in two years. Finally, we explored how such vegetation mapping could help understand landscape ecohydrology, and found that the spatio-temporal distribution of minimal soil moisture was related to NDVI peaks of local community, while grass distribution was explained by both topography and low moisture conditions. Such bi-directional relationships proved that apart from contributing to an evidence base for wetland management, multi-flight UAV vegetation mapping could also provide fundamental insights into the ecohydrology of wetlands. © 2023 The Authors.

Ecological Conditions Influence Sentinel Decisions,"Ecological conditions can influence decisions relating to antipredator behaviour through impacts on the likelihood of detecting predators and the ability to hear vocalizations. Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

Inclusive Development And Prioritization Of Review Questions In A Highly Controversial Field Of Regulatory Science,"How to best assess potential health, environmental and other impacts of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and how to interpret the resulting evidence base have been long-standing controversial issues in the EU. As a response, transparency and inclusiveness became a major focus of regulatory science activities in the GMO impact area. Nevertheless, nearly three decades of controversies resulted in a heavily polarized policy environment, calling for further efforts. Against this backdrop the EU funded project GRACE explored the value of evidence synthesis approaches for GMO impact assessment and developed an evidence synthesis framework with a strong emphasis on openness, stakeholder engagement, transparency, and responsiveness to tackle regulatory science challenges. This framework was tested and implemented in the course of 14 systematic reviews or maps conducted on selected review questions spanning potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of GMOs. An inclusive development and pri-oritisation of review questions is of key importance in evidence synthesis as it helps to provide a better link between stakeholder demands and concerns and policy relevant outcomes. This paper, therefore, places a particular focus on the stakeholder involvement strategy developed and experiences gathered during this particular step in the course of the GRACE project. Based on this experience, possible lessons for future engagement exercises in highly controversial fields of regulatory science are discussed.",NA,NA,10.1186/s13750-017-0113-z,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Fine Identification And Biomass Estimation Of Mangroves Based On Uav Multispectral And Lidar,"Mangroves are special types of woody plants that grow exclusively in the intertidal zones of the tropics and the subtropics. With respect to environmental and ecological values, mangroves protect the shoreline from tides, winds, and storms and act as the first line of defense against extreme weather in coastal areas. Moreover, mangroves have a continuous carbon fixation capacity, which is much higher than those of peat swamp and coastal salt marsh. Mangroves are an important part of the earth carbon cycle system and considered an important blue carbon sink on the sea and land margin. However, mangrove habitat is threatened all over the world due to human development and utilization activities. Therefore, monitoring the spatial distribution of mangrove types and biomass will help guide policy-makers in taking effective utilization and protection measures. In this paper, on the basis of UAV multispectral images and LiDAR point cloud data, the support vector machine classification method is used for mangrove identification. Furthermore, mangrove species are distinguished according to different heights and distribution areas using the elevation information in the UAV LiDAR point cloud data. The structure characteristics of mangrove single wood are extracted by the point-cloud-based cluster segmentation method, and an estimation model of the tree height, canopy, and aboveground biomass obtained by LiDAR remote sensing is constructed, Finally, the aboveground biomass of mangrove in the study area is calculated, and its spatial distribution information is analyzed. The classification result of the species types of mangroves, which is combined with the multi spectrum and LiDAR point cloud data, can reach 90.69% in total accuracy. The kappa coefficient is 0.88. The accuracies of the algorithm in identifying single trees of Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculata are 86.71% and 60.21%, respectively. Among them, the middle errors of the heights of K. candel and A. corniculata are 0.36 and 0.18 m, respectively, and the crown width extraction precision of K. candel is higher than that of A. corniculata. The regression models of the aboveground biomass of K. candel and A. corniculata are constructed. The accuracy of the fusion model is the highest, and the respective decision coefficients (R²) are 0.678 and 0.832 for K. candel and A. corniculata. Mangroves are mostly planted artificially in the study area and distributed in a belt perpendicular to the dam: K. candel—Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Acanthus ilicifolius L. —A. corniculata. The area of A. corniculata is the largest, which is approximately 8.91 hm2 and distributed on both sides of the tidal ditch far from the dam. The area of K. candel is 4.69 hm2, which is distributed in the area near the dam. C. malaccensis Lam. and A. ilicifolius L. are scattered in small areas among the different types of objects. The aboveground biomass of mangrove is calculated by the estimation model of above ground biomass. The aboveground biomass follows the order Sonneratia apetala > A. corniculata > C. malaccensis Lam. > K. candel > A. ilicifolius L. The distribution range of mangrove’s aboveground biomass is 1.24—3.6 kg/m2 © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

"Assessment Of Vegetation Status Of Sali River Basin, A Tributary Of Damodar River In Bankura District, West Bengal, Using Satellite Data","Vegetation status of Sali River basin has been evaluated in this study applying the Landsat 8 data. Here, NDVI, EVI, GI, LAI, PVI, SI, BI and NDMI have been used to assess vegetation status (VS). Indices have been classified into five categories following natural breaks classification method. Apart from BI, all the indices represented higher value in forest cover area. Weights for all the themes and sub-themes were assigned following multi-criteria decision analysis with consistency ratio of 0.0685, and weighted overlay analysis technique had been employed for the assessment of the vegetation status. Very low, low and moderate VS was found mainly over the water body, urban and agricultural area, which is covering more than half of the basin. The rest of the area is covered with high and very high VS, representing fragmented and dense Sal forest and covering 15.81\% and 22.88\% basin area, respectively. Accuracy assessment and thorough field verification were done with 90.43\% classification accuracy. Our result is quite similar to land use land cover map of Bhuvan, ISRO.

Forecasting Models For Surface Water Quality Using Predictive Analytics,"Modeling surface water quality has become crucial in providing better strategies for managing surface water resources, and adequate findings need accurate and geographically dispersed data. Hydrogeological modeling of these data sets is possible using empirically-based models. The other statistical models are also an alternative approach. In this study, a process with maximum probability is considered with the help of machine learning tools (MLT) to have optimized and valid output. The proposed method combines remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS and GIS) and MLT, which are appropriate for the predicament of neither small, large scale, nor long-term simulations. MLT methods such as VAR and ARIMA are developed in the Python programming with Jupyter notebook and tested according to the data in the spatial prediction for surface water quality parameters such as Tr, pH, Ec, TDS, AL, Ca++, NO3-, So, Cl, F-, Fe, and Mg2+ in the Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India-lower delta part. The delta with susceptible zones was identified using RS and GIS as those areas are prone to direct exposure to surface water contaminants from aquaculture, agricultural runoff, small- and medium-scale businesses, and household trash. Achieving effective surface water management for this ecosystem is critical for regional water management. The geographical information about the concentrations acquired via the RS and GIS was compared to the statistical modeling findings and verified using real-time measurements. MLT modeling seems more realistic than the experimental setting; data from the previous 20 years (2000-2020) were used for modeling, and the predicted values presented in the paper are predicted for the year 2021. The computed R-2 value of ranges between 0.75 and 0.96\% is recorded with ARIMA, and VAR posted range between 0.56 and 0.75\% with the trained and tested data. The findings show the potential for MLT of geographically dispersed hydrogeological data to be used for pollution-free surface water management. From the surface water management perspective, combining RS and GIS and MLT offers an alternate data analysis approach for obtaining quick results utilizing a less laborious process that produces acceptable results.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10668-023-03280-3,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Peat Consumption And Carbon Loss Due To Smouldering Wildfire In A Temperate Peatland,"Temperate peatlands represent a substantial store of carbon and their degradation is a potentially significant positive feedback to climate change. The ignition of peat deposits can cause smouldering wildfires that have the potential to release substantial amounts of carbon and to cause environmental damage from which ecosystem recovery can be slow. Direct estimates of the loss of carbon due to smouldering wildfires are needed to inform global estimates of the effect of wildfire on carbon dynamics and to aid with national emissions accounting. We surveyed the effect of a severe wildfire that burnt within an afforested peatland in the Scottish Highlands during the summer of 2006. The fire ignited layers of peat which continued to burn as a sub-surface smouldering wildfire for more than a month after the initial surface fire and despite several episodes of heavy rain. The smouldering fire perimeter enclosed an area of 4.1 ha. Analysis of weather records showed that the fire coincided with unusually warm, dry conditions and a period when the Canadian Fire Weather Index system predicted both generally high danger conditions (high Fire Weather Index) and low fuel moisture content in deep organic soil layers (high Drought Code values). Remaining peat layers in the burn area had comparatively low fuel moisture contents of ca. 250\% dry weight. Within the smouldering fire's perimeter, mean depth of burn was estimated at 17.5 +/- 2.0 cm but ranged from 1 to 54 cm. Based on field measurements, our estimates suggested that, in total, the smouldering wildfire burnt 773 +/- 120 t of organic matter corresponding to 396 +/- 63 t of carbon and a carbon loss per unit area burnt of 96 +/- 15 t ha(-1) (9.6 +/- 1.5 kg m(-2)). This corresponds to between 0.1\% and 0.3\% of the estimated total amount of carbon sequestered annually by UK peatlands. Our results also provide circumstantial evidence that afforestation of peatland soils, and associated site preparation, may contribute to an increased risk of peat fires. Smouldering fires are difficult to detect using remotely sensing techniques due to their low temperature and low heat release and the fact that the tree canopy remains intact for months afterwards. If similar smouldering fires are underreported in other temperate, boreal and tropical peatland regions then emissions from peatland burning may well be a substantially greater issue than currently assumed.

Information Content Of In Situ And Remotely Sensed Chlorophyll-A: Learning From Size-Structured Phytoplankton Model,"Chlorophyll-a measurements in the form of in situ observations and satellite ocean colour products are commonly used in data assimilation to calibrate marine biogeochemical models. Here, a two size-class phytoplankton biogeochemical model, with a OD configuration, was used to simulate the surface chlorophyll-a dynamics (simulated surface Chl-a) for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies off East Australia. An optical model was then used to calculate the inherent optical properties from the simulation and convert them into remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). Subsequently, R-rs was used to produce a satellite-like estimate of the simulated surface Chl-a concentrations through the MODIS OC3M algorithm (simulated OC3M Chl-a). Identical parameter optimisation experiments were performed through the assimilation of the two separate datasets (simulated surface Chl-a and simulated OC3M Chl-a), with the purpose of investigating the contrasting information content of simulated surface Chl-a and remotely-sensed data sources. The results we present are based on the analysis of the distribution of a cost function, varying four parameters of the biogeochemical model. In our idealized experiments the simulated OC3M Chl-a product is a poor proxy for the total simulated surface Chl-a concentration. Furthermore, our result show the OC3M algorithm can underestimate the simulated chlorophyll-a concentration in offshore eddies off East Australia (Case I waters), because of the weak relationship between large-sized phytoplankton and remote-sensing reflectance. Although Case I waters are usually characteristic of oligotrophic environments, with a photosynthetic community typically represented by relatively small-sized phytoplankton, mesoscale features such as eddies can generate seasonally favourable conditions for a photosynthetic community with a greater proportion of large phytoplankton cells. Furthermore, our results show that in mesoscale features such as eddies, in situ chlorophyll-a observations and the ocean colour products can carry different information related to phytoplankton sizes. Assimilating both remote-sensing reflectance and measurements of in situ chlorophyll-a concentration reduces the uncertainty of the parameter values more than either data set alone, thus reducing the spread of acceptable solutions, giving an improved simulation of the natural environment.",2018,"{""Baird, Mark E."",""Doblin, Martina A."",""Laiolo, Leonardo"",""Matear, Richard"",""Soja-Wozniak, Monika""}",10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.03.005,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued""}"
Multi-Scale Model Analysis Of Boundary Layer Ozone Over East Asia,"This study employs the regional Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to examine seasonal and diurnal variations of boundary layer ozone (O-3) over East Asia. We evaluate the response of model simulations of boundary layer O-3 to the choice of chemical mechanisms, meteorological fields, boundary conditions, and model resolutions. Data obtained from surface stations, aircraft measurements, and satellites are used to advance understanding of O-3 chemistry and mechanisms over East Asia and evaluate how well the model represents the observed features. Satellite measurements and model simulations of summertime rainfall are used to assess the impact of the Asian monsoon on O-3 production. Our results suggest that summertime O-3 over Central Eastern China is highly sensitive to cloud cover and monsoonal rainfall over this region. Thus, accurate simulation of the East Asia summer monsoon is critical to model analysis of atmospheric chemistry over China. Examination of hourly summertime O-3 mixing ratios from sites in Japan confirms the important role of diurnal boundary layer fluctuations in controlling ground-level O-3. By comparing five different model configurations with observations at six sites, the specific mechanisms responsible for model behavior are identified and discussed. In particular, vertical mixing, urban chemistry, and dry deposition depending on boundary layer height strongly affect model ability to capture observed behavior. Central Eastern China appears to be the most sensitive region in our study to the choice of chemical mechanisms. Evaluation with TRACE-P aircraft measurements reveals that neither the CB4 nor the SAPRC99 mechanisms consistently capture observed behavior of key photochemical oxidants in springtime. However, our analysis finds that SAPRC99 performs somewhat better in simulating mixing ratios of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) at flight altitudes below 1 km. The high level of uncertainty associated with O-3 production in Central Eastern China poses a major problem for regional air quality management. This highly polluted, densely populated region would greatly benefit from comprehensive air quality monitoring and the development of model chemical mechanisms appropriate to this unique atmospheric environment.",NA,NA,10.5194/acp-9-3277-2009,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Tempo-Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment From The Perspective Of Human Engineering Activity,"The expansion of mountainous urban areas and road networks can influence the terrain, vegetation, and material characteristics, thereby altering the susceptibility of landslides. Understanding the relationship between human engineering activities and landslide occurrence is of great significance for both landslide prevention and land resource management. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the landslide caused by Typhoon Megi in 2016. A representative mountainous area along the eastern coast of China-characterized by urban development, deforestation, and severe road expansion-was used to analyze the spatial distribution of landslides. For this purpose, high-precision Planet optical remote sensing images were used to obtain the landslide inventory related to the Typhoon Megi event. The main innovative features are as follows: (i) the newly developed patch generating land-use simulation (PLUS) model simulated and analyzed the driving factors of land-use land-cover (LULC) from 2010 to 2060; (ii) the innovative stacking strategy combined three strong ensemble models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-to calculate the distribution of landslide susceptibility; and (iii) distance from road and LULC maps were used as short-term and long-term dynamic factors to examine the impact of human engineering activities on landslide susceptibility. The results show that the maximum expansion area of built-up land from 2010 to 2020 was 13.433 km(2), mainly expanding forest land and cropland land, with areas of 8.28 km(2 )and 5.99 km(2), respectively. The predicted LULC map for 2060 shows a growth of 45.88 km(2) in the built-up land, mainly distributed around government residences in areas with relatively flat terrain and frequent socio-economic activities. The factor contribution shows that distance from road has a higher impact than LULC. The Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM model obtained the optimal AUC value of 0.915 in the landslide susceptibility analysis in 2016. Furthermore, future road network and urban expansion have intensified the probability of landslides occurring in urban areas in 2015. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the PLUS and Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM models in landslide susceptibility analysis in international literature. The research results can serve as a foundation for developing land management guidelines to reduce the risk of landslide failures.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15164111,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Assessment Of Tropical Cyclone Rainfall From Gsmap And Gpm Products And Their Application To Analog Forecasting In The Philippines,"Tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall is both a resource and a hazard in the Philippines. Observation of its spatiotemporal distribution is necessary for water and disaster mitigation management. This study evaluated the performance of two high-resolution satellite precipitation datasets-the GSMaP and GPM-IMERG-in estimating accumulated TC rainfall in the Philippines from 2000 to 2021. TC rain is defined as rainfall within 5 degrees of a TC center. Several estimation algorithms were included in the assessment. The uncalibrated near-real-time GSMaP\_NRT and early version GPM\_ER, the reanalysis GSMaP\_RNL, and the gauge-calibrated GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G. The assessment shows the worst scores for the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT and GSMaP\_RNL, followed by GPM\_ER with station correlation coefficient (CC) values of 0.63, 0.67, and 0.73, respectively, compared to GSMaP\_G CC of 0.79 and GPM\_G CC of 0.77. GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G also gave the least bias and error, with a consistently high (>0.6) probability of detection (POD) and Pierce skill score (PSS) up to rainfall of 300 mm. In addition to the evaluation, the GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G were used in the analog forecasting of TC rain. Analog forecasting is based on the principle that past weather conditions can occur again. In TC rain analog forecasting, past TCs with similar intensities and tracks are assumed to bring similar rainfall amounts and distribution as a current TC. Composite mean TC rainfall from historical satellite precipitation estimations was produced to create TC rain forecasts. Results show the analog TC rain forecasts generally captured the spatial distribution of TC rain and performed better than the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT, with a mean station correlation of 0.62-0.67, POD greater than 0.7, and positive PSS indicating good skills. However, forecasts have a false alarm ratio greater than 0.8 for 150 mm rain and have difficulty producing extreme rainfall (>250 mm).",NA,NA,10.3390/atmos13091398,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
"A Comparative Study Of Urban Expansion In Beijing, Tianjin And Shijiazhuang Over The Past Three Decades","Detailed comparative studies on spatiotemporal patterns of both urbanized area and urban expansion over a relatively long timeframe are rare. Here, we compared spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in three major cities (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang) in the Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration using multi-temporal Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ images data of circa 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and landscape analysis approaches. A multi-scale analysis on the landscape responses to urban expansion from regional landscape to city and within city levels was performed. Results showed that urban area in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang has expanded from 801 km(2), 795 km(2) and 682 km(2) to 2452 km(2), 3343 km(2) and 1699 km(2), increasing annually at 3.7\%, 4.7\% and 3.2\%, respectively. Spatially, Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang have presented a mononuclear concentric polygon pattern, a double-nucleated polygon-line pattern, a sectorial point pattern, respectively, resulting primarily from their respective topographic constraints as well as urban planning and policy. Landscape responses to urban expansion varied with time and scale investigated, suggesting a general understanding on landscape metrics at regional or city level may fail to reveal detailed within city landscape dynamics under the impacts of urban expansion.

Potential Drivers Of Common Brusntail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Decline On A Murray River Floodplain,"Australia's terrestrial mammalian fauna have experienced severe declines since European settlement. On the Murray-Darling floodplain in south-eastern Australia, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, 'possums'), have contracted to riparian zones. Although an important possum refuge, little is known about possum population dynamics here. We examined possum population dynamics and potential drivers across two decades on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station. We related possum density to satellite derived fractional cover, (a measure of the proportion of green, non-green and bare ground cover), and contextualised these findings using tree condition and grazing pressure datasets. Possum surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2019 in riparian and non-riparian habitats and density was modelled in relation to fractional cover values of green, non-green, and bare ground. Possum density fluctuated between 1998 and 2008 but in 2018 and 2019, possums were undetectable. Possum density was negatively associated with bare ground and positively associated with non-green. Overgrazing by kangaroos likely reduced vegetation cover and diversity and contributed to possum decline, via a reduction in possum food resources and increased exposure to predation. Inconsistent monitoring meant that the population decline was not detected until after it had occurred, and management interventions were not triggered, highlighting the dilemma of allocating scarce monitoring resources.",2023,"{""Cale, P."",""Chaber, A."",""McKenzie, T."",""Neilly, H."",""Ward, M.""}",10.1071/am22004,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Land Use/Cover Changes In The Pra River Basin, Ghana","Pra River Basin, located in South Central Ghana, is a forest basin that is reported of being threatened with land degradation activities.

Landsat images, 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2018, were classified using the spectral angle mapping technique. Six land use classes were identified and classified, namely, closed forest, open forest, farm/grassland, settlement, mining, and water. The results showed that the basin has been experiencing changes in the spatial patterns and distribution of LULC classes. Generally, closed forest and open forest decreased with mean values of 10\% and 11\% respectively, towards settlement, farming, and mining which increased with mean values of 7.8\%, 12.4\%, and 1.0\% respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the change in land use classes varied across the sub-basins. Settlement increased consistently in all the sub-basins; however, Oda and Upper Ofin increased greatly towards peri-urban residential and commercial land uses. Similarly, illegal mining activities recorded severe increase in Anum, Birim, Lower Ofin, and Twifu Praso sub-basins. Farm/grassland increased specifically in Lower Pra, Assin Praso, Twifo Praso, Birim, and Upper Ofin sub-basins.

"Mapping Of Groundwater Potential Zones In Pohru Watershed Of Jhelum Basin-Western Himalaya, India Using Integrated Approach Of Remote Sensing, Gis And Ahp","There has been excessive use of groundwater resources owing to dwindling water resource potentialities across the globe. As a result, efficient water resource management has become inevitable. However, locating the groundwater potential zones in dry and mountainous regions of many developing countries which lack suitable economic and human resources is challenging. The integrated approach of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) can offer a solution to this problem as it is useful to fetch first-hand information and has wider applicability. The present study focuses on delineating of groundwater potential zones in Pohru Watershed, of Jhelum Basin-Western Himalaya, India by integrating RS, GIS and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Seven thematic layers, namely lithology, geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, slope, drainage density and lineament density have been used in this study. The parameters were weighted using AHP according to their importance in determining the groundwater potential. Five major groundwater potential zones were identified as: Very High (18.14\%), High (18.17\%), Moderate (19.03\%), Low (41.75\%) and Very Low (2.88\%). The findings reveal that High and Very High Potential Zones are concentrated in the alluvial plains and the adjoining fluvio-lacustrine deposits/ Karewas. However, the highly or moderately dissected hills and the mountain ridges mostly comprise of Low and Very Low groundwater potential zones. The residual hills comprise of Medium and Low groundwater potential zones.

Spatial Heterogeneity Evaluation And Zoning Of Production-Living-Ecological Space Based On Multi-Source Spatial Data,"Production-living-ecological space is a typical spatial carrier to coordinate economic, social, and ecological benefits. Its coordinated development has been greatly significant to promote the ecological civilization, even to optimize the spatial planning in land use. However, the spatial function differentiation is still lacking on the different plots in the same land type, particularly in the most current evaluation on the production-living-ecological space. The clustering or Coordination Degree (CD) is also less sufficient in production-living-ecological space. The purpose of this study is to improve the evaluation system of production-living-ecological space, further to partition its aggregation and coordination degree for the land-use spatial optimization. An integration of multi-source spatial data was implemented to evaluate the functions of production-living-ecological space in different plots with the same land from the grid scale, with emphasis on the perspective of spatial heterogeneity. A systematic analysis was then made on the spatial autocorrelation and trigonometric coordinates. As such, the clustering and coordination characteristics were revealed on the production-living-ecological space on the township scale. Zoning schemes were finally proposed for the optimization of land space. The results are as follows. 1) The high score areas of production space in Hainan Island were concentrated in the coastal cities and counties, indicating the distribution characteristics of ""higher around and lower in the middle, higher in the north and lower in the south"". There were also differences between the urban and rural production spaces. The high score areas of living space were mainly concentrated in the cities and counties, with the spatial pattern of ""small part gathering and most scattered"". The high score areas of ecological space were concentrated in the middle, with the distribution characteristics of ""higher in the middle and lower around"". 2) The Moran's I indexes for the production, life, and ecological space function were 0.569, 0.221 and 0.716, respectively, in Hainan Island obtained from the township scale. It inferred that there was the strongest spatial correlation between the spatial autocorrelation characteristics and ecological space. Therefore, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial clustering. 3) There were great differences in the coordination degree of production-living-ecological space in different towns of Hainan Island. The high value areas were dominated by ecological space and coordinated type, accounting for 51.72% and 43.97% of the total number of towns, respectively. The low value area was dominated by ecology space, accounting for 72.41% of the total number of towns, where no living dominant town was observed. In the case of spatial features, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial coordination. The heterogeneity of spatial functions was effectively identified in the production-living-ecological space for the different plots with the same land type. A specific scheme of production-living-ecological spatial zoning was also proposed from two new perspectives of spatial clustering and coordination degree, suitable for the current practice of land space optimization. An optimization path of production-living-ecological spatial evaluation can provide the zoning schemes, according to the spatial characteristics. The finding can offer a potential decision making for the land space optimization, as well as the construction of free trade port and ecological civilization in Hainan Island of southern China. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

"In Situ, Satellite Measurement And Model Evidence On The Dominant Regional Contribution To Fine Particulate Matter Levels In The Paris Megacity","A detailed characterization of air quality in the megacity of Paris (France) during two 1-month intensive campaigns and from additional 1-year observations revealed that about 70 % of the urban background fine particulate matter (PM) is transported on average into the megacity from upwind regions. This dominant influence of regional sources was confirmed by in situ measurements during short intensive and longer-term campaigns, aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from ENVISAT, and modeling results from PMCAMx and CHIMERE chemistry transport models. While advection of sulfate is well documented for other megacities, there was surprisingly high contribution from long-range transport for both nitrate and organic aerosol. The origin of organic PM was investigated by comprehensive analysis of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), radiocarbon and tracer measurements during two intensive campaigns. Primary fossil fuel combustion emissions constituted less than 20 % in winter and 40 % in summer of carbonaceous fine PM, unexpectedly small for a megacity. Cooking activities and, during winter, residential wood burning are the major primary organic PM sources. This analysis suggests that the major part of secondary organic aerosol is of modern origin, i.e., from biogenic precursors and from wood burning. Black carbon concentrations are on the lower end of values encountered in megacities worldwide, but still represent an issue for air quality. These comparatively low air pollution levels are due to a combination of low emissions per inhabitant, flat terrain, and a meteorology that is in general not conducive to local pollution build-up. This revised picture of a megacity only being partially responsible for its own average and peak PM levels has important implications for air pollution regulation policies. © Author(s) 2015.",2015,"{""Baklanov, A."",""Baltensperger, U."",""Beekmann, M."",""Beirle, S."",""Borbon, A."",""Borrmann, S."",""Bressi, M."",""Colomb, A."",""Crippa, M."",""Denier Van Der Gon, H.

Redd+: The Opportunity For Sustainable Management In Zagros Forests,"The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) projects aim to prevent deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions as a policy to combat climate changes. This article evaluates changes to the Zagros’ Forest cover in 20 years and predicts the implications of implementing the REDD+ project in the next two decades. Using Landsat Forest cover maps and a logistic regression model the potential for forest cover transfer to non-forest regions was modeled to identify regions at risk of deforestation. A Markov chain was implemented to predict the changes. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was employed for validation, and the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) was utilized to model the REDD+ project baseline to predict the forest cover changes. The findings indicate, 37,809 hectares of forest cover were lost in the past 20 years and with this trend, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions will increase. However, implementing the REDD+ project can prevent the release of 1,714,534.13 tCO2e. Therefore, this deteriorating forest possesses the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by preventing deforestation, identifying deforestation-prone areas and implementing the REDD+ project utilizing the methodology presented. Climate change mitigation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection are just a few of the benefits of REDD+ projects that can aid sustainable forest management. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.",2023,"{""Delpasand, S."",""Maleknia, R."",""Naghavi, H.""}",10.1080/10549811.2022.2130359,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Drought Monitoring Of The Wetland In The Tumen River Basin Between 1991 And 2016 Using Landsat Tm/Etm+,"Wetland areas are known as ‘the kidneys of the Earth’ because they provide important functions towards stabilizing the environment, long-term protection of water sources, effectively minimizing sediment loss, purifying surface water from industrial and agricultural pollutants, and enhancing aquifer recharge. The condition of water supply in wetlands directly affects the growth of wetland plants and local biodiversity. Therefore, drought monitoring is vital in wetlands. In this study, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) is used to observe the drought status of the wetland in the cross-border (China and North Korea) Tumen River Basin from 1991 to 2016. For this purpose, the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data for six periods were used for the analysis. Soil moisture maps acquired from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System Version 1.0 (CLDAS-V1.0) were then introduced for validating the reliability of the drought monitoring method. The results showed that most areas with a normal moisture level (decreased 25.8%) began experiencing slight drought (increased 29.7%). The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between VTCI and soil moisture showed values of 0.69, 0.32, and 0.2 for 0–5 cm, 0–10 cm, and 10–20 cm thicknesses, respectively. Although climate change probably contributes to the formation of drought by decreasing precipitation (50 mm decrease in Chinese section) and increasing temperature (0.5°C  increase in North Korean section), human activities such as surges in daily water consumption appear as the main threats that leading to droughts in this wetland. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,"{""Cui, G."",""Jeon, S.

Estimating Community-Level Plant Functional Traits In A Species-Rich Alpine Meadow Using Uav Image Spectroscopy,"Plant functional traits at the community level (plant community traits hereafter) are commonly used in trait-based ecology for the study of vegetation–environment relationships. Previous studies have shown that a variety of plant functional traits at the species or community level can be successfully retrieved by airborne or spaceborne imaging spectrometer in homogeneous, species-poor ecosystems. However, findings from these studies may not apply to heterogeneous, species-rich ecosystems. Here, we aim to determine whether unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imaging could adequately estimate plant community traits in a species-rich alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. To achieve this, we compared the performance of four non-parametric regression models, i.e., partial least square regression (PLSR), the generic algorithm integrated with the PLSR (GA-PLSR), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for the retrieval of 10 plant community traits using visible and near-infrared (450–950 nm) UAV hyperspectral imaging. Our results show that chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid content, starch content, specific leaf area and leaf thickness were estimated with good accuracies, with the highest R2 values between 0.64 (nRMSE = 0.16) and 0.83 (nRMSE = 0.11). Meanwhile, the estimation accuracies for nitrogen content, phosphorus content, plant height and leaf dry matter content were relatively low, with the highest R2 varying from 0.3 (nRMSE = 0.24) to 0.54 (nRMSE = 0.20). Among the four tested algorithms, the GA-PLSR produced the highest accuracy, followed by PLSR and XGBoost, and RF showed the poorest performance. Overall, our study demonstrates that UAV-based visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging has the potential to accurately estimate multiple plant community traits for the natural grassland ecosystem at a fine scale. © 2022 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14143399,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Annington Versus Deutsche Annington: Private Equity And Housing In The Anglo-Saxon And Rhenish Contexts,"Under the Rhenish model of capitalism the interests of other stake-holders than shareholders are essential to the interests of the firm. However, Rhenish institutions in Germany have been changing. In the housing sector, many organizations that promoted the provision of affordable housing are currently managed by private equity firms promoting shareholders' interests. This paper presents a dual case study on two housing providers: Annington in the UK, and Deutsche Annington in Germany which were owned by the same private equity investor, Terra Firma. The paper - based on this analysis of a single approach to the management of two comparable firms in the Rhenish and Anglo-Saxon contexts - considers the question of whether the Rhenish model is being swept away by the shareholders revolution. The paper concludes that this is not the case and that certain differences between these cases reflect the continuing differences between the Anglo-Saxon and Rhenish models of capitalism.",NA,NA,10.1080/14036096.2018.1479300,"{""terra firma"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
A Framework For Assessment Of Flood Conditions Using Hydrological And Hydrodynamic Modeling Approach,"River flooding has been triggering significant damage to lives and infrastructure and is a major worry all around the globe. To lessen these losses, proper planning and management methods need to be deployed. The purpose of this research is to fill a knowledge gap on the effects of reservoirs operation of the Idukki and Idamalyar to Periyar River Basin massive flooding. The proposed methodology is implemented on the Periyar River Basin located in Kerala, India, where severe flooding occurred during monsoon season in the year 2018. In this study, modelling technique has been used in two-step: (1) development of 1D physically based, distributed-parameter model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) to compute the stream flow and estimate the stream discharge at different outlet points; and (2) hybrid model is developed by linking SWAT with a well-known 2D hydrodynamic model (International River Interface Cooperative, iRIC) to display flood scenarios and to identify the flood-prone areas. The ArcSWAT user interface employed in the ArcGIS software was utilized to delineate the river basin. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated on daily and monthly basis at two gauge discharge stations, i.e., Neeleeswaram and Kalady. The statistical coefficients result obtained from SWAT model was in good agreement with the measured values for calibration and validation. The hybrid model simulation results compared with observed flood depth and remote sensing data demonstrated good capability of the model. Agreeable performances of computed results were observed in both flow fields and flood propagations. The result was compared with 2018 flood to check model accuracy and found to be satisfactory. The proposed framework can be utilized as an effective tool for efficient planning and management of natural disasters, such as flash floods. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/w15071371,"{""model not data""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"
"Forest, Wetland And Biodiversity: Revealing Multi-Faceted Ecological Services From Ecorestoration Of A Degraded Tropical Landscape","With the deterioration of tropical forests, the loss of species, their habitat and linked socio-ecological degradation is regrettably becoming widespread. Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

"Novel Variant Hendra Virus Genotype 2 Infection In A Horse In The Greater Newcastle Region, New South Wales, Australia","In October 2021, the first contemporary detection of Hendra virus genotype 2 (HeV-g2) was made by veterinary priority disease investigation in a horse near Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, as part of routine veterinary priority disease surveillance.This discovery followed an update of Hendra virus diagnostic assays following retrospective identification of this variant from 2015 via sentinel emerging in-fectious disease research, enabling timely detection of this case. The sole infected horse was euthanized in moribund condition. As the southernmost recognised HeV spill-over detection to date, it extends the southern limit of known cases by approximately 95 km. The event occurred near a large urban centre, characterised by equine populations of diverse type, husbandry, and purpose, with low HeV vaccination rates.Urgent multi-agency outbreak response involved risk assessment and monitoring of 11 exposed people and biosecurity management of at-risk animals. No human or additional animal cases were recognised.This One Health investigation highlights need for research on risk perception and strategic engagement to support owners confronted with the death of companion animals and potential human exposure to a high consequence virus. The location and timing of this spill-over event diverging from that established for prototype HeV (HeV-g1), highlight benefit in proactive One Health surveillance and research activities that improve understanding of dynamic transmission and spill-over risks of both HeV genotypic lineages and related but divergent emerging pathogens.",2022,"{""Annand, Edward J."",""Bennett, Jane"",""Durrheim, David N."",""Eby, Peggy"",""Eden, John-Sebastian"",""Finlaison, Deborah"",""Hodgson, Evelyn"",""Horsburgh, Bethany A."",""Kerr, James"",""Kirkland, Peter"",""Massey, Peter D."",""Peel, Alison J."",""Taylor, Joanne"",""Thompson, Kirrilly"",""Wood, Kelly""}",10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100423,"{""sentinel disease research"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Classification Of Rare Land Cover Types: Distinguishing Annual And Perennial Crops In An Agricultural Catchment In South Korea,"Many environmental data are inherently imbalanced, with some majority land use and land cover types dominating over rare ones. In cultivated ecosystems minority classes are often the target as they might indicate a beginning land use change. Most standard classifiers perform best on a balanced distribution of classes, and fail to detect minority classes. We used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) with Random Forest to classify land cover classes in a small agricultural catchment in South Korea using MODIS time series. This area faces a major soil erosion problem and policy measures encourage farmers to replace annual by perennial crops to mitigate this issue. Our major goal was therefore to improve the classification performance on annual and perennial crops. We compared four different classification scenarios on original imbalanced and synthetically oversampled balanced data to quantify the effect of SMOTE on classification performance. SMOTE substantially increased the true positive rate of all oversampled minority classes. However, the performance on minor classes remained lower than on the majority class. We attribute this result to a class overlap already present in the original data set that is not resolved by SMOTE. Our results show that resampling algorithms could help to derive more accurate land use and land cover maps from freely available data. These maps can be used to provide information on the distribution of land use classes in heterogeneous agricultural areas and could potentially benefit decision making.",2018,"{""Bogner, Christina"",""Reineking, Bjorn"",""Rohner, Dorian"",""Seo, Bumsuk""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0190476,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Estimation Of Grain Protein Content In Commercial Bread And Durum Wheat Fields Via Traits Inverted By Radiative Transfer Modelling From Sentinel-2 Timeseries,"Wheat (Triticum spp.) is crucial to food security. Grain protein content (GPC) is key to its nutritional and economic value and is controlled by genetic and agronomic factors, soil properties and weather. GPC prediction from remote sensing could reduce nitrogen (N) losses, help management decisions, and improve profit. However, GPC prediction is complex because multiple plant traits influence GPC and their effects change through the growing season. Traits with known physiological links to GPC, which can be retrieved from imaging spectroscopy, include leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll (Ca+b), and stress indicators. Further inspection of these and other traits retrieved from satellite data can advance research relevant to precision agriculture. Sentinel-2 (S2) timeseries (TS) were acquired for 6,355 ha of commercial dryland bread (T. aestivum) and durum (T. durum) wheat fields in south-east Australia through two consecutive years with dissimilar rainfall. Wheat growers provided similar to 92,000 GPC data points from harvester-mounted protein monitors. For each, Ca+b, leaf dry matter, leaf water content (C-w) and LAI were retrieved from the S2 images by radiative transfer model inversion. A gradient boosted machine learning algorithm was applied to analyse these traits' importance to GPC and to predict GPC in 30\% of samples unseen by the algorithm in training. The strongest relationships between predicted and observed GPC (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.56 \%), in a model built from five S2 images across a season, were better than those from single-date hyperspectral (HS). In severe water stress, LAI was the main predictor of GPC early in the season, but this switched to C-w later. Trait importance was more evenly distributed in milder conditions. S2 TS had a clear accuracy advantage over single-date S2 and HS, especially in benign conditions, emphasising the potential of S2 TS for large-scale GPC monitoring.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.10.018,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
The Influence Of Morphological Characteristics Of Green Patch On Its Surrounding Thermal Environment,"In order to explore the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches on its surrounding thermal environment, the remote sensing image data of Taiyuan City was used as the basic data source, and the temperature field under the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches was simulated by CFD technique. The dimensionless parameter of relative temperature change rate was introduced as the index of thermal environment effect. From the existing shape index reflecting the patch characteristics, the indicators of the green patch affecting the surrounding thermal environment were screened out, and the corresponding quantitative relationship between them was established. Based on the statistical analysis of patch shape index and thermal environment effect index, it is pointed out that the deviation degree for equivalent perimeter of patch is positively correlated with the relative change rate of temperature reflecting thermal environment effect. Meanwhile, the smaller area of green space can be used to improve local microclimate. The introduction of CFD technology into the study of urban thermal environment provides a basis for exploring the key parameters to improve the ecological environment benefits of urban green space and determining the shape control index of patch in green space planning and design. On the other hand, the simulation function of CFD technology is used to optimize green space design, which has better significance to guide production practice.",2019,"{""Guo, Jinping"",""Lin, Wenqi"",""Liu, Yanhong"",""Shamseldin, Asaad Y."",""Wei, Qingshun""}",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105594,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Mapping Tropical Forest Biomass With Radar And Spaceborne Lidar In Lopé National Park, Gabon: Overcoming Problems Of High Biomass And Persistent Cloud","Spatially-explicit maps of aboveground biomass are essential for calculating the losses and gains in forest carbon at a regional to national level. The production of such maps across wide areas will become increasingly necessary as international efforts to protect primary forests, such as the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) mechanism, come into effect, alongside their use for management and research more generally. However, mapping biomass over high-biomass tropical forest is challenging as (1) direct regressions with optical and radar data saturate, (2) much of the tropics is persistently cloud-covered, reducing the availability of optical data, (3) many regions include steep topography, making the use of radar data complex, (5) while LiDAR data does not suffer from saturation, expensive aircraft-derived data are necessary for complete coverage. We present a solution to the problems, using a combination of terrain-corrected L-band radar data (ALOS PALSAR), spaceborne LiDAR data (ICESat GLAS) and ground-based data. We map Gabon's Lopé National Park (5000 km2) because it includes a range of vegetation types from savanna to closed-canopy tropical forest, is topographically complex, has no recent contiguous cloud-free high-resolution optical data, and the dense forest is above the saturation point for radar. Our 100 m resolution biomass map is derived from fusing spaceborne LiDAR (7142 ICESat GLAS footprints), 96 ground-based plots (average size 0.8 ha) and an unsupervised classification of terrain-corrected ALOS PALSAR radar data, from which we derive the aboveground biomass stocks of the park to be 78 Tg C (173 Mg C ha-1). This value is consistent with our field data average of 181 Mg C ha-1, from the field plots measured in 2009 covering a total of 78 ha, and which are independent as they were not used for the GLAS-biomass estimation. We estimate an uncertainty of ± 25% on our carbon stock value for the park. This error term includes uncertainties resulting from the use of a generic tropical allometric equation, the use of GLAS data to estimate Lorey's height, and the necessity of separating the landscape into distinct classes. As there is currently no spaceborne LiDAR satellite in operation (GLAS data is available for 2003-2009 only), this methodology is not suitable for change-detection. This research underlines the need for new satellite LiDAR data to provide the potential for biomass-change estimates, although this need will not be met before 2015. © 2012 Author(s).",2012,"{""Abernethy, K.

Lidar-Based Classification Of Sagebrush Community Types,"Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities constitute the largest temperate semidesert in North America and provide important rangelands for livestock and habitat for wildlife. Remote sensing methods might provide an efficient method to monitor sagebrush communities. This study used airborne LiDAR and field data to measure vegetation heights in five different community types at the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, southwestern Idaho: herbaceous-dominated, low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula) -dominated, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp.) -dominated, bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) -dominated, and other vegetation community types. The objectives were 1) to quantify the correlation between field-measured and airborne LiDAR-derived shrub heights, and 2) to determine if airborne LiDAR-derived mean vegetation heights can be used to classify the five community types. The dominant vegetation type and vegetation heights were measured in 3 × 3 m field plots. The LiDAR point cloud data were converted into a raster format to generate a maximum vegetation height map in 3-m raster cells. The regression relationship between field-based and airborne LiDAR-derived shrub heights was significant (R2=0.77; P value <0.001). An analysis of variance test with all pairwise post hoc comparisons indicated that LiDAR-derived vegetation heights were significantly different among all vegetation community types (all P values <0.01), except for herbaceous-dominated communities compared to low sagebrush-dominated communities. Although LiDAR measurements consistently underestimated vegetation heights in all community types, shrub heights at some locations were overestimated due to adjacent taller vegetation. We recommend for future studies a smaller rasterized pixel size that is consistent with the target vegetation canopy diameter. © Society for Range Management.",2011,"{""Bond, P."",""Sankey, T.

Spatial Modeling Of Litter And Soil Carbon Stocks On Forest Land In The Conterminous United States,"Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phenology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 ± 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 ± 2.38 Mg ha −1 , and the soil C stock at 0–20 cm depth was 14.68 ± 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 ± 8.98 Mg ha −1 . This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables. © 2018",2019,"{""Cao, B."",""Domke, G.

Virtual Laser Scanning With Helios++: A Novel Take On Ray Tracing-Based Simulation Of Topographic Full-Waveform 3d Laser Scanning,"Topographic laser scanning is a remote sensing method to create detailed 3D point cloud representations of the Earth's surface. Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are met: (i) models of 3D scene and scanner are available and (ii) modelling of the beam-scene interaction is simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. Such model types include meshes, digital terrain models, point clouds and partially transmissive voxels, which are especially useful in laser scanning simulations of vegetation. In a scene, object models of different types can be combined, so that representations spanning multiple spatial scales in different resolutions and levels of detail are possible. HELIOS++ follows a modular design, where the core components of platform, scene, and scanner can be individually interchanged, and easily configured. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create full-waveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. We show how HELIOS++ positions among other VLS software in terms of input model support and simulation of beam divergence in a literature survey. We also perform a direct comparison of simulations with DART, where we employ a scene from the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI). This example shows that HELIOS++ takes about 10 times longer than DART for parsing and preparing the 3D scene, but performs about 314,000 times faster in the beam simulation, achieving 200,000 rays/s. Comparing HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, revealed reduced runtimes by up to 99%. Virtually scanned point clouds may be used for a broad range of applications as shown in literature. We could identify four main categories of use cases prevailing at present, which benefit from simulated LiDAR point clouds: data acquisition planning, method evaluation, method training and sensing experimentation. We conclude that a general-purpose LiDAR simulator can be employed for many different scientific applications, as long as it is ensured that the simulation adequately represents reality, which is specific to the given research question. © 2021 The Authors",2022,"{""Anders, K."",""Esmorís Pena, A.

Temporal And Spatial Modelling Of Tropical Deforestation: A Survival Analysis Linking Satellite And Household Survey Data,"We estimate a spatially explicit model of the forest clearance process among smallholder farmers in an agricultural frontier of southern Mexico. Our analysis takes as its point of departure a simple utility-maximising model that suggests many possible determinants of deforestation in an economic environment characterised by missing or thin markets. Hypotheses from the model are tested on a data set that combines a time series of satellite imagery with data collected from a survey of farm households whose agricultural plots were geo-referenced using a global positioning system (GPS). We implement a survival analysis to identify the effect of household level explanatory variables on the probability of deforestation. This approach allows us to introduce a measure of the time until clearance as a covariate, thereby affording a control for the effect of potentially important explanatory variables that vary through time but are not directly observable. In addition to identifying several variables relevant for policy analysis, including household demographics, proximity to roads, and government provision of agricultural support, model results suggest that the deforestation process is characterised by non-linear duration dependence, with the probability of forest clearance first decreasing and then increasing with the passage of time.

Estimation Of Crop Water Productivity Using Gis And Remote Sensing Techniques,"The global demand for food is growing with the population and urbanization, which puts pressure on water resources, which need assessing and quantifying water requirements. Adopting efficient irrigation methods to optimize water use is essential in this situation. In this study, crop water productivity (CWP) of major crops in the Rohri canal command area was estimated by the ratio of yield and actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Analyzing the CWP of major crops, water scarcity challenges can be tackled by selecting the most feasible irrigation methods. However, ETa was calculated and aggregated for all four stages of the crop growth period: initial, crop development, flowering stage, and maturity seasons. The crop yield data were obtained from the districts' agricultural statistics. For this purpose, evapotranspiration products of Landsat 5 and 8 were downloaded from Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux). Landsat images were processed in a GIS environment to calculate ETa. The approach suggests developing a CWP database for major crops like wheat, cotton, and rice to improve irrigation water management. The objectives of this study are to estimate and analyze the difference in the CWP and evapotranspiration of major crops for the Rabi and Kharif seasons with high and moderate flows during 1998-2019.

Benefits To World Agriculture Through Remote Sensing,"Remote sensing of agricultural land permits crop classification and mensuration which can lead to improved forecasts of production. This technique is particularly important for nations which do not already have an accurate agricultural reporting system. Better forecasts have important economic effects. International grain traders can make better decisions about when to store, buy and sell. Farmers can make better planting decisions by taking advantage of production estimates for areas out of phase with their own agricultural calendar. World economic benefits will accrue to both buyers and sellers because of increased food supply and price stabilization. This paper reviews the econometric models used to establish this scenario and estimates the dollar value of benefits for world wheat as 200 million dollars annually for the United States and 300-400 million dollars anually for the rest of the world. © 1979.",1979,"{""Buffalano, A.

"A Simple Approach For Monitoring Vegetation Change Using Time Series Remote Sensing Analysis: A Case Study From The Thathe Vondo Area In Limpopo Province, South Africa","This study presents a simple approach of spatiotemporal change detection of vegetation cover based on analysis of time series remotely sensed images. The study was carried out at Thathe Vondo Area, which is characterised by episodic variation of vegetation gain and loss. This variation is attributable to timber and tea plantations and their production cycles, which periodically result in either vegetation gain or loss. The approach presented here was implemented on two ASTER images acquired in 2007 and 2017. It involved the combined use of band combination, unsupervised image classification and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) techniques. True colour composite (TCC) images for 2007 and 2017 were created from combination of bands 1, 2 and 3 in red, blue and green, respectively. The difference image of the TCC images was then generated to show the inconsistencies of vegetation cover between 2007 and 2017. For analytical simplicity and interpretability, the difference image was subjected to ISODATA unsupervised classification, which clustered pixels in the difference image into eight classes. Two ISODATA derived classes were interpreted as vegetation gain and one as vegetation loss. These classes were confimed as regions of vegetation gain and loss by NDVI values of 2007 and 2017. In addition, the polygons of vegetation gain and loss regions were created and superimposed over the TCC images to further demonstrate the spatiotemporal vegetation change in the area. The vegetation change statistics show vegetation gain and loss of 10.62\% and 2.03\%, respectively, implying a vegetation gain of 8.59\% over the selected decade. Significance: Vegetation change detection is essential in environmental monitoring and management of an area. This study presents a simple approach for assessing vegetation change over time. The approach involves change detection through the difference of spectral values of vegetation pixels of time series remotely sensed images.",NA,NA,10.17159/sajs.2021/8226,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
New Approach For Using Remotely Sensed Chlorophyll A To Identify Seabird Hotspots,"Satellite imagery of chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) provides the only holistic perspective of productivity in marine ecosystems worldwide, yet its utility for understanding and predicting the distribution of upper trophic-level predators remains equivocal. We tested the hypothesis that remotely sensed chl a measurements spanning a decade can predict marine bird movements and distributions and provide insight into persistent seabird 'hotspots'. To test this hypothesis, we developed a temporally and spatially explicit chl a variance metric that explained up to twice the variation (90\%) in seabird distributions than mean chl a values in our model system, the California Current. Our chl a variance metric-the frequency of chlorophyll peaks index (FCPI) - quantifies the frequency of chl a anomalies that exceed 1 standard deviation from the mean, relative to a spatial model for the ecosystem. Using the FCPI, we identified locations of high chl a anomaly persistence amidst considerable habitat heterogeneity from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico. Calculating variance and persistence metrics such as FCPI over large temporal scales may be preferable to analyzing mean or median chl a values over shorter time scales if understanding or predicting predator distributions is a goal of the research. As a static habitat layer, we suggest that the FCPI integrates time lags, physical forcings, and food web processes that can thwart attempts to link primary productivity and predator distributions in pelagic ecosystems. Additionally, identifying important ecological areas reflecting persistently elevated productivity and predator abundance is critical to marine spatial management and conservation.",2012,"{""Santora, Jarrod A."",""Suryan, Robert M."",""Sydeman, William J.""}",10.3354/meps09597,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Soil Moisture Monitoring By Downscaling Of Remote Sensing Products Using Lst/Vi Space Derived From Modis Products,"Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of the obtained results with the ground stations data, the LPRM and the ESA-CCI downscaled images had the best statistical indices values accordingly in 2010 and 2014 that confirm the promising application of remote sensing soil moisture data (rLPRM (2010) = 0.92, MAELPRM (2010) = 4.14\%, RMSELPRM (2010) = 6.39\% and rESA-CC I(2014) = 0.7, MAEESA-CCI (2014)=2.23\%, RMSEESA-CCI (2014)=2.59\%).",NA,NA,10.2166/ws.2023.002,{validation},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Local Drivers Of Anthropogenic Climate Change: Quantifying The Impact Through A Remote Sensing Approach In Brisbane,"Urban expansions to adjoining greenfield sites, particularly in metropolitan regions, have become a global occurrence. Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured. The study utilizes a remote sensing approach to investigate the impacts of a period of over 30 years (1989-2019) in Brisbane, Australia and its adjoining local government areas. The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs12142270,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Spatiotemporal Weighted For Improving The Satellite-Based High-Resolution Ground Pm2.5 Estimation Using The Light Gradient Boosting Machine,"Surface fine particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) negatively impacts human health and the economy. However, due to data and model limitations, obtaining high-quality, high-spatial-resolution surface PM2.5 concentration data is a challenging task, and it is difficult to accurately assess the temporal and spatial changes in PM2.5 levels at a small regional scale. Here, we combined multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol products, ERA5 reanalysis data, etc., to construct an STW-LightGBM model that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution and estimate the PM2.5 concentration of China's surface at 1 km resolution from 2015 to 2020. Our model performed well, and the fitting accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validation between years was 0.877-0.917. The fitting accuracy of the model was >0.85 at different time scales (month, season, and year). The average slope of the regression prediction was 0.9 annually. The results showed that PM2.5 pollution improved from 2015 to 2020. The average PM2.5 concentration decreased by 4.55 mu g/m(3), and the maximum decrease reached 90.51 mu g/m(3). The areas with high PM2.5 concentrations were predominantly in the North China Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Xinjiang in the west, and the levels in areas with elevated PM2.5 levels were consistent across most study years. The standard deviation ellipse for PM2.5 in China showed a 'northeast-southwest' spatial distribution. From an interannual perspective, the average values of the four seasonal stations in the country showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2020, with the most obvious decline in winter, from 70.67 mu g/m(3) in 2015 to 46.75 mu g/m(3) in 2020.

"The Sentinel-3 Olci Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (Otci): Algorithm Improvements, Spatiotemporal Consistency And Continuity With The Meris Archive","The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on-board Sentinel-3 (2016-present) was designed with similar mechanical and optical characteristics to the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) (2002-2012) to ensure continuity with a number of land and marine biophysical products. The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R-2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R-2>0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD similar to 0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs12162652,{validation},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Distribution Of Volatile Organic Compounds Over Indian Subcontinent During Winter: Wrf-Chem Simulation Versus Observations,"We investigate the distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)over Indian subcontinent during a winter month of January 2011 combining the regional model WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry)with ground- and space-based observations and chemical reanalysis. WRF-Chem simulated VOCs are found to be comparable with ground-based observations over contrasting environments of the Indian subcontinent. WRF-Chem results reveal the elevated levels of VOCs (e. g. propane)over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (16 ppbv), followed by the Northeast region (9.1 ppbv)in comparison with other parts of the Indian subcontinent (1.3–8.2 ppbv). Higher relative abundances of propane (27–31%)and ethane (13–17%)are simulated across the Indian subcontinent. WRF-Chem simulated formaldehyde and glyoxal show the western coast, Eastern India and the Indo-Gangetic Plain as the regional hotspots, in a qualitative agreement with the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate)reanalysis and satellite-based observations. Lower values of RGF (ratio of glyoxal to formaldehyde <0.04)suggest dominant influences of the anthropogenic emissions on the distribution of VOCs over Indian subcontinent, except the northeastern region where higher RGF (∼0.06)indicates the role of biogenic emissions, in addition to anthropogenic emissions. Analysis of HCHO/NO2 ratio shows a NOx-limited ozone production over India, with a NOx-to-VOC transition regime over central India and IGP.

Analysis Of Extreme Rainfall And Natural Disasters Events Using Satellite Precipitation Products In Different Regions Of Brazil,"The number of natural disasters triggered by extreme events is increasing worldwide and significantly impacts modern society. Extreme rainfall is one of the most important factors contributing to these events. A better understanding of the physical process that causes extreme rainfall can allow rapid responses from decision-makers to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the local population. Satellite monitoring is widely used for this purpose and is essential for regions where terrestrial observations are limited or non-existent. The primary purpose of this study is to describe the performance of satellite products for extreme rainfall events that caused natural disasters in various climate regimes in Brazil and discuss the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) to these events. We defined regions based on the climatological rainfall distribution. Cases with rain values above the 99th percentile during 2012-2016 were considered statistically extreme. Our analysis is based on three datasets, with precipitation from (i) rain gauge stations, (ii) different satellite-based estimates, and (iii) mesoscale convective tracking data. The methodology was based on identifying extreme rainfall events, analyzing the performance of satellite precipitation estimates and, finally, quantifying the influence of convective systems on extreme rain. Although all regions of Brazil may be affected by natural disasters caused by extreme rains, the results suggest that the impacts caused in each region are different in magnitude. Convective systems explained over 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in Brazil's south and about 60\% to 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in the Northeast. In general, satellite products have identified rain events; however, in the southern region of Brazil, products have tended to overestimate rainfall, while other regions have tended to underestimate extreme rain values. The methods used in satellite precipitation estimation products have limitations to accurately identifying specific extreme rain events.",NA,NA,10.3390/atmos13101680,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Air Pollution Mortality Benefits Of Sustained Covid-19 Mobility Restrictions In Australian Cities,"Objectives: Emissions from road traffic, power generation and industry were substantially reduced during pandemic lockdown periods globally. Thus, we analysed reductions in traffic-related air pollution in Australian capital cities during March-April 2020 and then modelled the mortality benefits that could be realised if similar reductions were sustained by structural policy interventions.Study design: Satellite, air pollution monitor and land use observations were used to estimate ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in all Australian capital cities during: (a) a typical year with no prolonged air pollution events; (b) a hypothetical sustained reduction in NO2 equivalent to the COVID-19 lockdowns.Methods: We use the WHO recommended NO2 exposure-response coefficient for mortality (1.023, 95 \% CI: 1.008-1.037, per 10 mg/m3 annual average) to assess gains in life expectancy and population-wide years of life from reduced exposure to traffic-related air pollution.Results: We attribute 1.1 \% of deaths to anthropogenic NO2 exposures in Australian cities, corresponding to a total of 13,340 years of life lost annually. Although COVID-19-related reductions in NO2 varied widely between Australian cities during April 2020, equivalent and sustained reductions in NO2 emissions could reduce NO2-attributable deaths by 27 \%, resulting in 3348 years of life gained annually.Conclusions: COVID-19 mobility restrictions reduced NO2 emissions and population-wide exposures in Australian cities. When sustained to the same extent by policy interventions that reduce fossil fuel consumption by favouring the uptake of electric vehicles, active travel and public transport, the health, mortality and economic benefits will be measurable in Australian cities.(c) 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health.

The Utility Of Random Forests For Wildfire Severity Mapping,"Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95\%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74\%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6\%-21\%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55\%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rse.2018.07.005,"{""values algorithm""}",excluded,"{""Valued data is not ESI""}"
Improving Spatial Resolution Of Grace-Derived Water Storage Changes Based On Geographically Weighted Regression Downscaled Model,"Obtaining high-resolution products that can accurately estimate the spatiotemporal changes in regional water resources is essential for the rational utilization of water resources. The temporal gravity field model derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite can effectively monitor the regional terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes. Nevertheless, the main of GRACE products is their coarse spatial resolution, which limits their applicability to small-scale regions. Herein, we propose a geographically weighted regression downscaled model (GWRDM) to improve the spatial resolution of TWS from 0.5 degrees to 0.1 degrees and validate it against the downscaled results provided by the spatial global regression downscaled model (SGRDM) and temporal grid regression downscaled model (TGRDM). The results show that the downscaled products based on GWRDM outperform those based on SGRDM and TGRDM. The GWRDM not only effectively improves the spatial resolution of GRACE products but also maintains the intensity of the original signal. Similarly, the GWRDM is further used to downscale groundwater storage (GWS) and validated against the in situ observations. The downscaled GWS based on GWRDM agrees well with in situ observations. On the monthly scale, the average correlation coefficient (CC) for both is 0.53 and above 0.70 for some in situ observations. On the annual scale, 81.25\% and 37.50\% of the in situ observations have CC values larger than 0.60 and 0.90, respectively, which further verifies the reliability of GWRDM. Consequently, the GWRDM provides a practical algorithm for obtaining high-resolution water storage estimates, which is expected to provide a reference for small-scale regional water resources management.",NA,NA,10.1109/jstars.2023.3272916,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Integrated Concepts In Water Reuse: Managing Global Water Needs,"Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater, and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation, recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies. The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous. Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water, co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including: the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel applications; the need for public education and increased public acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians. Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception, understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate disposal), increase in the use of '' alternative sources '', environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation and reuse projects.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.desal.2005.04.068,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"
Potential Ecosystem Service Values Of Mangrove Forests In Southeastern China Using High-Resolution Satellite Data,"Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US\$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US\$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US\$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23\% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US\$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78\% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33\% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US\$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US\$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecss.2018.05.023,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Network Analysis Of Sea Turtle Movements And Connectivity: A Tool For Conservation Prioritization,"Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of animal movements is a critical element in conserving long-lived, highly mobile marine species. Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts. Location Global. Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections. Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links. Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.",NA,NA,10.1111/ddi.13485,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"
Sand Dams For Sustainable Water Management: Challenges And Future Opportunities,"Sand dams are impermeable water harvesting structures built to collect and store water within the volume of sediments transported by ephemeral rivers. The artificial sandy aquifer created by the sand damreduces evaporation losses relative to surface water storage in traditional dams. Recent years have seen a renaissance of studies on sand dams as an effective water scarcity adaptation strategy for drylands. However, many aspects of their functioning and effectiveness are still unclear. Literature reviews have pointed to a range of research gaps that need further scientific attention, such as river corridors and network dynamics, watershed-scale impacts, and interaction with social dynamics. However, the scattered and partially incomplete information across the different reviews would benefit froman integrated framework for directing future research efforts. This paper is a collaborative effort of different research groups active on sand dams and stems from the need to channel future research efforts on this topic in a thorough and coherent way. We synthesize the pivotal research gaps of a) unclear definition of ""functioning"" sand dams, b) lack of methodologies for watershed-scale analysis, c) neglect of social aspects in sand dam research, and d) underreported impacts of sand dams. We then propose framing future research to better target the synthesized gaps, including using the socialecological systems framework to better capture the interconnected social and biophysical research gaps on sand dams, fully utilizing the potential of remote sensing in large-scale studies and collecting sand dam cases across the world to create an extensive database to advance evidence-based research on sand dams.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156126,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Anthropic Effects On The Geomorphology And Morphodynamics Of The Coastal Zone Of La Paz Lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico","The aridity and geographic isolation of the region currently occupied by the State of Baja California Sur have determined its status as a sparsely populated region for most of its history, which has allowed the ecosystems therein to remain pristine or little impacted.

This trend became evident in La Paz city since the 1990s (population as of 1995: 158,800; as of 2015: 253,021 inhabitants), caused by a tourism-driven economy that has led to accelerated, unplanned urban sprawling (urban area as of 1995: 44.7 km2; as of 2017: 85.7 km2). The objective of this study was to identify and analyze anthropic effects on the geomorphology and morphodynamics of the coastal zone, starting with the geomorphological reconstruction of the likely original conditions, followed by an analysis of the population growth and economic activities leading to urban expansion, to finally elucidating their effects on and the evolutionary response of the coastal zone. We used linear regression methods for analyzing geomorphological and morphodynamic changes from historical documents, particularly those that are, or can be, georeferenced such as maps, aerial photographs, and satellite images. This allows utilizing both methods over long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales. Linear regression methods used all the shoreline location data points available to identify changes over time and estimate evolutionary rates. One distinctive advantage of linear regressions is the possibility of using coastlines as delineated from aerial photographs or historical maps, since beach profiles encompassing long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales are usually not available. The study area comprises two distinct geomorphological units - the alluvial plain and the coastal zone - subject to increasing anthropic activity as evidenced by urban expansion over time. This affects the geomorphological environment, causing major changes in the physical environment, such as fragmentation in parcels and streets, deforestation, and land leveling, as well as the diversion and filling of streambeds. The direct effects of anthropogenic activities on the coastal zone lead to the alteration and partial or total loss of coastal ecosystems such as coastal plains, marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, caused by the construction of tourism infrastructure including hotels, marinas, docks, golf courses, and buildings ranging from residential areas to car junkyards. At the same time, the effects of human activities on the alluvial plain indirectly impact the coastal zone through the reduction of the effective runoff area caused by unabated urban expansion. This, in turn, impairs the sedimentary balance that gave rise to alluvial coastal environments, in which the intensity of the dynamic agents (such as wind, tides, and waves) acting on the coastal zone remained constant. These agents have been acting with the same intensity but, in the absence of sedimentary material, conditions have changed sufficiently to affect the morphodynamics of the coastal fringe of the La Paz lagoon. The evolutionary trend of the La Paz lagoon shows that it has experienced an erosive process at a rate of 0.00227 km2 over 44 years (from 1973 to 2017, or 0.3 m/ year). Paradoxically, the poor or nil urban growth planning is not only causing the loss of the resources that support tourism activities, but is also exacerbating the vulnerability to flooding events in La Paz city and surrounding suburbs. Therefore, it is crucial to properly weigh the benefits of continuing building hotels, marinas, golf courses, residential areas, and other types of infrastructure, versus those of conserving marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, whose proper use and management would contribute to the sustainable economic and environmental development of the region. © 2020 Instituto de Geografia.

Limited Reciprocal Surrogacy Of Bird And Habitat Diversity And Inconsistencies In Their Representation In Romanian Protected Areas,"Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found a limited reciprocal surrogacy performance, with bird species performing slightly better as a conservation surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. We could also show that areas with a high conservation value based on habitat diversity were represented better in already existing protected areas than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.",NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0251950,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Federated Space Systems' Trade-Space Exploration For Strategic Robustness,"Motivated by the growth of the commercial space economy and renewed focus on the disaggregation of military space systems, this work develops a method for conceptual design of federated satellite systems as a collaborative system of systems (SOS). Objectives seek to improve the likelihood of successful SOS formation and pursue constituent system utility robustness. The proposed metaheuristic optimization trade-space exploration method accounts for technical and economic design variables and multi-decision-maker strategy dynamics. Constituent system designs are ranked on their simulated net present value. A game-theoretic measure of risk dominance is used in concert with the net present value to assess the robustness and utility of candidate SOS designs. The method is validated with a notional application case that assesses potential collaboration between Earth-observing and telecommunications systems. The proposed methodology reduces the threshold probability of partner collaboration for which SOS participation is economically rational by up to 18\% for the most efficient designs as compared to a typical conceptual design method, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful SOS formation. The results highlight the importance of accounting for strategy dynamics when designing systems for collaboration.",NA,NA,10.2514/1.a35103,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
"Analysis Of Epidemic Characteristics And Related Factors Of Norovirus In Diarrhea Patients In Guangxi, 2015-2020","Objective To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and related factors of norovirus in Guangxi from 2015 to 2020, and to provide scientific recommendations for norovirus prevention and control. Methods The foodborne diseases surveillance data were collected from 11 sentinel hospitals through the National Foodborne Disease Monitoring and Reporting System from 2015 to 2020. R software with version 4.0.3 was used for descriptive and statistical analysis, including epidemic curve, chi-square test, and trend chi-square and so on. Logistic regression was used to analyze norovirus-related factors, OR values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated respectively with the statistical test level of P<0.05. Results There were 1 008 norovirus cases detected, with a detection rate of 12.75% (1 008/7 903). Children with age less than 5 years (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.13-1.82) and patients at age 20-45 (OR=1.45, 95%CI: 1.13-1.87) were high risk population. The detection rate was higher in autumn (OR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.08-1.53) but lower in summer (OR=0.67, 95%CI: 0.55-0.80). In addition, the tourist area (Guilin City) presented a higher detection rate than other areas (OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.80). Aquatic products (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.03-1.91), meat and dairy products (OR=1.31, 95%CI: 1.06-1.61) were high-risk foods for norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can reduce the possibility of norovirus by 61% (OR= 0.39, 95%CI: 0.31-0.49) showed a declining trend (Trend χ2=85.33, P<0.001). In addition, prolonged visit time can lead to 19%-23% decrease in the detection rate of norovirus (OR24-48 hours=0.81, 95%CI: 0.70-0.95; OR>48 hours=0.77, 95%CI: 0.63-0.93). Conclusions The epidemic of norovirus presented seasonal and regional distribution in Guangxi with a declining detection rate trend in diarrhea patients during recent 6 years. Young children were high-risk population in infection norovirus. The intake of seafood can increase the risk of norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can sharply decrease the possibility of infection norovirus. The monitoring of key foods such as seafood should be strengthened, and the early screening of suspected cases should be taken. The norovirus monitoring should be improved to ensure the health of the population. © 2023 The authors.",NA,NA,10.13604/j.cnki.46-1064/r.2023.02.08,"{""sentinel hospitals"",spurious}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Assessment Of Landcover Impacts On The Groundwater Quality Using Hydrogeochemical And Geospatial Techniques,"Groundwater quality is influenced by urbanization and land use land cover (LULC) changes. This study investigated their impact on groundwater quality in Quetta City, Pakistan, from 2015 to 2021. About 58 groundwater samples from monitoring wells were analyzed using hydrogeochemical and statistical methods. The water quality index (WQI), Wilcox, USSL, and various agricultural indices were employed to assess water quality trends. LULC analysis and NDVI using Sentinel-2 imagery revealed increased urban and agricultural areas and decreased barren land. Rapid urbanization was evident, with the buildup class expanding by 7.50\% during this period. NDVI findings emphasized monitoring vegetation health and water quality for environmental assessments. The groundwater in Quetta was primarily classified as Cl-Ca center dot Mg, Cl-Ca, and Cl-Na according to the Piper diagram, with water-rock interactions and rock weathering evident. Most groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation according to the Wilcox and USSL diagrams. The WQI demonstrated overall safety for human consumption, but declining WQI values in northern parts due to urbanization are concerning. The results also revealed a moderate positive relationship between landcover classes and WQI values. It can be concluded that urbanization and excessive use of pesticides contributed to declining agricultural land quality. The spatial overlay of agricultural indices with landcover class suggested that barren land was most suitable, followed by build-up and agriculture were suitable for drinking and agriculture purposes. Moreover, agricultural indices moderately declined due to excessive fertilizers and pesticides in the agriculture landcover class. Thus, effective water resource management is crucial to address challenges. This comprehensive study serves as a baseline for future research and recommends larger-scale studies to implement efficient management strategies, urbanization planning, and safe irrigation and drinking water practices to prevent groundwater pollution.",2023,"{""Amin, Gomal"",""Baloch, Muhammad Yousuf Jat"",""Haroon, Ehsan"",""Iqbal, Javed"",""Su, Chunli""}",10.1007/s11356-023-29628-w,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Within-Field Nitrogen Response In Corn Related To Aerial Photograph Color,"Precise management of nitrogen (N) using canopy color in aerial imagery of corn (Zea mays L.) has been proposed as a strategy on which to base the rate of N fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between canopy color and yield response to N at the field scale. Six N response trials were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in fields with alluvial, claypan and deep loess soil types. Aerial images were taken with a 35-mm slide film from a parts per thousand yen1100 m at the mid- and late-vegetative corn growth stages and processed to extract green and red digital values. Color values of the control N (0 kg N ha(-1)) and sufficient N (280 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting) treatments were used to calculate the relative ratio of unfertilized to fertilized and relative difference color values. Other N fertilizer treatments included side-dressed applications in increments of 56 kg N ha(-1). The economic optimal N rate was weakly related (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.34) or not related to the color indices at both growth stages. For many sites, delta yield (the increase in yield between control N and sufficient N treatments) was related to the color indices (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.67) at the late vegetative growth stage; the best relationship was with green relative difference. The results indicate the potential for color indices from aerial photographs to be used for predicting delta yield from which a site-specific N rate could be determined.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11119-009-9137-x,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Optimal Design Of Lightweight Off-Axis Mirror And Flexible Support,"This study proposes a design method combining variable density topology optimization and multi-objective integration optimization with minimum size constraints for the overall design of multispectral cameras, adhering to the design concept of integration, miniaturization, and ultra-lightweight. This approach is used for spatial separation, and the optimized design of an axis microcrystalline mirror and a back support structure (heat dissipation mandrel, flexible joint, and backplate). The mirror has an aperture of 218 mm x 166 mm, mass of 0.917 kg, and weight reduction rate of 71.3\%. In addition, the processed and assembled reflector components arc subjected to engineering environmental tests and surface interference detection. Test results show that the root mean square value of the mirror surface before and after the environmental test is greater than 1/50 lambda, detection wavelength lambda=632.8 nm, and fundamental frequency is 397.8 Hz, meeting the design requirements of an optical system and optical satellite platform.

"Physical Flood Vulnerability Mapping Applying Geospatial Techniques In Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan","Flooding has been increasing since 2004 in Japan due to localized heavy rainfall and geographical conditions. Determining areas vulnerable to flooding as one element of flood hazard maps related to disaster management for urban development is necessary. This research integrated Remote Sensing data, the Geography Information System (GIS) method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculation to determine the physical flood-vulnerable area in Okazaki City. We developed this research by applying data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) to generate the slope map and drainage density; AMEDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System) from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to generate the rainfall data; Soil map from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) data; and Sentinel-2 imagery to generate the land cover map. We applied the AHP calculation for weighting pairwise the parameters by comparing five iterations of the normalized matrix. We utilized the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS to run the pairwise comparison to adjudicate the distribution of flooding according to the AHP procedure. The percentage of relative weight was slope (43\%), drainage density (20\%), rainfall intensity (17\%), then both infiltration rate and land cover (10\%). The consistency value was reasonable: consistency index (CI-0.007) and consistency ratio (CR-0.6\%). We generated high accuracy for flood vulnerability prediction; 0.88 for Probability of Detection (POD), 0.28 for Probability of False Detection (POFD), 0.44 for Critical Success Index (CSI), 1.9 for Bias, and 95 of Area under Curve (AUC). The flood vulnerability was matched to the flood inundation survey of Okazaki City in August 2008 and indicated an excellent Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC).",NA,NA,10.3390/urbansci1010007,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Predicting Treatment Effects In Unipolar Depression: A Meta-Review,"There is increasing interest in clinical prediction models in psychiatry, which focus on developing multivariate algorithms to guide personalized diagnostic or management decisions. The main target of these models is the prediction of treatment response to different antidepressant therapies. This is because the ability to predict response based on patients' personal data may allow clinicians to make improved treatment decisions, and to provide more efficacious or more tolerable medications to the right patient. We searched the literature for systematic reviews about treatment prediction in the context of existing treatment modalities for adult unipolar depression, until July 2019. Treatment effect is defined broadly to include efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability outcomes. We first focused on the identification of individual predictor variables that might predict treatment response, and second, we considered multivariate clinical prediction models. Our meta-review included a total of 10 systematic reviews; seven (from 2014 to 2018) focusing on individual predictor variables and three focusing on clinical prediction models. These identified a number of sociodemographic, phenomenological, clinical, neuroimaging, remote monitoring, genetic and serum marker variables as possible predictor variables for treatment response, alongside statistical and machine-learning approaches to clinical prediction model development. Effect sizes for individual predictor variables were generally small and clinical prediction models had generally not been validated in external populations. There is a need for rigorous model validation in large external data-sets to prove the clinical utility of models. We also discuss potential future avenues in the field of personalized psychiatry, particularly the combination of multiple sources of data and the emerging field of artificial intelligence and digital mental health to identify new individual predictor variables. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,"{""Cipriani, A."",""Efthimiou, O."",""Gillett, G."",""Tomlinson, A.""}",10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107557,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Review or opinion""}"
Antithrombotic Therapy For Long-Term Secondary Prevention Of Acute Coronary Syndrome In High-Risk Patients,"Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represent a major clinical burden, because they tend to experience recurrent ischemic events. Acute management of patients with ACS includes combination antithrombotic therapy composed of a parenteral anticoagulant and dual-antiplatelet therapy. Dual-antiplatelet therapy is also recommended for long-term secondary prevention of ACS. Despite advances in the antithrombotic therapies available, clinical trials suggest that patients with ACS still face a similar to 10\% risk of another event within 12-15 months of the index event. Certain patient populations, such as elderly patients and those with renal impairment or heart failure, are at higher risk of recurrent ACS events, because these patients have more vascular ischemic and bleeding risk factors than most other patients. Evidence from the GRACE and CRUSADE registries suggests underuse of the guideline-recommended evidencebased therapies for the management of ACS in such patients. This review summarizes the current standard of care for patients with ACS, focusing on long-term secondary antithrombotic strategies. Registry data are used to identify high-risk patient populations; the recent antiplatelet and anticoagulant Phase III trial data are summarized to highlight any patient populations who receive greater or lesser benefit from specific long-term antithrombotic strategies.

Monitoring Canada's Forests. Part 2: National Forest Fragmentation And Pattern,"Canada is one of the world's largest nations, with a land area of nearly one billion hectares. This vast area is home to a number of unique ecosystems, comprised of different climate, land cover, topography, and disturbance characteristics. Depiction of forest composition, based on satellite-derived land cover, is a common means to characterize and identify trends in forest conditions and land use. Forest pattern analyses that consider the size, distribution, and connectivity of forest patches can provide insights to land use, habitat, and biodiversity. In this communication, we present the pattern characteristics of Canada's forests as determined by the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) product, a new land cover classification of the forested area of Canada. The EOSD product (EOSD LC 2000) represents conditions circa the year 2000, mapping each 25 m x 25 m pixel into one of 23 categories. We used the EOSD data to assess forest patterns nationally at four spatial extents: level 1, 13 000 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 250 000 scale National Topographic System (NTS) map sheet); level 2, 800 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 50 000 scale NTS map sheet); level 3, 1 km(2); and level 4, 1 ha. For levels 1-3, a total of 95 landscape pattern metrics were calculated; for the 1 ha units, a subset of eight metrics were calculated. The results of this analysis indicate that Canada's forest pattern varies by ecozone, with some ecozones characterized by large areas of contiguous forest (i.e., Boreal Shield, Atlantic Maritime, and Montane Cordillera), while other ecozones have less forest and are characterized by large numbers of small forest patches, reflecting the complex mosaic of land cover types present (Taiga Shield, Taiga Cordillera). Trends for the subset of metrics used to characterize national conditions are relatively consistent across levels 1-3. Level 4 metrics, where the analysis extent is 1 ha, are well-suited to regional or local analyses. As the first regional assessments of the patterns contained in the EOSD LC 2000, these measures of Canada's forest landscape patterns add value to the national land cover baseline.",2008,"{""Cardille, Jeffrey A."",""Coops, Nicholas C."",""Grills, Danny"",""Han, Tian"",""Holland, Tara"",""White, Joanne C."",""Wulder, Michael A.""}",10.5589/m08-081,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A Dilemma Between Flood And Drought Management: Case Study Of The Upper Chao Phraya Flood-Prone Area In Thailand,"Floods are the greatest natural disaster in Thailand, but they are an important part of recharging the water volume for groundwater resources. This paper focused on evaluating and discussing the relationship between flood magnitudes and flood management impacting groundwater storage in the Upper Chao Phraya River basin in Thailand, where the intensive rice production of the region is located. Based on satellite image data, there were annual flood inundations varying from 1950 to 10,470 km(2) over the period 2005-2019. The evaluation shows those flooding events yielded floodwater recharge of approximately 0.5-5.9 km(3). To lessen the flood damage, floodways with 2000 m(3) s(-1) of drainage capacity are proposed by the government. This measure aims to accelerate flood surplus out to the gulf of Thailand and to confine the flooding areas to a maximum value of 4650 km(2). A reduction of approximately 3.4 km(3) of groundwater storage is estimated if the floodways are implemented. Staple crops in the dry season, especially rice fields outside an irrigation project (rainfed area), cope with water stress. To sustain basin water demand in the dry season, approximately 1820 km(2) should be allowed for an area flooded for a month where 0.9 km(3) of water volume is harvested annually. Although flood control is important, potential impact on the reduction of groundwater recharge needs to be carefully considered. Therefore, a flood control policy shows the balance of available basin water occasionally supplied by the groundwater while rice water demand is being proposed.",2022,"{""Ekkawatpanit, Chaiwat"",""Lee, Kwan Tun"",""Pratoomchai, Weerayuth"",""Yoobanpot, Naphol""}",10.3390/w14244056,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Remote Sensing Based Binary Classification Of Maize. Dealing With Residual Autocorrelation In Sparse Sample Situations,"In order to discuss potential sustainability issues of expanding silage maize cultivation in Rhineland-Palatinate, spatially explicit monitoring is necessary. Publicly available statistical records are often not a sufficient basis for extensive research, especially on soil health, where risk factors like erosion and compaction depend on variables that are specific to every site, and hard to generalize for larger administrative aggregates. The focus of this study is to apply established classification algorithms to estimate maize abundance for each independent pixel, while at the same time accounting for their spatial relationship. Therefore, two ways to incorporate spatial autocorrelation of neighboring pixels are combined with three different classification models. The performance of each of these modeling approaches is analyzed and discussed. Finally, one prediction approach is applied to the imagery, and the overall predicted acreage is compared to publicly available data. We were able to show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and Random Forests (RF) were able to distinguish maize pixels reliably, with kappa values well above 0.9 in most cases. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) performed substantially worse. Furthermore, Regression Kriging (RK) as an approach to integrate spatial autocorrelation into the prediction model is not suitable in use cases with millions of sparsely clustered training pixels. Gaussian Blur is able to improve predictions slightly in these cases, but it is possible that this is only because it smoothes out impurities of the reference data. The overall prediction with RF classification combined with Gaussian Blur performed well, with out of bag error rates of 0.5% in 2009 and 1.3% in 2016. Despite the low error rates, there is a discrepancy between the predicted acreage and the official records, which is 20% in 2009 and 27% in 2016. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,"{""Emmerling, C."",""Gilcher, M."",""Ruf, T."",""Udelhoven, T.""}",10.3390/rs11182172,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A Sensor Web Architecture For Integrating Smart Oceanographic Sensors Into The Semantic Sensor Web,"Effective ocean and coastal data management are needed to manage marine ecosystem health. Past ocean and coastal data management systems were often very specific to a particular application and region, but this focused approach often lacks real-time data and sharing/interoperating capability. The challenge for the ocean observing community is to devise standards and practices that enable integration of data from sensors across devices, manufacturers, users, and domains to enable new types of application and services that facilitate much more comprehensive understanding and analyses of marine ecosystem. A given kind of sensor may be deployed on various platforms such as floats, gliders or moorings, and thus must be integrated with different operation. and data management systems. Simplifying the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems would benefit system operators and is important for the broader application of diverse sensors. This paper describes a geospatial ""sensor web"" architecture developed by the ""NeXOS"" project for ocean and coastal data management, based on the concepts of spatial data infrastructure and the Sensor Web Enablement framework of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This approach reduces the effort to propagate data front deployed sensors to users.

A Partition Modeling For Anthropogenic Heat Flux Mapping In China,"Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities has a major impact on urban and regional climate. Accurately estimating anthropogenic heat is of great significance for studies on urban thermal environment and climate change. In this study, a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation scheme was constructed based on socio-economic data, energy-consumption data, and multi-source remote sensing data using a partition modeling method, which takes into account the regional characteristics of AH emission caused by the differences in regional development levels. The refined AHF mapping in China was realized with a high resolution of 500 m. The results show that the spatial distribution of AHF has obvious regional characteristics in China. Compared with the AHF in provinces, the AHF in Shanghai is the highest which reaches 12.56W·m-2, followed by Tianjin, Beijing, and Jiangsu. The AHF values are 5.92 W·m-2, 3.35 W·m-2, and 3.10 W·m-2, respectively. As can be seen from the mapping results of refined AHF, the high-value AHF aggregation areas are mainly distributed in north China, east China, and south China. The high-value AHF in urban areas is concentrated in 50-200 W·m-2, and maximum AHF in Shenzhen urban center reaches 267 W·m-2. Further, compared with other high resolution AHF products, it can be found that the AHF results in this study have higher spatial heterogeneity, which can better characterize the emission characteristics of AHF in the region. The spatial pattern of the AHF estimation results correspond to the distribution of building density, population, and industry zone. The high-value AHF areas are mainly distributed in airports, railway stations, industry areas, and commercial centers. It can thus be seen that the AHF estimation models constructed by the partition modeling method can well realize the estimation of large-scale AHF and the results can effectively express the detailed spatial distribution of AHF in local areas. These results can provide technical ideas and data support for studies on surface energy balance and urban climate change. © 2019 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11091132,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Barrier-Based Longitudinal Connectivity Index For Managing Urban Rivers,"A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel. © 2018 by the authors.",NA,NA,10.3390/w10111701,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Spatiotemporal Impact Of Urbanization On Urban Heat Island And Urban Thermal Field Variance Index Of Tianjin City, China","The rapid infrastructure development in densely populated areas has had several negative impacts. Increases in urbanization have led to increased LST, and urban ecological systems have been negatively affected. Urban heat islands (UHIs) can be mitigated by understanding how current and future LST phenomena are linked to changes in landscape composition and land use cover (LUC). This study investigated the multi-scale spatial analysis of LUC and LST in Tianjin using remote sensing and GIS data. We used Landsat data from 2005 to 2020 to examine the effects of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration. According to the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), the city's ecological evaluation was carried out. Results show that changes in LUC and other anthropogenic activities affect the spatial distribution of LST. For the study years (2004-2009), the estimated mean LST in Tianjin was 25.32 degrees C, 26.73 degrees C, 27.62 degrees C, and 27.93 degrees C. Between LST and urban areas with other infrastructures, and NDBI, significant positive correlation values were found about 0.53, 0.48, and 0.76 (p < 0.05), respectively. Temperatures would almost certainly increase by 3.87 degrees C to 7.26 degrees C as a result of decreased plant cover and increased settlements. These findings strongly imply a correlation between LST and the vegetation index. Between 2005 and 2020, the anticipated increase in LST of 3.39 degrees C is expected to harm urban environmental health.

Taking the Lingbei rare earth mining area as an example, combined with remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time sequence analysis method, we used HJ-1B CCD (charge-coupled device), Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing data during 1990-2016, and analyzed land distribution and rare earth mining area damage and recovery process. In order to reduce the NDVI error caused by the sensor itself, NDVI conversion equation of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8 data was constructed by using the regression analysis method, NDVI image of HJ-1B CCD was transformed into the NDVI image corresponding to the years of Landsat 5/8 (the analog image) by using conversion equation, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the simulated image and the real Landsat 5/8 NDVI image was calculated and the accuracy of the transformation equation was verified. The results showed that the R2 values of NDVI equations from HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5, HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 8 data were 0.9319 and 0.9552, both more than 0.9, indicating that there is obvious linear positive correlation between the NDVI of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8. The RMSE values of NDVI imaging between simulation images and real Landsat 5, and simulation images and real Landsat 8 were 0.0293 and 0.040, which were less than 0.05, showing that the obtained conversion equation has high accuracy and can eliminate the influence of different data sources on the NDVI. Combining NDVI threshold of mining and non-mining, and threshold of non-rare earth mining interference and rare earth mining interference, Lingbei rare earth mining area had annual rare earth mining activity from 1990 to 2016, rare earth mining area of which was smaller in 1990, 1991,1995 and 2000, mining area was more than 1 km2 in 2001-2006, and the mining area reached 2.546 1 km2 in 2006; after 2006, to maintain the rare earth mining scale at the lower level, the country began to implement control of rare earth mining, and the spatial distribution of rare earth mining was more dispersed, which not only caused difficulties in supervision and waste of resources, but also increased governance difficulties to a certain extent. Testing the extraction accuracy of land destruction and restoration type, extraction accuracy of various types was found above 85%, most of which reached more than 90%, satisfying the requirement of accuracy. Analysis of land destruction and restoration type showed that the area that was not disturbed was 97.082 1 km2, accounting for 45.41% of the total mining area; anthropogenic disturbance area was 116.709 3 km2, accounting for 54.59% of the total mining area; the area affected by deforestation disturbance was the largest, which was 86.534 1 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration was 3 years; the arable land that was not abandoned occupied 5.404 5 km2; cultivated land abandoned for many years and that for returning to forest occupied 9.390 6 km2; orchard development area was 3.148 2 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration for 7 years; rare earth mining occupied 11.354 4 km2, whose average recovery time was 11 years, and the recovery of the reclamation area was 5.004 9 km2, so there was still 6.349 5 km2 area with the regional vegetation that did not be recovered, and relevant departments should pay attention to the situation. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Satellite Altimetry For Ocean And Coastal Applications: A Review,"More than 30 years of observations from an international suite of satellite altimeter missions continue to provide key data enabling research discoveries and a broad spectrum of operational and user-driven applications. These missions were designed to advance technologies and to answer scientific questions about ocean circulation, ocean heat content, and the impact of climate change on these Earth systems. They are also a valuable resource for the operational needs of oceanographic and weather forecasting agencies that provide information to shipping and fishing vessels and offshore operations for route optimization and safety, as well as for other decision makers in coastal, water resources, and disaster management fields. This time series of precise measurements of ocean surface topography (OST)-the ""hills and valleys"" of the ocean surface-reveals changes in ocean dynamic topography, tracks sea level variations at global to regional scales, and provides key information about ocean trends reflecting climate change in our warming world. Advancing technologies in new satellite systems allows measurements at higher spatial resolution ever closer to coastlines, where the impacts of storms, waves, and sea level rise on coastal communities and infrastructure are manifest. We review some collaborative efforts of international space agencies, including NASA, CNES, NOAA, ESA, and EUMETSAT, which have contributed to a collection of use cases of satellite altimetry in operational and decision-support contexts. The extended time series of ocean surface topography measurements obtained from these satellite altimeter missions, along with advances in satellite technology that have allowed for higher resolution measurements nearer to coasts, has enabled a range of such applications. The resulting body of knowledge and data enables better assessments of storms, waves, and sea level rise impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure amongst other key contributions for societal benefit. Although not exhaustive, this review provides a broad overview with specific examples of the important role of satellite altimetry in ocean and coastal applications, thus justifying the significant resource contributions made by international space agencies in the development of these missions.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15163939,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
"New Ocean, New Needs: Application Of Pteropod Shell Dissolution As A Biological Indicator For Marine Resource Management","Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

Hyperspectral Assessment Of Soil Fertility In Farm Fields In Fukushima Decontaminated After The Radioactive Fallout,"Farmland in the Fukushima region of Japan experienced unprecedented radioactive contamination as a result of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster in 2011. Many fields (4,950 ha; over 30,000 fields to date) have been decontaminated by replacing the top surface soil with non-contaminated soil. However, the fertility of these fields is quite low and within-field heterogeneity is marked. Accordingly, appropriate management of soil and fertilizer is required for recovery of crop productivity in these decontaminated fields. Remote sensing can play a critical role in rapid spatial assessment of soil fertility. This preliminary study investigated the potential of spectral sensing approaches based on hyperspectral reflectance measurements (400-2500 nm) of soil samples from a decontaminated paddy field in the Fukushima region. Spectral index algorithms (the ratio spectral index {[}RSI] and normalized difference spectral index {[}NDSI]) and multivariate regression methods (partial least-squares regression {[}PLSR] and interval PLSR {[}iPLSR]) were used to identify accurate, robust predictive models. The iPLSR and PLSR showed higher predictive accuracy than the other methods (r(val)(2) = 0.937 and 0.802, respectively). The best spectral indices explored using RSI and NDSI have good potential for assessing the spatial variability of soil carbon content (SC; r(val)(2) = 0.730 similar to 0.844), despite using only two wavebands. The results from the RSI map (or NDSI map) approach provided useful information for creating optimal algorithms for assessing SC values using various sensors, including high-resolution optical satellite sensors. Although we must note that optimal algorithms and their applicability are often site-specific depending on soil type and surface conditions, our results imply that these spectral sensing methods can contribute to the recovery of soil fertility of decontaminated fields in the Fukushima region through careful calibration/validation procedures with sufficient in situ data.",2020,"{""Inoue, Yoshio"",""Iwasaki, Akira"",""Nemoto, Tomoaki"",""Ono, Tsukasa"",""Saito, Takashi""}",10.1080/00380768.2020.1753237,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Mapping Property Redevelopment Via Geoai: Integrating Computer Vision And Socioenvironmental Patterns And Processes,"Domain knowledge of social and environmental sciences is generally derived from less structured small data and/or small models. The integration of deep learning with socioenvironmental and geographical patterns and processes is still in an early phase. This study proposes a flexible framework that synthesizes computer vision with patterns and processes of geographical phenomena (e.g., urban redevelopment) via deep convolutional neural networks and spatiotemporal neighborhoods, respectively. Meanwhile, undesirable visual cues (e.g., temporary objects such as cars) cause false alarms in urban change detection. Thus, a masked deep pyramid similarity model (i.e., the computer vision model) is proposed to minimize the negative impact of nonbuilding changes. This pipeline has robustness against obfuscation of undesirable street scene changes and elasticity of geographical knowledge representations in mapping property redevelopment. This model is reproducible and adaptable due to the wide availability of SVI and flexibility of the framework. The results suggest that the domain-driven rules and nonbuilding change masking mechanism can significantly increase the accuracy of a computer vision model. We also find that urban redevelopment should be understood as a locally tuned back-to-the-city process with weak replicability. Hybrid gentrification (i.e., the combination of “seesaw” gentrification and continuous gentrification) is observed globally with local variations. Takeaway for practice: First, the population of those affected should be carefully identified and the benefits of gentrification need to be redistributed on a larger scale. For Auckland, decision-makers should not divert attention away from low-income tenants in outer suburbs that slipped below the radar of local government and scholars. Second, more attention should be given to less resourcing neighborhoods in constantly gentrifying neighborhoods when governments formulate and implement housing subsidy policies. Locally, incessant redevelopment in Auckland CBD, New Market and Remuera, etc., should be contained. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2024,"{""Liu, C."",""Song, W.""}",10.1016/j.cities.2023.104644,"{""computer viz model""}",excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Impact Of Time Separation On Coordination In Global Software Teams: A Conceptual Foundation,"While there has been much research on the study of global virtual teams and global software teams, there has been practically no research on the nuances of time separation. We present three converging perspectives on this topic: (a) a view from practices and tactics of global teams; (b) a theoretical view from coordination theories; and (c) a view from our prior research in which we modeled coordination costs for time-separated dyads. Practice suggests that time separation arises not only from time-zone differences but also from factors such as nonoverlapping weekend days and holidays, shifts, and different working schedules. It also suggests that teams employ various coping tactics when faced with time separation - synchronous, asynchronous, and education. Theory suggests that communication is necessary to coordinate and that effectiveness of communication is hampered, both in quality and timeliness, when teams are separated by time. Our model, based on coordination theory, suggests that coordination costs contain four main components - communication, clarification, delay, and rework - and that the various aspects of time-separated work have different effects on each of these components. Our convergent view from these three perspectives shows that distance separation is symmetric - i.e. distance (A,B) = distance (B,A) - while time separation is asymmetric, which affects the planning of team interactions; that the timing of activities matters in time-separated contexts but not in contexts with only distance separation; and that vulnerability costs (i.e. resolving misunderstandings and rework) increase with time separation.

The Annual Cycle For Whimbrel Populations Using The Western Atlantic Flyway,"Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring. The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground, arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high (98\%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes. The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high conservation value.",2021,"{""Duval, Laura"",""Hamilton, Diana J."",""Hines, Chance"",""Keyes, Tim"",""Paquet, Julie"",""Pirie-Dominix, Lisa"",""Rausch, Jennie"",""Smith, Fletcher M."",""Truitt, Barry"",""Watts, Bryan D."",""Winn, Brad"",""Woodard, Paul""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0260339,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Impact Of Landscape Patterns On Ecosystem Services In China: A Case Study Of The Central Plains Urban Agglomeration,"Urban agglomeration is the highest stage of urban development, which reasonable planning will be conducive to the rapid and healthy development of the regional economy. However, in recent years, unreasonable urban agglomeration planning has changed landscape patterns and brought huge challenges to ecosystem services. Moreover, there is currently a lack of understanding of the relationship between landscape patterns and ecosystem services, especially in the process of urban agglomeration construction. In this study, we attempt to reveal the impact of landscape patterns on ecosystem services value (ESV) based on many years of remote sensing data in the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA). The results show that landscape patterns have significant spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, and there are significant differences between different landscape patterns in the CPUA. Moreover, most of landscape patterns show significant east-west differences. Total ESV has decreased from USD 838.53 million in 2000 to USD 792.32 million in 2018. From a spatial perspective, the areas with high ESV are mostly distributed in the western mountainous and southern hilly areas, but low ESV area are mainly concentrated in the central and northern plains. In addition, the results of model analysis reveal that there is a remarkable positive correlation between ESV and patch density, interspersion juxtaposition index, cohesion index, and splitting index, but a remarkable negative correlation between ESV and total edge. These results provide critical guidance and suggestions for the improvement of future urban agglomeration construction.

A Survey Of Blockchain-Based Strategies For Healthcare,"Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons. © 2020 ACM.",NA,NA,10.1145/3376915,{spurious},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Seasonal Forecasts For The Limpopo Province In Estimating Deviations From Grazing Capacity,"Application of seasonal forecasts in agriculture has significant potential and realized utility. Other sectors that may also benefit from using seasonal forecasts include (but are not limited to) health, hydrology, water, and energy. This paper shows that seasonal forecast model data, satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), dry matter productivity (DMP) data (proxy of grass biomass) along with other sets of data are effectively used to estimate grazing capacity (GC) over a 12-year test period (1998/1999–2009/2010) in Limpopo Province. GC comprises a vital consideration in agricultural activities, particularly for a province in South Africa like Limpopo, due to its varying climate. The Limpopo Province capitalizes on subsistence farming, including livestock and crop production. Grazing should thus be regulated in order to conserve grass, shrubs, and trees, thereby ensuring sustainability of rangelands. In a statistical downscaling model, the predictor is the 850 geopotential height fields of a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation (CGCM) over Southern Africa to predict seasonal DMP values. This model shows that the mid-summer rainfall totals are important predictors for the November through April (NDJFMA) DMP (as well as grazing capacity) growing season. Forecast verification is conducted using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and reliability diagrams. The CGCM model shows skill in discriminating high and low DMP (GC) seasons in the Limpopo Province, as well as reliability in the probabilistic forecasts. This paper demonstrates the development of a tailored forecast, an avenue that should be explored in enhancing relevance of forecasts in agricultural production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,10.1007/s00704-018-2696-x,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
"Quantitative Catchment Profiling To Apportion Faecal Indicator Organism Budgets For The Ribble System, The Uk's Sentinel Drainage Basin For Water Framework Directive Research","Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20/60/EC and the US Federal Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within river drainage basins has shifted from traditional point-source control to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive (BWD), under the list of 'protected areas' in the WFD places a requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within catchments in order to achieve the objectives of both the BWD (and its revision - 2006/7/EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44-day period during the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90\% of the total organism load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However, during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater retention tanks. The study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure and WwTW stormwater retention tanks as the dominant component of the high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde coast and the associated bathing waters.

A New Temperature-Vegetation Triangle Algorithm With Variable Edges (Tave) For Satellite-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation,"The estimation of spatially-variable actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a critical challenge to regional water resources management. We propose a new remote sensing method, the Triangle Algorithm with Variable Edges (TAVE), to generate daily AET estimates based on satellite-derived land surface temperature and the vegetation index NDVI. The TAVE captures heterogeneity in AET across elevation zones and permits variability in determining local values of wet and dry end-member classes (known as edges). Compared to traditional triangle methods, TAVE introduces three unique features: (i) the discretization of the domain as overlapping elevation zones; (ii) a variable wet edge that is a function of elevation zone; and (iii) variable values of a combined-effect parameter (that accounts for aerodynamic and surface resistance, vapor pressure gradient, and soil moisture availability) along both wet and dry edges. With these features, TAVE effectively addresses the combined influence of terrain and water stress on semi-arid environment AET estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in one of the driest countries in the worldJordan, and compare it to a traditional triangle method (TA) and a global AET product (MOD16) over different land use types. In irrigated agricultural lands, TAVE matched the results of the single crop coefficient model (-3\%), in contrast to substantial overestimation by TA (+234\%) and underestimation by MOD16 (-50\%). In forested (non-irrigated, water consuming) regions, TA and MOD16 produced AET average deviations 15.5 times and -3.5 times of those based on TAVE. As TAVE has a simple structure and low data requirements, it provides an efficient means to satisfy the increasing need for evapotranspiration estimation in data-scarce semi-arid regions. This study constitutes a much needed step towards the satellite-based quantification of agricultural water consumption in Jordan.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs8090735,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Spatiotemporal Continuous Estimates Of Daily 1 Km Pm2.5 From 2000 To Present Under The Tracking Air Pollution In China (Tap) Framework,"High spatial resolution PM2.5 data covering a long time period are urgently needed to support population exposure assessment and refined air quality management. In this study, we provided complete-coverage PM2.5 predictions with a 1 km spatial resolution from 2000 to the present under the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/, last access: 3 October 2022) framework. To support high spatial resolution modeling, we collected PM2.5 measurements from both national and local monitoring stations. To correctly reflect the temporal variations in land cover characteristics that affected the local variations in PM2.5, we constructed continuous annual geoinformation datasets, including the road maps and ensemble gridded population maps, in China from 2000 to 2021. We also examined various model structures and predictor combinations to balance the computational cost and model performance. The final model fused 10 km TAP PM2.5 predictions from our previous work, 1 km satellite aerosol optical depth retrievals, and land use parameters with a random forest model. Our annual model had an out-of-bag R-2 ranging between 0.80 and 0.84, and our hindcast model had a by-year cross-validation R-2 of 0.76. This open-access, 1 km resolution PM2.5 data product, with complete coverage, successfully revealed the local-scale spatial variations in PM2.5 and could benefit environmental studies and policymaking.",NA,NA,10.5194/acp-22-13229-2022,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Variability Of Water Use Efficiency Associated With Climate Change In The Extreme West Of Bahia,"Water has become more important in agricultural implementations over the years, as has the need for water management. Thus, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) has been used as an alternative form of detecting the variability of water management based on the carbon-water cycle. The study aimed to map and quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of WUE based on its interactions with environmental changes. It focused on an agricultural area in the westernmost region of Bahia, Northeast Brazil (NEB). For WUE estimation, data from Collection 6 MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Evapotranspiration (ET) products with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees were obtained from the Earth Explorer website. Subsequently, annual WUE anomalies were calculated based on the 2001-2019 period. The results obtained indicated that the highest values of GPP (580 gC/m(2)), ET (3000 mm), and WUE (3.5 gC/mm center dot m(2)) occurred in agricultural areas, associated with cultural treatments and insertion of irrigation, which helped in the higher WUE values and consequently increased agricultural productivity in the study region. In addition, there was a marked influence of the phases of the climate variability mode-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-on the annual variability of the WUE, with a reduction of 96\% during the La Nina of 2016 (an increase of 89\% during El Nino of 2005). During El Ninos, vegetation had greater efficiency resulting from the adaptation of vegetation in maintaining the carbon-water balance, using water more efficiently. However, unlike Las Ninas, with excessive precipitation there is an interference in the WUE, which interferes with the absorption of radiation and nutrients for the biophysical processes of vegetation and agriculture and, consequently, agricultural production. The use of WUE for agriculture is extremely important, especially for Brazil and countries with an economy based on primary production. This information on the way vegetation (native or agricultural) responds to interactions with the environment aids in decision-making about water management, possibly lowering losses or agricultural damage caused by a lack of water.",NA,NA,10.3390/su142316004,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Spatial-Spectral Clustering With Anchor Graph For Hyperspectral Image,"Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering, which aims at dividing hyperspectral pixels into clusters without labeled training data, has drawn significant attention in practical applications. Recently, many graph-based clustering methods, which construct an adjacent graph to model the data relationship, have shown dominant performance. However, the high dimensionality of HSI data makes it hard to construct the pairwise adjacent graph. Besides, abundant spatial structures are often overlooked during the clustering procedure. To better handle the high dimensionality problem and preserve the spatial structures, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach called spatial-spectral clustering with anchor graph (SSCAG) for HSI data clustering. The SSCAG has the following contributions: 1) the multiscale filtering module is utilized to smooth the homogeneous regions, so that it can increase the similarity and consistency of neighboring pixels and capture the multiple views of a local region with different scales; 2) a new similarity metric is proposed to embed the spatial-spectral features into the combined adjacent graph, which can mine the intrinsic property structure of HSI data; and 3) the anchor graph (AG)-based strategy is adopted to construct the adjacent graph by a neighbor assignment scheme without hyperparameters, and its optimization employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to replace eigenvalue decomposition to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive experiments on three public HSI datasets show that the proposed SSCAG is competitive against the state-of-the-art approaches. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",2022,"{""Chen, M."",""Miao, Y."",""Wang, Q."",""Yuan, Y.""}",10.1109/tgrs.2022.3217597,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context""}"
Model-Assisted Regional Forest Biomass Estimation Using Lidar And Insar As Auxiliary Data: A Case Study From A Boreal Forest Area,"There is a need for accurate inventory methods that produce relevant and timely information on the forest resources and carbon stocks for forest management planning and for implementation of national strategies under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD). Such methods should produce information that is consistent across various geographical scales. Airborne scanning Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is among the most promising remote sensing technologies for estimation of forest resource information such as timber volume and biomass, while acquisition of three dimensional data with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from space is seen as a relevant option for inventory in the tropics because of its ability to ""see through the clouds"" and its potential for frequent updates at low costs. Based on a stratified probability sample of 201 field survey plots collected in a 960 km(2) boreal forest area in Norway, we demonstrate how total above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated at three distinct geographical levels in such a way that the estimates at a smaller level always sum up to the estimate at a larger level. The three levels are (1) a district (the entire study area), (2) a village, local community or estate level, and (3) a stand or patch level. The LiDAR and InSAR data were treated as auxiliary information in the estimation. At the two largest geographical levels model-assisted estimators were employed. A model-based estimation was conducted at the smallest level. Estimates of AGB and corresponding error estimates based on (1) the field sample survey were compared with estimates obtained by using (2) LiDAR and (3) InSAR data as auxiliary information. For the entire study area, the estimates of AGB were 116.0, 101.2, and 111.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Corresponding standard error estimates were 3.7, 1.6, and 3.2 Mg ha(-1). At the smallest geographical level (stand) an independent validation on 35 large field plots was carried out. RMSE values of 17.1-17.3 Mg ha(-1) and 42.6-53.2 Mg ha(-1) were found for LiDAR and InSAR, respectively. A time lag of six years between acquisition of InSAR data and field inventory has introduced some errors. Significant differences between estimates and reference values were found, illustrating the risk of using pure model-based methods in the estimation when there is a lack of fit in the models. We conclude that the examined remote sensing techniques can provide biomass estimates with smaller estimated errors than a field-based sample survey. The improvement can be highly significant, especially for LiDAR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Efficient Storage Method For Massive Remote Sensing Image Via Spark-Based Pyramid Model,"The amount of remote sensing (RS) image has grown considerably and the Big Data era of images has truly emerged. Traditional storage and processing methods cannot meet the requirements of the growing massive image data. So how to provide effective storage and high-performance computation service has brought a great challenge to the research community. In this paper, we present the efficient storage of massive remote sensing image via Spark-based Pyramid model. Based on selection of rational number of image layer via the maximum division layer algorithm, we design the Spark-oriented distributed construction method. We use RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) on Spark system to represent data structures for metadata and ranks, and there is no need to materialize these data structures across multiple iterations. Using our construction method and RDDs caching technology, we design the efficient storage structure of RS image data, which can achieve high-performance processing of massive RS image on Spark system. Experimental results show that proper values can be obtained via optimization parameters of image tile. Also throughput rate and construction performance are much higher than MapReduce and Hadoop.",NA,NA,10.24507/ijicic.13.06.1915,"{""storage efficiency""}",excluded,"{""No societal value context""}"
Opti-Msfa: A Toolbox For Generalized Design And Optimization Of Multispectral Filter Arrays,"Multispectral imaging captures spatial information across a set of discrete spectral channels and is widely utilized across diverse applications such as remote sensing, industrial inspection, and biomedical imaging. Multispectral filter arrays (MSFAs) are filter mosaics integrated atop image sensors that facilitate cost-effective, compact, snapshot multispectral imaging. MSFAs are pre-configured based on application-where filter channels are selected corresponding to targeted absorption spectra-making the design of optimal MSFAs vital for a given application. Despite the availability of many design and optimization approaches for spectral channel selection and spatial arrangement, major limitations remain. There are few robust approaches for joint spectral-spatial optimization, techniques are typically only applicable to limited datasets and most critically, are not available for general use and improvement by the wider community. Here, we reconcile current MSFA design techniques and present Opti-MSFA: a Python-based open-access toolbox for the centralized design and optimization of MSFAs. Opti-MSFA incorporates established spectral-spatial optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and simulated annealing, multispectral-RGB image reconstruction, and is applicable to user-defined input of spatial-spectral datasets or imagery. We demonstrate the utility of the toolbox by comparing against other published MSFAs using the standard hyperspectral datasets Samson and Jasper Ridge, and further show application on experimentally acquired fluorescence imaging data. In conjunction with end-user input and collaboration, we foresee the continued development of Opti-MSFA for the benefit of the wider research community.

Collective Forest Tenure Reform And Forest Conditions: Evidence From The Social-Ecological System In Southwest China,"China's recent collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve forest conditions by devolution of forest management rights from community collectives to individual households. Studies reveal substantial local variation in CFTR implementation, but the ecological effects and underlying mechanism have received little attention. Our study focused on community-managed forests and household-managed forests in four communities located in the mountains of Southwest China. The objective was to investigate the relationship between CFTR and forest conditions at the local scale. We employed a combination of remote sensing technology, field forest observations and socioeconomic surveys to gather data for analysis. The results showed that the forest cover change trends of collective forests and household forests in each community were consistent from 1994 to 2014. There was no significant relationship between CFTR implementation and local-level differences in species diversity and soil fertility in forests. The aboveground biomass of collective forests was significantly higher than that of household forests. Differentiated access and use, low compensation amounts, and loose payment terms jointly affected CFTR's effectiveness to improve local-scale forest conditions in the study area. Attempts to formalize forest tenure rights must be flexible enough and adapted to the local environment so that changes induced by the CFTR can improve local access to forest resources and its benefits.",NA,NA,10.3389/ffgc.2023.1162058,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

A Blind Convolutional Deep Autoencoder For Spectral Unmixing Of Hyperspectral Images Over Waterbodies,"Harmful algal blooms have dangerous repercussions for biodiversity, the ecosystem, and public health. Automatic identification based on remote sensing hyperspectral image analysis provides a valuable mechanism for extracting the spectral signatures of harmful algal blooms and their respective percentage in a region of interest. This paper proposes a new model called a non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing to perform endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation. The model is assessed in benchmark datasets, such as Jasper Ridge and Samson. Additionally, a case study of the HSI2 image acquired by NASA over Lake Erie in 2017 is conducted for extracting optical water types. The results using the proposed model for the benchmark datasets improve unmixing performance, as indicated by the spectral angle distance compared to five baseline algorithms. Improved results were obtained for various metrics. In the Samson dataset, the proposed model outperformed other methods for water (0.060) and soil (0.025) endmember extraction. Moreover, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in terms of mean spectral angle distance compared to the other five baseline algorithms. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing approach achieved better results for abundance map estimation, with a root mean square error of 0.091 for water and 0.187 for soil, compared to the ground truth. For the Jasper Ridge dataset, the non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing model excelled in the tree (0.039) and road (0.068) endmember extraction and also demonstrated improved results for water abundance maps (0.1121). The proposed model can identify the presence of chlorophyll-a in waterbodies. Chlorophyll-a is an essential indicator of the presence of the different concentrations of macrophytes and cyanobacteria. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing achieves a value of 0.307 for the spectral angle distance metric compared to a reference ground truth spectral signature of chlorophyll-a.

The Role Of Habitat Features In Patterns Of Population Connectivity Of Two Mediterranean Amphibians In Arid Landscapes Of Central Iberia,"Context Mediterranean wetland ecosystems are in continuous decline due to human pressure. Amphibians are key elements of biotic communities of Mediterranean temporary ponds and streams, and their persistence depends on the availability and inter-connectivity of breeding sites. Objectives We investigated the role of different factors potentially driving functional connectivity patterns in two amphibian species at the landscape and local scales. We focused on two Mediterranean endemic pond-breeding amphibians inhabiting semi-arid landscapes of central Spain, the common parsley frog (Pelodytes punctatus) and the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans). Methods We genotyped 336 individuals of P. punctatus and 318 of A. obstetricans from 17 and 16 breeding populations at 10 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. We used remotely sensed vegetation/moisture indices and land use/cover data to derive optimized resistance surfaces and test their association with estimates of gene flow and migration rates across populations. Results We found evidence for higher population connectivity in common midwife toads than in common parsley frogs, with a strong effect of water availability in patterns of population connectivity of both species. However, the two species differ in the role of landscape features on population connectivity, with the distance and spatial distribution of artificial land-use types positively influencing connectivity in A. obstetricans and meadows/pastureland favouring P. punctatus. This is in line with reported breeding site preferences for the two species, with A. obstetricans successfully breeding in artificial water bodies that P. punctatus generally avoid. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of assessing species-habitat relationships shaping connectivity when developing and implementing conservation and management actions to benefit fragmented amphibian populations in the Mediterranean region. Our results show that amphibian species respond differently, even contrastingly to landscape features and thus require alternative, complementary strategies to improve population connectivity and ensure long-term viability.",2023,"{""Caballero-Diaz, Carlos"",""Civantos, Emilio"",""Goncalves, Helena"",""Goncalves, Joao"",""Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Jorge"",""Maia-Carvalho, Bruno"",""Martinez-Solano, Inigo""}",10.1007/s10980-022-01548-z,"{""spurious terra""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Long-Term Spatiotemporal Variability In High Andean Wetlands In Northern Chile,"High Andean wetlands of the elevated plateaus of the Andes Mountains of Chile, Argentina, Perú and Bolivia are true oases that sustain life in this arid region. Despite their ecological value, they have been rarely studied and are vulnerable to climate change and human activities that require groundwater resources. One such activity that may be intensified in the near future is mining for nonmetallic minerals such as lithium, whose worldwide demand is expected to increase with the rise of electric vehicles that need batteries. To determine a baseline of the natural dynamics of these systems, which allows sustainable management, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wetlands. In this article, we studied the temporal and spatial dynamics of high Andean wetlands of Chile, with the aim of identifying the key processes that govern their dynamics. To do this, we used time series of Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 to study 10 high Andean wetlands. Furthermore, to characterize the climate variability in these systems, we studied the long-term relation between the changes in water and vegetation areas with rainfall and evaporation variability. It was found that the groundwater reservoir plays a key role in sustaining the high Andean wetlands. Wet years with a period of occurrence of 20–30 years are the years in which the groundwater reservoirs are actually recharged, and in between wet years, the groundwater reservoirs gradually release the water that sustains the aquatic ecosystems. Hence, groundwater exploitation should be carefully designed from a long-term perspective, as groundwater levels could take decades to recover. © 2020 The Authors",NA,NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143830,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Implication Of Drainage Basin Parameters Of Chhoti Gandak River, Ganga Plain, India","The drainage basin parameters of the groundwater-fed Chhoti Gandak River originating in the terai area of the Ganga Plain were analyzed using topographical sheets, satellite data, and field documentation with emphasis to its implication for flood mitigation and recharging of groundwater. The analyses indicate dominance of first order streams, gentle slope gradient, low surface run-off, low sediment production, high infiltration rate, and low value of basin relief. The low water storage capacity, spreading of water and concentration of peak discharge in the distal part of the river basin explain that whenever precipitation is high in the catchment area there is flood in the distal part of the basin. The bifurcation ratio value (4.34) of this basin describes that the drainage is carved naturally by slope and local relief and not influenced by geological structures like lineaments and faults. These parameters provide useful information for the prediction of basin behavior during prolonged heavy rainfall that generate floods and suggest that water resource management and developmental planning should be done with reference to the drainage basin parameters.",2011,"{""Awasthi, Amit"",""Sen Singh, Dhruv""}",10.1007/s12594-011-0102-8,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Distribution Characteristics And Influencing Factors Of Milk-Tea Consumption Space From The Perspective Of Scene-Symbol And Physical-Information,"In the era of digital economy, the influence of new retail consumption space which combines scene consumption and symbol consumption, and physical space and information space, on the development of urban space is constantly expanding. Taking the consumption space of milk-tea in Xi 'an as the research object, space syntax is used to analyze the distribution characteristics of milk-tea consumption space. Threshold regression and multi- scale geographical weighted regression are constructed to analyze the influencing factors of the distribution of milk-tea consumption space. The results show that: (1) Location selection for new retail milk-tea is highly sensitive to market information and can respond to space regulatory decisions. The factors involved in the traditional retail location theory, such as consumer market, spatial proximity, land price, and industrial development, have a significant impact on the spatial distribution of new retail milk-tea consumption. However, there is a game between physical and information entities in new retail milk-tea consumption space, with the role of information growing significantly with the expansion of scale; (2) The spatial distribution of new retail milk-tea consumption reflects the characteristics of organizational behaviors displayed by brand community. The consumption subjectivity of consumer community is enhanced. The new retail milk-tea consumption space of different brands promotes the growth of consumer communities in various ways; (3) Social culture perception has price threshold effect in both physical and information consumption space. Information flow and material flow are mutually exclusive in the action mechanism of low-priced consumption space scene and symbol value, and cultural dissemination depends on the density, propagation rate, and frequency of scene and symbol. In the action mechanism of high-priced consumption space scene and symbol value, information flow and material flow promote each other, and cultural dissemination depends on the influence and propagation distance of scene and symbol; (4) Spatial syntactic model simulates the extension of information in the consumption space. Threshold regression and multi-scale geographical weighted regression reveal the production and reproduction mechanism of new retail consumption space.

"Vertical And Horizontal Habitat Use By White Marlin Kajikia Albida (Poey, 1860) In The Western North Atlantic Ocean","Pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on 40 white marlin Kajika albida (synonym: Tetrapturus albidus) off the coasts of Maryland and North Carolina (United States), and the island nation of Aruba in the Caribbean. Useful data were available for analysing vertical and horizontal habitat use from 28 individuals. Time at liberty ranged from 10 to 181 d (mean 115, SD 53.3). Seasonal southerly fall migration routes were documented for fish released off the northeastern United States, while those released off Aruba remained in the Caribbean basin. Horizontal movements ranged from 228 to 8084 km (19-100 km d(-1)) based on light-level geolocation estimates using a sea surface temperature and bathymetry-corrected Kalman filter. Analyses included an evaluation of vertical movements using Delta T, the time spent at temperature relative to the uniform temperature surface layer. Movements included exploration of depths as great as 387 m and ambient temperatures as low as 7.8 degrees C. However, the greatest proportion of time was spent in the upper 20 m of the water column for both day (50.8\%) and night (81.6\%), and time spent in water colder than 7 degrees C below the uniform temperature surface layer was negligible. Overall, this group showed less variability in vertical movement, and less tolerance to colder temperatures compared with similar studies for blue marlin Makaira nigricans and sailfish Istiophorus platypterus. Values for Delta T are presented in tabular format to allow direct input into habitat standardization models used to estimate vertical distribution and population abundance.

In GP, the spatial coverage of BL has shrunk by 100.4 km(2) every year over the past three decades. Similarly, BuA exhibits an annual decreasing rate of 42.4 km(2) due to the effect of dense vegetation coverage within the same land use type. Meanwhile, water bodies, marine quarries, arable lands, grasslands, shrublands, dense forests, and wetlands were expanded annually by 1.3, 2.3, 2.9, 5.6, 11.2, 29.6, and 89.5 km(2), respectively. The surface water content level of the study area has been poor throughout the study years. The MNDWI and NDWI values have a stronger Pearson correlation at a radius of 5 km (r = 0.60, p = 0.000, n = 87,260) than at 10 and 15 km. This research is essential to improve current land-use planning and surface water management techniques to reduce the environmental impacts of land-use change.",2023,"{""Gidey, Eskinder"",""Mhangara, Paidamwoyo""}",10.3390/rs15164092,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Ecosystem Service Valuation Of A Natural Reserve Region For Sustainable Management Of Natural Resources,"The mangrove ecosystem is extremely important for providing essential ecosystem services, which are crucial for subsistence and human well-being. Using time-series satellite data products and different unit values, the spatially explicit Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) of six eco-regions of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, has been calculated for four reference years, viz. 1973, 1988, 2002 and 2013. The maximum ESV (million US\$ year(1)) is provided by the mangrove forest (2292-44468), followed by water surface (65-4244), cropland (26-3938), and sparse vegetation cover (0-326). The total ESV (million US\$ year(1)) of Sundarbans is estimated to be 16629.5, 20175.7, 19733.4, and 16761.3 for 1973, 1988, 2002, and 2013 respectively. The regulation of gas and climate, raw material production, and cultural ecosystem services are entirely dependent on the mangrove ecosystem, while the waste treatment, cultural, and water regulation services are found to be highly sensitive to the changes in water bodies. The food production and biodiversity services exhibiting higher sensitivity to the changes in cropland, water regulation and soil formation and retention services show higher sensitivity to the changes in mixed vegetation cover. The current study has thoroughly evaluated the sensitivity and response behavior of six ecoregions of Sundarbans. The outcome of this study will enable the decision-makers, planners, as well as researchers to adopt necessary action plans for strengthening and protecting the natural resources of this biosphere reserve.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.indic.2019.100014,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Stock-Scale Electronic Tracking Of Atlantic Halibut Reveals Summer Site Fidelity And Winter Mixing On Common Spawning Grounds,"Knowledge of movement ecology, habitat use, and spatiotemporal distribution is critical to inform sustainable fisheries management and conservation. Atlantic halibut in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) is of great economic value, although little is known about its spatiotemporal distribution, seasonal migrations, and spawning areas. To investigate these aspects, 114 pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) were deployed on halibut from 2013 up to 2018 throughout the GSL. A total of 62 physically recovered PSATs provided complete archived datasets with high temporal resolution. PSAT detachment locations revealed specific summer site fidelity. In contrast, the reconstruction of movement tracks with a geolocation model revealed that all fish converged to the Gulf's deep channels to overwinter and spawn. This suggests strong mixing during the spawning period and thus one reproductive population within the GSL. These findings illustrate the utility of large-scale PSAT tagging combined with dedicated PSAT-recovery surveys to reveal critical stock-scale information on movements and spawning locations. This information addresses important gaps in the movement ecology of this halibut stock, revealing that reported summer site fidelity, based on years of conventional tagging, also conceals important winter mixing that is only apparent through analyses of movement on the time scale of annual cycles.",2020,"{""Fisher, Jonathan A.

Forest Stand Spectrum Reconstruction Using Spectrum Spatial Feature Gathering And Multilayer Perceptron,"Introduction: Three-dimensional spectral distributions of forest stands can provide spatial information on the physiological and biochemical status of forests, which is vital for forest management. However, three-dimensional spectral studies of forest stands are limited. Methods: In this study, LiDAR and multispectral data were collected from Masson pine stands in southern Fujian Province, China, and a method was proposed for inverting forest spectra using point clouds as a unit. First, multispectral values were mapped to a point cloud, and the isolated forest algorithm combined with K-means clustering was applied to characterize fusion data. Second, five deep learning algorithms were selected for semantic segmentation, and the overall accuracy (oAcc) and mean intersection ratio (mIoU) were used to evaluate the performance of various algorithms on the fusion data set. Third, the semantic segmentation model was used to reconfigure the class 3D spectral distribution, and the model inversion outcomes were evaluated by the peaks and valleys of the curve of the predicted values and distribution gaps. Results: The results show that the correlations between spectral attributes and between spatial attributes were both greater than 0.98, while the correlation between spectral and spatial attributes was 0.43. The most applicable method was PointMLP, highest oAcc was 0.84, highest mIoU was 0.75, peak interval of the prediction curve tended to be consistent with the true values, and maximum difference between the predicted value and the true value of the point cloud spectrum was 0.83. Discussion: Experimental data suggested that combining spatial fusion and semantic segmentation effectively inverts three-dimensional spectral information for forest stands. The model could meet the accuracy requirements of local spectral inversion, and the NIR values of stands in different regions were correlated with the vertical height of the canopy and the distance from the tree apex in the region. These findings improve our understanding of the precise three-dimensional spectral distribution of forests, providing a basis for near-earth remote sensing of forests and the estimation of forest stand health.

Potential Of Using Data Assimilation To Support Forest Planning,"Uncertainty in forest information typically results in economic and ecological losses as a consequence of suboptimal management decisions. Several techniques have been proposed to handle such uncertainties. However, these techniques are often complex and costly. Data assimilation (DA) has recently been advocated as a tool that may reduce the uncertainty, thereby improving the quality of forest planning results. It offers an opportunity to make use of all new sources of information in a systematic way and thus provides more accurate and up-to-date information to forest planning. In this study, we refer to literature on handling uncertainties in forest planning, as well as related literature from other scientific fields, to assess the potential benefits of using DA in forest planning. We identify five major potential benefits: (i) the accuracy of the information will be improved; (ii) the information will be kept up to date; (iii) the DA process will provide information with estimated accuracy; (iv) stochastic decision making can be applied whereby the accuracy of the information can be utilized in the decision making process; and (v) DA data allows for the analysis of optimal data acquisition decisions.",NA,NA,10.1139/cjfr-2016-0439,{},excluded,"{""Valued data is not ESI""}"
Density-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm For Data Clustering,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used in cluster analysis. However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",NA,NA,10.1016/j.eswa.2017.08.050,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
