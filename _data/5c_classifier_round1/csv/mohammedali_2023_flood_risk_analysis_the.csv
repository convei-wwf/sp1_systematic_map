2,introduction a flood is a disaster situation that may happen have been several alternative approaches due to both natural and human activities.
2,"in created to reduce the impact of flooding addition to the damage to properties, floods through a process called flood mitigation; some substantially impact the living situations of mitigation strategies necessitate the people affected by floods, as floods create installation of structures to regulate the flow of economic disruption or halting, as well as water in its canal, while others aim to reduce population emigration [1]."
2,"some floods result the rate of water flow on the earth [9, 10]. from the rapid melting of ice in the spring or however, these solutions increase the problem rare cases such as the collapse of a dam. because producing these materials harms the however, much flooding is the result of the environment besides its high cost and logistic overflowing of river banks."
2,"flooding in rivers work [11, 12]."
2,"in addition, several studies stated results in numerous financial and personal that a structural strategy alone would not be losses."
2,"flooding happens when a river's water enough to prevent repeated flood hazards [11]. level increases and exceeds its overall storage flood risk mapping is thus an essential non- capacity, pushing the extra water over the structural approach [13]."
2,"however, if proper banks and drowning low-lying areas."
2,"another flood risk management measures and factor that may influence the incidence of floods knowledge about flood-prone locations are is the development of economic and social accessible ahead of time, the associated hazards activities and changes in land use in flood- can be reduced [14]."
2,"such events cannot be prone areas, as these actions modify prevented; however, it becomes possible, with floodplains' response to flood risk [2, 3]."
2,"many advances in technology, to identify areas prone agricultural regions, particularly those near to flooding, potential flood depths, and the river banks and at risk of flooding, are being extent and can eventually be used to create a used as residential areas as a result of the rapid flood risk map and can be used to aid decision- increase in the population [4]."
2,one of the most making in the event of an emergency.
2,"with the significant challenges in water resources development of technology and the huge engineering is the management of flood computer revolution, flood management has disasters and the predictions of unexpected become possible."
2,"understanding the dynamic changes in the water level of rivers, especially in behavior of floods, their causes, and their the residential areas close to the riverbanks of impacts can be done with the help of numerical the rivers."
2,"over the last decades, the issue of modeling approaches."
2,the sort of model and floods and their control has become critical due simulation equations and how accurate a model to their continuing occurrence.
2,federal is employed affect [15].
2,many studies were emergency management agency (fema) conducted to forecast the water surface claims that flooding is the second most frequent elevation downstream of rivers during flood natural disaster after fires in the united states events.
2,"indeed, most of these prediction studies [5]."
