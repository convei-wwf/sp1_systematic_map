1,a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t keywords: floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts.
1,the risk of nature-based solutions flooding increases when land use changes.
1,"the objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via flood hazard management sentinel-2 images in the umia basin (galicia, nw spain) in 2016–2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk."
1,"water governance this study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (nbs) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding land-use change, random forest, hec-hms, sentinel-2 in cities and crops in the high-risk area."
1,"a flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from sentinel-2 (observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and nbs, i.e."
1,"“s-upstream”, “s-downstream” and “s-total”."
1,"finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed."
1,land cover change was successfully monitored with sentinel-2 imagery.
1,"the catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021."
1,however riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11%.
1,"for the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3% for s-up; 8.6% for s-down and 13% for s-total)."
1,"from the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied."
1,"however, s-down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (€15,476,487), while s-up and s-total show better values at €29,580,643 and €65,158,130 respectively."
1,"however, investment cost is much higher for the s-total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so s-up is the best decision."
1,this study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory.
1,"this information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of nbs."
1,it has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable.
1,"this confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of nbs."
1,"introduction processes and environmental sustainability (nath et al., 2021)."
1,"these changes consist mainly of logging and destruction of vegetation on forest land use and land cover (lulc) are important because increased land, e.g. destruction of riparian vegetation (dewan and yamaguchi, urbanisation, industry and rural abandonment play important roles in 2009)."

2,"but today, natural solutions (launched on 7 march 2017)."
2,"one of the essential applications for such as nbs have been shown to complement or even successfully sentinel-2 data is lulc monitoring (bruzzone et al., 2017)."
2,"this has replace them (vojinovic et al., 2021)."

2,"all this will help land management decision which use sentinel-2 images (carrasco et al., 2019; forkuor et al., 2018; makers to do their job by providing better data, information and tools."
