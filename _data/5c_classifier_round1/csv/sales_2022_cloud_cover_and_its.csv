2,this programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to survival analysis periods of deforestation.
2,"due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, environmental policies weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation."
2,this paper investigates forest disturbance to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the deter-a program to detect deforestation.
2,"to test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation."
2,"the emphasis is on the state of maranhão, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (legal amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not."
2,"the results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program."
2,"coun­ terfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of co2 with a value of us$ 366 million."
2,"if the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument deter-c/deter intenso, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection."
2,"introduction more specifically, in 2004, the brazilian government created the action plan for the prevention and control of deforestation in the legal the clear-cutting of forests plays a central role in many of the envi­ amazon (ppcdam in portuguese), the purpose of which was to pay ronmental threats of our time, including global climate change, habitat closer attention to development planning, land use control, environ­ degradation, and species extinction."

2,"to where are these issues more clearly on display than in the brazilian control land use and prevent further deforestation, the ppcdam amazon that has seen the loss of 19 percent of its forest over the last 50 implemented two complementary satellite-based monitoring programs: years."
2,"one bright spot has been the decline in deforestation rates in (i) pro-des (programa de cálculo do desflorestamento da amazônia in brazil over the last decade, although there has been a resurgence in portuguese) (inpe, 2020) which records the annual rate of deforestation recent years."
2,"it is generally believed that the reduction in deforestation within the policy area using a high (30m) resolution; and (ii) deter rates has been driven by a series of environmental policies that (sistema de detecção de desmatamento em tempo real in portuguese), encouraged both forest preservation and the enforcement of existing which is a system that supports the supervision and control of defores­ regulations (assunção et al., 2020; celentano et al., 2017; lovejoy & tation and forest degradation within the environmental policy area of nobre, 2018; nepstad et al., 2014; rajão et al., 2021; richards, 2015; the legal amazon throughout the year but at a more moderate (250m) richards & vanwey, 2015). resolution."

3,"for example, butler and inspection and control of deforestation and degradation in the brazilian moser (2007) showed that estimates of deforestation and studies that legal amazon and part of the action plan for the prevention and control use deforestation data from satellite images could potentially be biased of deforestation in the legal amazon (ppcdam) (west & fearnside, without the proper corrections for cloud cover."

3,"likewise, dupuis et al. plan (near real-time deforestation detection) may be divided into (2020) discusses how new satellite technologies can help with moni­ three phases based on the resolution sensors deployed over time."

3,"the corollary is that, although in principle previous in specific areas of the legal amazon, allowing for the detection of alerts acts of deforestation can be legally punished, it is difficult to implement larger than 1 ha."

4,"the line was initially established to allow the brazilian government to plan the economic growth of the region, which includes the maranhão state’s tropical forest region."
4,the strategy was intended to guarantee the occupancy of the land to the left of the line in order to expand the amazon region’s development potential and contribute to the establishment of a stable and progressive society in the amazon.

4,"with a rainy season that lasts almost nine months, the dry season is limited to the remaining three months of the year, june, july, and august, when there is good satellite visibility across the entire area."
4,"one possible concern with a number of empirical studies on the causes and consequences of deforestation is that it has been shown that for parts of the amazon forest, cloud formation depends on the topog­ raphy of the location (chagnon et al., 2004; heiblum et al., 2014; koren et al., 2004; pinto et al., 2009; wang et al., 2009)."
4,"more precisely, the evapotranspiration characteristics of land cover vegetation are inti­ mately related to the dynamics of the boundary layer and the develop­ ment of clouds that often cap the boundary layer."
4,"as a consequence, compared to heavily wooded regions, deforested areas in the amazon (when replaced with pasture or farmland) are more likely to have greater sensible heat and lower latent heat fluxes."
4,this may increase the boundary layer’s development throughout the day and therefore favour the production of bigger clouds.
4,"in other words, deforested regions promote cloud formation."
4,the difficulty for academics is to determine whether the presence of clouds promotes deforestation or whether prior deforestation facilitates cloud formation.
