2,"argo provides continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar."
2,the successful installation of the argo array and its innovative data management system arose opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and technological innovation.
2,"through the data system, argo provides fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of autonomous profiling floats."
2,"following recent advances in platform and sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years ago to (i) improve argo’s global coverage and value beyond the original design, (ii) extend argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing."
2,"for core argo and each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to global implementation is described."
2,"the objective is to create a fully global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary argo program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in situ elements of the global ocean observing system (legler et al., 2015)."
2,"the integrated system will deliver operational reanalysis and forecasting capability, and assessment of the state and variability of the climate system with respect to physical, biogeochemical, and ecosystems parameters."
2,"it will enable basic research of unprecedented breadth and magnitude, and a wealth of ocean-education and outreach opportunities."
2,"keywords: argo, floats, global, ocean, warming, circulation, temperature, salinity introduction argo information center (aic), following intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) guidelines to protect the the argo program is a major component of both the global rights of coastal states, has enabled global coverage."
2,"presently ocean observing system (goos) and the global climate the number of functioning argo floats remains steady, with total observing system (gcos), providing near-real time data for float count around 4000."
2,"this has been possible, despite relatively ocean and atmospheric services and high quality data for climate flat funding, through a collaboration of international partners research."
2,the argo program began its implementation in 1999 and significant technological innovation.
2,the argo data system and has provided global coverage of the upper 2000 m of provides real-time data within 24 h of collection through the the oceans since 2006.
2,"by november 2018, argo had provided global telecommunications system (gts) and via the internet 2,000,000 profiles since the program began, and a comparable for use at global prediction centers."
2,the argo data management number of velocity drift estimates at 1000 m depth.
2,"although team (admt) also oversees delayed-mode quality control of the originally designed to provide temperature and salinity profiles data and the availability of argo data at the argo global data in the upper 2 km of the ice-free oceans, the array has been assembly centers. expanded into seasonal ice zones using floats equipped with ice to meet future needs, argo should (1) support continuing avoidance algorithms."
2,"argo profiling floats also are sampling innovation in float technology, (2) enhance coverage in critical in many marginal seas."
2,"in addition, ongoing regional pilot regions such as the equatorial band, where higher temporal programs have demonstrated that argo floats can now (1) resolution is needed and the western boundary regions where measure biogeochemical parameters to address oceanic uptake mesoscale ‘noise’ is high, (3) implement deep argo and of carbon, acidification and deoxygenation (biogeochemical, biogeochemical argo in the global array, (4) assess the technical bgc, argo) and (2) make measurements throughout the water readiness and scientific value of experimental measurements for column to 6000 m depth (deep argo)."

3,"this review lays out the motivation, technology advances have continued throughout argo’s 20- development, and present status of the argo program, and year history."
3,"new generation profiling floats are smaller, lighter, addresses the five issues mentioned above."
3,it is important to note and more energy efficient.
3,a profoundly important transition that core argo has reached and maintained full implementation from unidirectional to faster bidirectional communication through innovation and broad community support.

3,"it is important for argo to meet its ice-avoidance measures in float controllers (klatt et al., 2007) future challenges as a single integrated program."
3,"the present have extended the range of argo through the seasonal ice zones elements of argo – core, deep, and bgc – and of its data (wong and riser, 2011)."
3,"improved ctd sensors, as well as management system are not separable, and any other future procedures for delayed-mode quality control (owens and wong, enhancements will similarly be considered as contributions to 2009) have increased the accuracy and consistency of the argo the unified effort. dataset."
3,"float lifetimes have increased, to 4–5 years for most argo national programs, reducing the cost per profile while extending reseeding intervals."
3,"all of these improvements are propagated motivation, development, across the argo national programs through communication of technology best practices (pearlman et al., 2019)."
3,argo’s systematic and regular observation of the global core argo subsurface ocean has transformed ocean observing.
3,"northern during the 1990s, the world ocean circulation experiment hemisphere, near-coastal, and seasonal sampling biases of earlier brought increased understanding of important oceanic roles eras are removed."
3,"the global argo array has been sustained in climate variability and change (siedler et al., 2001)."
3,"the and improved for more than a decade, providing data for need to observe the global subsurface ocean, together with over 3000 research publications and becoming a mainstay a fit-for-purpose revolutionary autonomous technology (davis of global ocean data assimilation, modeling, and prediction et al., 2001), led to a multinational proposal for a global applications."
3,"the notable convergence, in the argo era, of subsurface ocean observing system (argo steering team, 1998). diverse estimates of historical global ocean heat content changes the proposed ‘argo program’ would be comprised of over 3000 (e.g., johnson et al., 2016) has increased the confidence that profiling floats, obtaining a snapshot of the physical state of can be placed on the reliability of national and international the ocean from 0 to 2000 m every 10 days."
3,all data would be assessments of climate change.

3,"the underpinning the success of these efforts was highlighted at the autonomous profiling float technology is simple, robust, and cost-effective."
3,"platforms and sensors meeting (rudnick and perry, 2003), which a strong international consensus on the high value of argo, was the founding meeting for this community."
3,"it was followed by agencies and the science community, contributed to argo’s by the development of a global vision for biogeochemical rapid roll-out."
3,"once argo was in place, a broad base of data acquisition through the inclusion of oxygen sensors on applications (see section “core argo” under the section “end argo platforms (gruber et al., 2007), and the launch the user engagement”) including basic research, assessment of the same year of a working group of the international ocean- state of the earth’s climate, tertiary and secondary education, and color coordinating group, “bio-optical sensors on argo floats” ocean modeling for reanalysis and operational prediction, drew (ioccg, 2011)."
3,"in the meantime, both the oxygen and optical strong community support."
3,"effective partnerships developed communities were promoting their vision for developing a global between argo teams and commercial suppliers, to exploit and network of profiling floats carrying oxygen and optical sensors improve float and sensor technologies."

7,on the future of argo and technical developments.
7,microstructure measurements are not presently part of argo but are presented as an example of how new experimental measurements on profiling floats can progress toward inclusion in the global array.
7,"this process, begins with limited deployment outside of argo to demonstrate value and capabilities."
7,"turbulent mixing in the ocean is important because (1) it contributes to the transport and distributions of heat, freshwater, dissolved gasses, and pollutants, (2) it impacts biological processes by determining the flow field for the smallest plankton and setting large-scale gradients of nutrient availability, and (3) societally-valuable predictions from numerical models of quantities such as temperature and sea level depend sensitively on the geography of ocean mixing rates."
7,"despite its importance, observations of ocean turbulence are extremely sparse, particularly in the deep ocean."
7,"imprints of turbulent transport processes on the large scale ocean state, as readily observed by core argo, allow for inversion of diffusivity maps but direct mixing measurements are needed to further constrain inverse estimates (forget et al., 2015)."

22,"finally, full-depth monitoring of ocean heat content will allow for synthesis with satellite observations for argo’s continuous, real-time, global coverage of p/t/s in the better closure of the global sea level rise and energy budgets. upper 2000 m of the ocean has revolutionized our ability to the argo2020 design (figure 10 and table 1) describes the monitor, understand, and forecast ocean variability."
22,"starting in next-generation argo program that includes enhancements to the late 1990s, the oceanographic community recognized the core argo as well as bgc-argo and deep argo elements, all need and opportunity for a major enhancement of subsurface fully integrated in their spatial distributions and through the measurements to complement recent advances in remote sensing comprehensive argo data management system. and to better monitor the global oceans for climate variability and in the face of increasing anthropogenic forcing and change."
22,"the community designed and implemented argo as an accelerating global and regional trends in sea level, heat autonomous profiling float array capable of sampling the interior content, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, there is urgent global ocean in a temporally and spatially continuous way that need to continuously monitor the physical and biogeochemical revolutionized the existing goos (argo steering team, 1998). variability of the global ocean with sufficient spatial and temporal argo has been a tremendous success in terms of engineering resolution."
22,"the argo in situ profiling array is a crucial piece of advancements, data management, and data dissemination, goos, and essential for meeting this challenge."
22,"here, we have accomplishing its initial goal of monitoring global change and outlined a practical and scientifically compelling plan to expand its consequences, improving ocean forecasts, and providing argo into a global full-depth physical and biogeochemical data underpinning many scientific advances."
22,"by combining the observational array. successful groundwork of core argo with recent float and sensor technology developments, there is now the opportunity to expand argo as a next-generation observational array with author contributions enhanced societal value."
