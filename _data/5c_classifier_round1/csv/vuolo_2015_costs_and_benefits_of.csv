1,we use earth observation (eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (et) and webgis technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers.
1,the study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments.
1,the calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers.
1,"in most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops."
1,at the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types.

2,water resource management is a real and improved efficiency of water application and management is tangible issue in this region.
2,"due to the shortage of precipitation expected to result in a major step toward more sustainable water and the semi-arid regional climate, after the second world war usage (wef, 2013). farmers began to intensify crop production by irrigation with the potential of earth observation (eo) techniques to support groundwater."

3,the information is then transferred to farmers for irrigation management using webgis and mobile phone technologies.
3,the most critical point in the data processing chain is the successful acquisition of cloud-free satellite images.
3,"a first estimation of the availability of adequate data over our pilot area was carried out using the revisit time map created for the sentinel-2 mission planning (martimort et al., 2007)."
3,"according to this map, the constellation of the two sentinel-2 satellites (the first satellite was successfully launched in june 2015) would be able to acquire cloud-free images in summer every 5 days in areas with clear-sky conditions (as in southern europe) and every 15– 30 days in cloudy areas."
3,"for our geographic location, cloud-free images would be available approximately every 10–15 days (with two satellites in operation)."
3,"sentinel-2 data will be available with global coverage as well as free and open access for the european and international users, therefore there will be a high potential for application in europe and in other regions."
3,"moreover, the combined use of sentinel-2 and landsat-8 will further increase the opportunities to acquire cloud-free scenes with adequate temporal resolution."
3,"waiting for a fully operational sentinel-2 mission, our development and initial operations activities have been based on existing free and commercial satellite sensor data."

3,"the black dots indicate the location of the two weather stations. two landsat orbits (figure 1); within this area, landsat achieves a revisit time of 8 days, which is usually not sufficient to produce cloud-free scenes with the required temporal interval. precipitations of less than 550 mm (about 250–300 mm from may therefore, our approach was to use the commercial satellite to september)."
3,"the soil conditions are characterized by a high deimos-1 (featuring an image swath of 630 km and a ground spatial variability, including soils with low to moderate water- sampling distance of 22 m)5 in a virtual constellation of satellites storage capacity (rischbeck, 2007; thaler and eitzinger, 2008; with landsat-8."

7,the most often mentioned and terminology were difficult to understand.
7,"some farmers reason for taking part in the demonstration and evaluation noted that the system is not compatible with their management activities was (i) the determination of the best time for irrigation, structure as they need a period of a few days to irrigate one (ii) the interest in new technologies, and (iii) the information field and therefore cannot react immediately on changing water about crop evapotranspiration."
7,another incentive was the requirements of the crops.

7,"sometimes, satellite images with a higher vigor maps, farmers expected to prove their long professional spatial resolution were expected. experience and to save money on energy costs for irrigation, on concerning the decision making process for irrigation, results travels and time necessary to survey all their parcels."
7,expected indicate that farmers base their decisions on various criteria: benefits that were mentioned less often included the possibility: the most frequently listed factors were the actual weather conditions and the weather forecast.
7,farmers use various online platforms to get information about precipitation and wind direction.
7,"in addition, many farmers have their own precipitation measurement stations within the farm or in field."
7,"another environmental criterion is the actual condition of the plants, which is checked personally on site."
7,economic criteria also play an important role in the decision to irrigate crops.
7,"the price of the seeds determines the initial investment and crops with expensive seeds (e.g., onions) are more frequently irrigated (resulting often in over-irrigation)."
7,the expected market price of the product is another factor to decide which crops are irrigated.
7,irrigation itself is expensive with prices between 0.2–0.5 e per cubic meter depending on the type of irrigation system.
7,fuel prices are subject to high variations and are therefore also a relevant factor in the decision-making process.
7,"to give a practical example, we can consider that 1 hectare (ha) of onion receives about 200 mm of water, which is figure 5 | crop water requirements (cwr) vs. supplied irrigation equivalent to 2000 cubic meters per ha."
7,"this leads to a total cost volumes for sugarbeet (number of irrigation units, n = 16), soya of 400–1000 e per ha only for irrigation."
7,"in addition, farmers (n = 5), potatoes (n = 8), onion (n = 3), maize (n = 9), and other crops have obligations to fulfill production contracts, which is only (carrots, spinach and peas) (n = 5). possible with irrigation."

9,"therefore, we expect even a larger net economic benefit for society than the one estimated here."
9,"social and environmental costs express the value of water allocation to alternative users (e.g., opportunity costs associated with urban and industrial water use) and the impact on water resources, pollution, soil degradation, and landscape modifications due to intense irrigated agriculture, while our financial analysis is based only on the on-farm costs that farmers generally pay for water as well as for any other production costs, such as seed, machinery, labor, and maintenance."
9,the literature indicates that these two categories of costs (social and environmental) are far from being negligible.

9,"conclusions the adoption of better irrigation practices requires information upcoming sentinel-2 missions (10–20 m pixel size), we foresee technologies and tools that can be easily embedded into existing minimum need for commercial data, therefore the cost will be systems and that can fully respond to the user needs."
9,"research notably reduced. and demonstration activities (this project and other case studies using commercial satellite data at 10–30 m pixels size, the such as demeter, pleiades, and sirius-gmes eu projects), service cost ranges between 65,000 and 68,000 e per growing show that satellite-based irrigation advisory services can be season."
9,"the cost of the satellite data would comprise about 25% successfully implemented in different environments and, once in of the total cost of the service."

9,"the combination of satellite-based mapping 10–30 m spatial resolution), we foresee an average service cost tools and webgis/smartphone devices provides the basis for of about 50,000 e per growing season."
9,this cost will be further better and more informed decision over a variety of spatial and reduced with the automation of various processing steps as for temporal scales.
9,"the final decision is then taken knowing local instance atmospheric correction (vuolo et al., 2015b). system components and management constraints."
9,"this implies a using the four data cost scenarios and the extent of the region strong commitment by users and is contingent on the assumption of interest (marchfeld), we calculated the total cost of the service that irrigation will be managed to achieve a specific target, for for an entire growing season."
9,"a summary graph is provided example maximum water use efficiency, yield, or profitability. in figure 7."
9,"taking into account only the 20,000 ha that are this assumption seems valid in many intensive irrigated areas regularly irrigated in the region of marchfeld (neugebauer and since farmers are interested in reducing operating constraints and vuolo, 2014) and depending on the type of satellite data used, the costs, maximize or stabilize yield and, at the same time, maintain service would have an estimated cost ranging between 2.5 and 4.3 sustainability and environmental efficiency. e/ha per year."
9,"instead, considering the total area of the marchfeld our work contributed to evaluate the implementation and region (40,000 ha) and the use of free data (possible with landsat- functioning process of a satellite-based irrigation advisory service 8 and sentinel-2 in operation), the service would have a cost of in a very different environment compared to precursors systems approximately 1.3 e/ha per year."
9,"in the first case, the cost of the running already in mediterranean countries (e.g., irrimet6 ), in service would be equal or below the willingness to pay expressed australia (e.g., irrieye7 ) or in california (tops8 )."
9,we calibrated by most of the users (3 to 5 e/ha per year).
9,"in the second case, the and validated the models to derive crop biophysical variables cost of the service would be substantially below the willingness to using ground measurements (vuolo et al., 2013), performed pay, which allows for revenue generation. the demonstration and evaluation with a group of farmers and in comparison: irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 completed the adaptation of mapping and data dissemination e/ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters technologies; finally, we assessed the benefits and costs of the per ha."
9,"with a correct irrigation application, more than 10% of service."
9,"an estimation of the net economic benefit was also the water and energy could be saved in water-intensive crops, obtained and presented in this study."
9,results confirm that the which is equivalent to an economic benefit of 40–100 e/ha per adoption of new space-based solutions for crop and irrigation year. water management is a complex process and favorable conditions it is worth noting that the benefit analysis only includes the farmer’s perspective and does not consider the benefit derived 6 www.irrimet.eu/ from more efficient use of environment and water resources.

10,"therefore, our approach has been based technical resources, which are often limited. on establishing a local network and on intensive work with the in the marchfeld, the latter irrigation approach is more users since the very beginning."
10,this way of implementing has prevalent.

10,"the decision feedback from final users is essential to improve the whether to irrigate or not, when and how much, is a critical issue effectiveness of the service in terms of water use optimization, for farmers and it is often based only on personal experience. especially during the early stage of service implementation."
10,"monitoring the daily soil water balance is the first steps toward in our opinion, a continuous effort will still be necessary to the implementation of these irrigation strategies."
10,"the approach transfer, tune, and demonstrate these technologies in different necessitates the development of operative frameworks to run environments and to adapt them to new challenges with the a soil water balance model at parcel level and to collect in participation of the final users."
