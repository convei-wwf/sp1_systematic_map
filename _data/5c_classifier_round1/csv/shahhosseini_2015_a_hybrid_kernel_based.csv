1,thenkabail received: 31 may 2015 / accepted: 17 september 2015 / published: 30 september 2015 abstract: detection of damages caused by natural disasters is a delicate and difficult task due to the time constraints imposed by emergency situations.
1,"therefore, an automatic change detection (cd) algorithm, with less user interaction, is always very interesting and helpful."
1,"so far, there is no existing cd approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) multi-temporal images being corrupted by either noise or non-normalized radiometric differences; (c) difference images having overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other."
1,"also, a low degree of automation is not optimal for real-time cd applications and also one-dimensional representations of classical cd methods hide the useful information in multi-temporal images."
1,"in order to resolve these problems, two automatic kernel-based cd algorithms (kcd) were proposed based on kernel clustering and support vector data description (svdd) algorithms in high dimensional hilbert space."
1,"in this paper (a) a new similarity space was proposed in order to increase the separation between change and no-change classes, and also to decrease the processing time, (b) three kernel-based approaches were proposed for transferring the multi-temporal images from spectral space into high dimensional hilbert space, (c) automatic approach was proposed to extract the precise labeled samples; (d) kernel parameter w a s selected automatically by optimizing an improved cost function and (e) initial value of the kernel parameter was estimated by a statistical method based on the l2-norm distance."

2,remote sens.
2,"2015, 7 12830 quickbird and landsat tm/etm+ imageries were used for the accuracy of analysis of proposed methods."
2,"the comparative analysis showed the accuracy improvements of kernel clustering based cd and svdd based cd methods with respect to the conventional cd techniques such as minimum noise fraction, independent component analysis, spectral angle mapper, simple image differencing and image rationing, and also the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of the proposed cd method in similarity space decreases the processing runtime."

2,introduction the analysis of multi-temporal earth observations is essential for change detection (cd) applications [1].
2,"this process is for identifying the differences in spatial, spectral, and radiometric states of phenomenon by observing it at different times [2]."
2,"cd is a useful technique for various applications such as land-cover/land-use change analysis, assessment of deforestation, damage assessment, disaster monitoring, and other environmental changes [1]."
2,"for this purpose, several cd methods have been developed for analyzing and detecting the changed areas from multi-temporal images [3,4]."
2,it has been generally agreed that change detection is a complicated and integrated process.
2,"so far, there is no existing approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) existence of different environmental factors such as atmospheric and light conditions in multi-temporal images; (c) multi-temporal images corrupted by either noise or radiometric differences that cannot be normalized and (d) difference images have overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other."
2,"furthermore, for the time being, the degree of automation is far too low for real-time cd applications."
2,hence this paper aims to resolve the issues mentioned above.
2,change detection methods are divided into six categories in the literature: (a) images algebra (b) change vector analysis (cva); (c) image transformation; (d) post-classification comparison (e) direct classification; and (f) hybrid cd [5–7].
2,"in images algebra method, mathematical operations such as subtraction or division applied to multi-temporal imagery; providing the difference or ratio images [8,9]."
2,"in cva approach by computing the difference vectors between multi-temporal images, providing both the magnitude and direction of the change [10,11]."
2,in both images algebra and cva change detection methods digital values of difference pixels or magnitude pixels are numerically compared with a pre-defined threshold to generate the change map.
2,"these two methods are non-automatic and ineffective, because determining the appropriate threshold becomes a difficult and time-consuming task and can fail in real time applications such as disaster management [12,13]."
2,"however, image transformation methods are based on mathematical transformation to highlight the variance between images and provide a well-designed approach to handle high dimensional data."
2,there is no defined thematic meaning the output of this method and changed area may be difficult to locate and interpret [14].
2,post-classification comparison technique is based on the comparison of multiple classification maps to detect the class transitions between multi-temporal images [15].
2,"in direct classification method,"
3,"remote sens. 2015, 7 12831 multi-temporal images are stacked together and then classified directly in order to detect the land cover transition [16]."
3,"in both classification based methods, labeled samples are essential for training the supervised classifiers."
3,"nevertheless, preparing of samples for training the classifiers can be a difficult task, especially for a time series of images."
3,"all classifiers are, in general, sensitive to the noise of pixels in multi-temporal images."
3,"on the other hand, multi-temporal classification methods are based on linear representations, and do not consider the non-linear cross-information among the pixels in different time [17,18]."
3,"as a result, the classifier trained with samples coming from different distributions due to differences in atmospheric and light conditions."
3,"so, classification errors in each of the input maps are directly transformed to the generated change map."
3,"therefore, they can be inefficient for images corrupted by either noise or radiometric differences that cannot be normalized or, in the case of multi-temporal images, which have spectrally overlapped classes [1,19,20]."
3,"to address these problems, several strategies have been presented and the approaches considered knowledgeable threshold-based image differencing or ratioing."
3,bruzzone and prieto [21] propose two unsupervised cd techniques based on the bayes theorem.
3,the first method is based on an automatic threshold selection that minimizes the overall change detection error probability.
3,the second method analyzes the difference image by considering the spatial-contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel.
3,the accuracy of the analysis of proposed methods was carried out on two different data sets including landsat 5 tm sensor and the synthetic data.
3,the experimental results certified the effectiveness of both proposed methods.
3,molina et al. [22] suggested a multisource cd approach for multi resolution data sets.
3,"after extraction of various change indices, different thresholding algorithms were applied to these indices."
3,"the indices are then integrated into a change detection multisource fusion procedure, for generating a final cd map."
3,this method has been applied to airborne and spaceborne optical imageries with different spectral and spatial resolutions.
3,the proposed cd algorithm has proven to be efficient with respect to using various spatial resolutions of sensors.
3,"in some studies, the methods based on a similarity measure extraction and determining a proper threshold are used for automatic change detection."
3,inglada and mercier [23] presented a new similarity measure for automatic change detection in multi-temporal sar images.
3,tests on the simulated and real data showed that this detector performs better than all the other methods.
3,mercier et al. [24] showed how to obtain a binary change map from the similarity measures of the local statistics of images before and after a disaster.
3,the decision process is achieved by the use of a support vector machines (svm) approach in which a stochastic kernel has been defined.
3,the results have shown the efficiency of the methods since it yields an appropriate binary change map for multi-sensor change detection.
3,"however, this was demonstrated to be inefficient based on the reasons stated earlier in the case real-time cd problems."
3,"on the other hand, change detection can be viewed as a particular case of the multi-temporal image classification problem."
3,pajares [25] proposed an automatic method based on the hopfield neural network (hnn) for image change detection.
3,each pixel in the difference image is a node in the hnn.
3,"this method, unlike classical methods [21,26], uses the performance of contextual and self-data information by integrating the data and contextual information under the form of an energy function."
3,the self-data information minimizes the errors derived from incorrect decisions taken by the neighbors of a pixel.
3,the experimental results showed that the proposed method has proven to be robust against noise as compared with the classical methods.
3,"nevertheless, the main disadvantage of the hnn method"
4,"remote sens. 2015, 7 12832 originates from its high time consuming process."
4,"this approach, however, inherits all the aforementioned problems of the classification-based cd scenario."
4,it is only recently that authors have turned to kernel-based cd methods for change detection applications [12].
4,guorui et al. [27] proposed a distance-based kernel change detection algorithm (dkcd).
4,the multi-temporal images are mapped into a feature space via nonlinear mapping.
4,"then, a simple distance measure between two feature vectors defined in feature space."
4,their results proved a reliable performance with respect to the speed and accuracy of change detection mapping.
4,camps-valls et al. [28] present a kernel-based method based on support vector domain description (svdd) classifier for change detection of remote sensing images.
4,good performance of the proposed method illustrates the generality of the algorithms.
4,volpi et al. [17] have presented an unsupervised clustering method based on an svm classifier to find the changes in multi-temporal co-registered images.
4,two change detection schemes were adapted for very high resolution optical imagery (vhr): multi-date classification and difference image analysis.
4,experiments on vhr images proved the reliability of the proposed approach.
4,in kernel-based methodologies kernel-based discrimination amongst the classes of interest can be enhanced by using the nonlinear decision function and better results will be achieved.
4,"these types of decision functions are locally linear, but in general have a complex shape that is not equivalent to a line in 2d or a hyperplane in higher dimensions [29]."
4,the main idea of kernel methods is based on the fact that the nonlinear decision function can be obtained by running a linear algorithm in a higher dimensional reproducing kernel hilbert space (rkhs).
4,"in classification of multi-temporal remotely-sensed data, a linear decision function is clearly not sophisticated."
4,the traditional classification approaches solve these problems by using more sophisticated distributions in modelling the optimal bayes classifier.
4,"but, these methods are computationally more expensive."
4,an efficient method in this field is the kernel concept which was originally applied in support vector machines technique.
4,the linear decision function in the kernel space corresponds to a forceful nonlinear decision function in the spectral space [12].
4,the mapping to that space is implicitly defined by kernel functions replacing dot products in the original formulation in spectral space [2].
4,"in the change detection problem, these kernel methods allow modeling the nonlinear nature of the change [30]."
4,"however, none of these methods considers the cross relations between multi-temporal images in the classifier."
4,"also, these non-automatic kernel-based methods require labeled samples for training a classifier, and as a result, they are still inefficient in real-time cd applications."
4,"in hybrid cd method, multiple comparison methods within a framework were used."
4,"the most commonly used strategy is a combination of images algebra and direct classification methods for the detection and classifying the changes [31,32]."
4,this strategy was used in this paper for developing the proposed cd method.
4,"due to attending to the previously identified problems, in this paper, a hybrid kernel-based change detection method was proposed in a similarity space which has demonstrated good results in image change detection problems with few labeled training samples in high dimensional spaces."
4,this proposed method used all single and cross information between the multi-temporal images bands and presents a nonlinear solution in hilbert space for the change detection problem.
4,"this leads to a strong decrease in the false alarm rate (classifying a background pixel as a change class), and a slight accuracy improvement in the generated change map."
4,"meanwhile, the initialization of proposed algorithm was addressed automatically by finding a threshold on change vector magnitude distribution."
5,remote sens.
5,"2015, 7 12833 in parallel with the proposed kernel-based cd algorithm, an svdd-based change detection method was presented and analyzed."
5,"these methods were applied on landsat tm/etm+ and quickbird multi-spectral imageries for mapping and estimating the deforestation and damaged areas caused by human activity and natural disasters, respectively."
5,this proposed kernel-based cd method uses three approaches for mapping the data from the spectral space into higher dimensional hilbert space.
5,"the first is based on the difference image in the spectral space, which is named as dfss (differential in spectral space)."
5,"in the second approach, to provide the most discriminative information, a mapping function is developed to compute the difference image in hilbert space, i.e., differential in hilbert space (dfhs)."
5,"finally, in the third approach, multi-temporal images are stacked together in spectral space and then transformed into hilbert space, namely as heaped in spectral space (heap-spc)."
5,"in hilbert space, the complicated and nonlinear relationship between the data could be modeled linearly."
5,"by using a similarity space, the separation between change and no-change classes increased and time of the process decreased."
5,"in a particular case, the multi-temporal data are transformed into a spectral distance-angle-correlation-spectral value (sdacv) space [33]."
5,"in order to determine the threshold and extract the precise training samples, a method based on integration of a change vector analysis (cva) technique and kernel-based k-means clustering algorithm was proposed."
5,"on the other hand, proper kernel parameters of the proposed kernel-based methods were determined by using a developed cost function based on geometric and spectral similarity criteria."
5,this precise training set was used for training the kernel-based minimum distance (kmd) and the support vector data description (svdd) classifiers.
5,methodology 2.1.
5,"proposed framework proposed kernel-based cd framework refers to several proposed stages, including: (a) pre-processing step; (b) similarity space and hilbert space transformations; (c) pseudo training samples extraction; (d) parameter estimation of kernel-based cd methods; (e) kernel-based cd method and (f) svdd based cd method."
5,the flowchart of proposed method for automatic detection of changes is presented in figure 1.
5,"as it can be seen, our focus in this paper illustrated as highlighted stages in block diagram."
5,"in the first step of implementation, the geometric and the radiometric preprocessing are performed on the multi-temporal images."
5,then the multi-temporal images are co-registered manually to each other.
5,cloudiness of the study area in the quickbird dataset is symmetrically masked.
5,"in the second step, the multi-temporal images are transformed into a similarity space."
5,"to this end, a reference vector is needed to measure the similarity of all the pixels in the multi-temporal images."
5,"since the objective of proposed algorithm is mapping the changes, the reference vector of change class was used."
5,"after extracting the precise training data, the mean of precise changed training samples was calculated in order to achieve the reference change vector."
5,"then, using the equations (13)–(16) and the reference vector from the previous step, all pixels of the image are transformed into the similarity space."
5,"in this paper, the multi-spectral data are transformed to similarity spaces using spectral distance-angle-correlation-spectral value (sdacv) features [34]."

6,"2015, 7 12834 figure 1."
6,block diagram of proposed hybrid kernel-based change detection algorithm.
6,"in the next step, for transferring the multi-temporal images into hilbert space, three approaches between the corresponding bands were performed in hilbert space."
6,"the first approach accounts for the difference image in the similarity space, which is named as dfss-sim (differential in similarity space)."
7,remote sens.
7,"2015, 7 12835 in this method, the multi-temporal images are first transferred into similarity space and then subtracted in a pixel-by-pixel method to obtain the difference image, i.e., d   d ."
7,"the difference pixels are then mapped to the hilbert space as φ(x) = φ(xd), resulting in the kernel function k(xid, xjd) = φ(xid), φ(xjd)."
7,"in the second approach, to provide the most discriminative information, a mapping function is developed to compute the difference image in hilbert space which is named dfhs."
7,"for a given pixel, the rkhs feature map φ(.) corresponding to the difference pixel can be defined as:     φ  x i   η  t  φ x i t   η  t  φ x i t  ."
7,"expanding the dot product and exploiting mercer’s conditions, the 2 2 1 1 corresponding kernel function is obtained [12,35]:        k  x i , x j   φ  x i  , φ  x j   k x i t 2  , x j t 2   k x i t1  , x j t1   k x i t 2  , x j t1   k x i t1  , x j t 2   (1) in the third approach, before and after images are stacked together before and after in spectral space and then transformed into hilbert space, which is named as heap-spc."
7,the main issue of the automatic change detection algorithms is to find a proper initialization allowing the method to converge to a global minimum.
7,"for this reason, in the next step, by analyzing the components of a change vector and setting an appropriate threshold, pseudo training samples are created for the change and no-change classes."
7,these sample data are being used for determining the imprecise initial set of kernel k-means clustering parameters and training the svdd-based change detection method [17].
7,"then, the precise training samples and kernel k-means parameters are automatically estimated by optimizing a cost function with the nature of geometrical and spectral similarity in kernel space."
7,these samples are used as training data for training of kmd classifiers.
7,"after the training stage of kmd classifier and svdd-based change detection method and optimization of its parameters, each pixel entered into a proposed methods and the class of each pixel is determined."
7,the output of this step is the change map.
7,"in dfhs approach, the difference kernel needs the estimation of the corresponding kernel parameters, e.g., two bandwidths when using two rbf kernels corresponding to two kernels in equation (17)."
7,"in this paper, a search among two parameters θ = {σsingle, σcross} with respect to k  x i t , x j t  and k  x i t , x j t  is i i i j performed [35]."
7,"to solve this problem, a new method to estimate the initial value of the rbf kernel parameter in the change detection problem was employed."
7,this method is based on a statistical technique and uses the l2 distance norm.
7,"in this new method, in the first step, two sets of spectral vectors within the first image are elected randomly."
7,"in the next step, euclidean distance between two spectral vectors in the first image is computed and the median of this distance is selected [33]."
7,the same process is performed for the second image.
7,"finally, the average of the two distances, obtained from multi-temporal images, is considered as the initial estimation of rbf kernel parameter."
7,"in the next step, a change interval is considered with respect to the initial value, so that this value is in the center of a change interval."
7,"these ranges can be used in the grid search method to select the precise rbf kernel parameter [33,36]."
7,this new method leads to a faster convergence of grid-searching technique for selecting the global optimum rbf kernel parameter.
7,"thresholding scheme the main issue of proposed kernel-based cd algorithms is to find a proper threshold allowing the method to extract two pseudo training samples with high probability rate, belonging to change and no-change classes."
7,"in order to estimate the change and no-change class distributions, the magnitude of spectral"
8,"remote sens. 2015, 7 12836 change vector was calculated."
8,this distribution can be seen as a mixture of two gaussian models regarding change and no-change pixels.
8,"in the next step, by analyzing the magnitude of a change vector and setting an appropriate threshold, the pseudo training samples were created for change and no-change classes [17]."
8,"in this paper, the proper threshold was determined by fitting a gaussian function to change the vector magnitude’s distribution of multi-temporal images."
8,the mean and variance values of gaussian function were estimated and used as a threshold.
8,the extracted pseudo training samples were then used for determining the imprecise initial set of kernel clustering algorithm parameters such as cluster center.
8,kernel k-means clustering the kernel k-means clustering algorithm (kkmc) rewriting the linear k-means in rkhs (reproducing kernel hilbert space) by means of mapping functions φ(.).
8,"the mapping to that space is implicitly defined by the kernel functions replacing the dot products in the original formulation, which only needs input samples in their spectral space."
8,"since the k-means formulation can be expressed solely in the terms of dot products, kernel functions can replace these expressions."
8,this helps the value of the dot product to return directly to the rkhs [35].
8,"let x = {a1, a2, a3, ..., an} be the set of data points and “c” the number of clusters."
8,in the first step “c” cluster centers are randomly initialized.
8,"the kernel k-means algorithm is formulated as the minimization of the sum of the squares of distances between mapped samples and their mean: k d  φ  x  ,μ    φ  x i   μ q 2  (2) q 1 iπ q where μq denotes the mean of the cluster q and   x    q is the mapped samples in the rkhs."
8,"by replacing  q  nq1  j   x j  and applying the kernel substitution, equation (2) becomes: q 2 1 d φ  x  , μ   k  xi , xi    k xi , x j   2  k x j, xl  (3) n q j π q n q j,lπ q where nq is the number of samples is assigned to the cluster q."
8,"the position of cluster centers, are approximated by considering the closest samples to the center xc  arg min xi d    xi  ,  q  ."
8,"after determining the clustering parameters, each data point assign to that cluster center whose distance is minimum [37]."
8,"support vector data description in parallel with the proposed algorithm, another method based on support vector data description (svdd) was presented and analyzed."
8,"after extracting the pseudo training samples of change and no-change regions, these samples are used to train the svdd classifier."
8,now assuming a dataset xi i1 n belongs to a given class of interest.
8,"the objective here is to find a hyper-sphere in a high dimensional hilbert space of radius r > 0 and center a, with a minimum volume containing most of these data points [28,38] (see figure 2)."
9,remote sens.
9,"2015, 7 12837 figure 2."

9,the hyper-sphere is described by the center a and radius r [39].
9,"2 therefore one has to minimize r2 constrained to ( xi )  a  r 2 , i  1,..., n ."
9,"however, since the training distribution may contain outliers; one introduces a set of slack variables i  0 and the problem then becomes [28]:   min  r2  c  i  (4) r ,a  i  constrained to 2 ( xi )  a  r 2  i , i  0, i  1,..., n (5) where the parameter c controls the trade-off between the volume of the hyper-sphere and the acceptable errors (penalty parameter)."
9,"the dual functional now becomes [28,38]:   max    i ( xi ), ( xi )    i  j ( xi ), ( x j )  (6) i  i i, j  subject again to 0 i  c this constitutes a quadratic programming problem that yields a set of i fulfilling that (i) if ( xi )  a  r 2 then i  0 (ii) if ( xi )  a  r 2 then 0 i  c , and (iii) if 2 2 ( xi )  a  r 2 then i  c as a result, support vectors (sv) are those satisfying i  0 , while 2 samples whose associated i  c are considered outliers."
9,"an equivalent formulation was proposed, in which one places a hyper-plane that separates the data from the origin with maximum margin (figure 2)."
9,"in this case the problem reduces to [28,38]: 1 2 1  min  w    w , ,  2  i   i  i  1,..., n (7)  constrained to ξi ≥ 0 and where ν ∈ (0,1] is a regularization parameter (c) controlling the trade-off between accepting data into the class and having w small."

10,"kernel minimum distance classifier after determining the cluster centers and optimizing the algorithm parameters, accurate training samples of change and no-change classes can be extracted."

11,"improved kernel parameter selection for almost all kernel-based algorithms, the selection of the parameters plays an essential role in the efficiency of algorithm."
11,"in this paper, the kernel k-means clustering the kernel parameters are tuned automatically by optimizing a criterion with the nature of geometrical and similarity in hilbert space."
11,"the geometrical part of this criterion, tries to cluster the multi-temporal image with an optimal geometrical configuration."
11,"to achieve this purpose, the difference between the average cluster distance and the centers in the feature space is minimized and used as a geometrical criterion [17,45]."
11,"moreover,"
12,"remote sens. 2015, 7 12840 the similarity part of the criterion is minimizing the resemblance between the clusters."
12,both of these geometrical and similarity parts of the criterion are combined linearly with c1 and c2 coefficients.
12,these parameters are determined during the optimization process.
12,these developed criterion lead to an optimal selection of kernel parameters.
12,"the set of retained kernel parameters θ°pt is: θopt  arg min c1  g  c2  s (17) 1 k  g   d  φ  x i  ,μ q    d(μ q ,μ l )  (18)  n q 1 iπq πq  πl      2     i πq  φ  x i   μ q  φ  x j   μ l     1  1  j π l     n 1      σqσl    s      (19) 2    d φ  xi  , φ  x j   2   i π q     j π l  in equation (17), g and s are the geometrical and similarity parts of proposed cost function."
12,to estimate this quantity; the kernel k-means is wrapped on the given pseudo-training set by varying c1; c2; θ.
12,"the parameters minimizing the equation (17); are used as optimum kernel parameter in kernel clustering algorithm; by assigning an unknown pixel x’ to the cluster whose centroid satisfies arg min xc d(φ  x ,φ  xc ) ."
12,this can be seen as a nonlinear minimum distance classification [45].
12,a great number of kernel functions exist and it is difficult to explain their individual characteristics.
12,as shown in [46] two kinds of kernels may be defined: (1) local kernels.
12,"in this kernel type, only the data that are close or in the proximity of each others have an influence on the kernel values."
12,"basically, all kernels that are based on a distance function are local kernels."
12,"examples of typical local kernels are: radial basis, kmod, and inverse multi-quadric."
12," radial basis function: k  x, x '  exp g x  x ' 2   1  kmod: k  x, x '  exp  1  1 x  x '  (20)   1 inverse multiquadratic: k  x, x '  exp    2   x  x ' 1  (2) global kernels."
12,"in this kernel type, samples that are far away from each other still have an influence on the kernel value."
12,"all kernels based on the dot-product are global: linear: k  x, x '  x.x ' polynomial:k  x, x '    x.x ' 1 p (20) sigmodi : k  x, x '  tanh  x.x ' 1"

13,"2015, 7 12841 in this paper we used linear, polynomial, rbf, and sigmoid functions as kernels in proposed kernel-based change detection methods."
13,different kernels can be used to accommodate the wide-range of nonlinearities that may occur in the various datasets.
13,"therefore, according to the complexity of the remote sensing datasets, an optimal kernel selection process must be carried out."
13,"typically, this selection process could be done by optimizing a certain cost function related to an issue that must be resolved in remote sensing applications."
13,"as stated earlier, in this paper we used an improved cost function with the nature of geometrical and similarity in hilbert space for extracting the optimum kernel types and kernel parameters."
13,experiments 3.1.
13,"remote sensing data in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we considered two different data sets made up of multi-temporal-multispectral images acquired by the landsat tm/etm+ and quickbird imageries."

14,"2015, 7 12842 in the first dataset, the logging activities in 1990 occurred in prince george area in northern british columbia, canada causing environmental damage in this region."
14,"in order to perform our change detection process and extract the deforestation areas, the landsat imagery are used in two time periods; before and after the logging."
14,"the images have been acquired in 1990 and 1999 by landsat-5 tm and landsat-7 etm+, respectively."
14,this multi-date images have 30 m spatial resolution and seven spectral bands.
14,the true color images of before and after the logging activities are shown in figure 4.
14,"in the second dataset, the 2004 indian ocean earthquake was an undersea mega thrust earthquake that occurred at 00:58:53 utc on sunday, 26 december 2004, with an epicentre off the west coast of sumatra, indonesia [48]."
14,it was one of the deadliest natural disasters recorded in history [14].
14,"to extract the destroyed areas affected by tsunami in coastal area, the quickbird imagery are used in two time periods; before and after the tsunami."
14,the images have been acquired in december 2004 and january 2005 respectively.

15,"2015, 7 12843 one of the main reasons for using these two data sets is that, in both of them, due to the occurrence of natural or planned disaster, a change has been created in the natural environment."
15,"also, the purpose of this paper is to provide an efficient and accurate method to monitor the environmental changes using each type of remotely-sensed data."
15,"experimental results to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, various assessments are carried out: (1) accuracy analysis of heap-spc approach using the proposed kernel-based algorithm in spectral space; (2) a comparative evaluation of two methods for calculating the difference image such as dfss-sim and dfhs-sim approaches in similarity space; (3) sensitivity analysis of proposed kernel-based method with respect to kernels’ types and their parameters; (4) a comparative analysis between the proposed kernel-based change detection method and svdd-based change detection method; (5) evaluation of usefulness of the similarity space versus spectral space for implementing the proposed kernel-based change detection algorithm; and (6) computational cost and accuracy analysis of proposed methods against the conventional change detection methods, namely, the mnf (minimum noise fraction) change detection method, the ica (independent component analysis) based change detection method, sam (spectral angle mapper), image subtraction change detection, and image rationing change detection methods."
15,"in proposed kernel-based change detection algorithm and svdd-based change detection method, the range of kernel parameters is as follows: (1) rbf kernel and sigmoid kernel bandwidth variation ranges are (0.1, 5) with the rate of change 0.1; (2) the degree of polynomial kernel variation range is (0, 5) with the rate of change 1 and (3) single-time and cross-time kernel parameters variation interval used in dfhs approach, are considered (0, 5) with a change rate value of 0.1 at each step."
15,all the change intervals used in the grid search method done by automatic statistical method using l2-norm distance to estimate the optimal parameters for this interval.
15,"to evaluate the proposed algorithm, the test data have been extracted from the images by visually comparing the multi-temporal images."
15,"in quickbird and landsat data sets, the number of test samples for change class was 4959 and 4727 pixels and for no-change class was 3343 and 4575 pixels, respectively."
15,these samples are selected such that they spread over the entire area that the effects of sun angle and topography should be carefully considered in the analysis.
15,two criteria based on kappa coefficient of agreement and overall accuracy (oa) were used for quantitative accuracy analysis of the results.

15,"proposed kernel-based cd method in this section, the proposed kernel-based cd method with two differencing approaches (dfss-sim and dfhs-sim) are implemented and analyzed on quickbird and landsat data sets."
15,"in the first step, all pixels of the images are transferred into the similarity space."
15,"then, difference images were calculated via dfss-sim and dfhs-sim approach."
15,"in the next step, the difference images are used as input to the kernel k-means clustering algorithm."
15,"then, after the selection of optimum parameters, a clustering algorithm is used to extract the precise training set."
15,these samples are used for training the kmd classifier.
15,the kmd classifier is then employed to separate the change and no-change pixels.

22,"in order to compare our results with the respective outputs from other similar researches, the experimental results of kernel-based cd methods were evaluated."
22,"gustavo camps-valls et al. [28,35] proposed two kernel-based cd methods including (1) kernel-based image differencing and image ratioing cd methods and (2) svms based and svdd based multi-temporal image classifiers."
22,synthetic and real remote sensing data sets were used for analyzing the performance of the proposed methodological framework based on kernels.
22,it is worth mentioning that implementation of algorithm and flowchart of this framework are quite different with our proposed approach.
22,several conclusions can be derived from accuracy assessment on synthetic dataset.
22,"in all cases, the rbf kernel outperformed the linear kernel."
22,"in multi-temporal image classification, the best kernel classifier is constituted by the cross-terms kernel because it includes the temporal information of image evolution."
22,"in change detection problems, the best results were obtained by using the difference kernel."
22,svms generally works slightly better than the svdd.
22,"in all cases and scenes, it becomes obvious that the use of the rbf kernel provides much better results than the linear kernel."
22,"svms classifier shows the best results; however, svdd classifier can also produce stable and robust outcomes, which confirms their suitability to application scenarios in which incomplete or partially complete information is available [28,35]."
22,"by comparing our results illustrated in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, it can be concluded that the outcome of these works are in agreement with our main findings."
22,"in optimum kernel type and kernel parameter selection of kernel clustering algorithm, these parameters are tuned automatically by optimizing an improved cost function with the nature of geometrical and spectral similarity in kernel space."
22,this optimization process runs for all kernel types so that the optimized kernel parameter and the corresponding kernel type that minimize the cost function to be determined.
22,the procedure of optimal single-time and cross-time rbf kernel parameters selection corresponding to maximum value and minimum value of cost function in the dfhs-sim-rbf approach is shown in figure 8.
22,"for this purpose, single-time and cross-time parameters of composite kernel defined in equation (17), were calculated using grid searching method in such a way for the value of the cost function to be minimized [33,36]."
22,this result illustrates the joint optimization of σsinger and σcross (dfhs-sim-rbf).
22,the proposed cost function showed detectable and appropriate global minima.
22,as seen in figure 8; the white marks are placed to minimize the proposed cost function and green marks are the location of the maximum value of the proposed cost function for quickbird and landsat data sets.
22,"therefore; the parameters θ  σsingle , σcross  that the cost function to be minimized for them can be selected."
22,by analyzing the results it can be concluded that for both data sets; for low bandwidth values; the change and no-change clusters are not separable and the spectral similarity of clusters is overestimated.
22,for wider bandwidths; the similarity value between change and no-change clusters is underestimated.
22,the optimal separability between clusters is reached when the cross kernel parameters is in the range of the average euclidean distance and average similarity value among pixels within clusters.

24,"2015, 7 12852 these results are presented in table 4 which show that for both landsat and quickbird data sets, all proposed kernel-based methods such as dfss-sim-rbf, dfhs-sim-rbf, heap-spc-rbf approaches and svdd-based cd method have higher accuracy than all well-known cd methods."
24,the classical change detection methods show intermediate level accuracies caused by both the false alarm rate and the weak detection rate when compared to the proposed kernel-based algorithm.
24,"since, spectral difference values for change and no-change classes in the differential image obtained in the spectral space are close to each other, the boundary separation between change and no-change classes is not readily detected."
24,"through transferring this difference image into the hilbert space with a higher dimension, the separation of these two classes is increased and better results will be achieved."
24,this classical method is extremely sensitive to the noise of data and error of multi-temporal data misregistration.
24,the accuracy of the produced change map is greatly dependent on the selection of appropriate threshold.
24,"two scenarios were considered in order to compare the computational cost of the proposed kernel-based cd methods, against the computational cost of classical algorithms."
24,the computational runtime of each method presented in table 4 was estimated.
24,"in the first scenario, the computational cost of classical cd methods were calculated with regard to the fact that the thresholding stage made through an operator."
24,"therefore, the required time for selecting the appropriate threshold will be considered in processing time."
24,"but in the second scenario, it is assumed that the thresholding stage has already been done for classical cd methods."
24,"as a result, the computational cost analyses are only related to the computational runtime of processing cores of proposed and classical methods."
24,"however, in both scenarios, the required time for automatic threshold selection is considered in the processing runtime of proposed cd methods."
24,"for a fair comparison, all classical and proposed cd methods were implemented in the same programming environment."
24,"since the runtime of the proposed kernel-based methods depend on the time of grid searching process for determining the optimized kernel parameter, therefore, it is assumed that the optimum kernel parameter is already known in both scenarios."
24,the computational cost analysis of classical cd and proposed cd methods for both datasets when threshold is estimated by an operator (first scenario) was given in figure 9.

25,"2015, 7 12853 as seen in figure 9, the computational runtime of proposed methods are less than the classical cd methods."
25,"in addition, dfss-sim and dfhs-sim approach have the lowest computational cost compared to other methods."
25,it is evident that the implementation of proposed cd method in similarity space decreases the processing times.
25,"furthermore, the conventional cd methods are largely dependent on the user interaction and are non-automatic."
25,determination of the exact threshold is very time consuming and requires a skilled operator.
25,the computational cost analysis of classical cd and proposed cd methods for both datasets with the thresholding stage pre-made in classical cd methods (second scenario) are presented in figure 10.
25,figure 10.
25,computational cost analysis of classical cd and proposed cd methods for quickbird and landsat datasets when the thresholding stage was pre-made in classical cd methods (second scenario).
25,"comparative computational cost analysis of proposed cd method against classical cd methods showed that (see figure 10), for both datasets, the lowest computational cost was obtained by using the subtraction method."
25,"this is closely followed by the sam, ratioing, dfss-sim and dfhs-sim approaches."
25,"although the threshold of the proposed method is selected automatically, the processing time does not significantly change compared to the conventional cd methods."
25,"for example, the processing time of dfss-sim, dfhs-sim, heap-spc, and svdd methods is far less than ica and mnf cd methods."
25,it can be concluded that the implementation of proposed cd method in similarity space decreases the processing times.
25,"consequently, in the absence of a skilled user, the processing time of conventional cd methods greatly increases."
25,"conclusions in this paper, a kernel-based and hybrid framework is presented for change detection from remotely sensed data in a similarity space."
25,this proposed method shows great flexibility for the problem of change detection by finding nonlinear solutions to the problem.
25,the main issues of the framework have been discussed and resolved.
25,"firstly, the initialization was addressed by finding a threshold on change vector magnitude distribution."
25,a geometrically and spectral similarity inspired cost function has been proposed to estimate the optimal single-time and cross-time kernel parameters.
25,this cost function produces clusters that minimize the similarity and maximize the distance between them.
25,"by exploiting a proper initialization, the kernel k-means clustering is used to extract the precise training samples for the two"
26,"remote sens. 2015, 7 12854 classes of interest."
26,"secondly, by reformulating the simple difference cd method in the hilbert space, the similarity of the difference image in feature spaces are strongly improved."
26,"this is accomplished by three approaches, i.e., dfss-sim, dfhs-sim, and heap-spc approaches."
26,"thirdly, multi-temporal images are transformed into the similarity space for increasing the separation between change and no-change classes and decreasing the time of the cd process."
26,"lastly, a new method to estimate the initial value of the rbf kernel parameter in the cd problem was proposed."
26,this method is based on a statistical method using the l2-norm distance and leads to a faster convergence of a grid-searching techniques for selecting the global optimum rbf’s kernel parameter.
26,"experimental comparisons showed that when only relying on the change’s magnitude, the correct discrimination of the changes becomes a difficult task."
26,"this is related to the ambiguity of the measure, as well as to the change’s magnitude one-dimensional representation, which hides the useful information in multi-temporal data."
26,almost all the classical methods are based on the change vector magnitude analysis and the determination of a threshold for separating the change pixels from the no-change ones.
26,"accordingly, the information between change and no-change pixels in multi-temporal images leads to a one-dimensional change vector."
26,while the proposed method uses all the multi-temporal bands and the mutual information between them.
26,"thus, more information can be extracted to separate the unchanged pixels from changed ones."
26,"in contrast, by detecting the changes in higher dimensional feature spaces, the multi-temporal information unfolds into clusters that are easily separable."
26,"such an approach also reduces the preprocessing corrections, for the single time information is considered separately and regularized by the cross-similarity of the scenes."
26,the proposed approach shows accuracy improvements with respect to classical change detection techniques.
26,this indicates that a better illustration can be obtained by considering cross information between multi-temporal images.
26,"this leads to a strong decrease in the false alarm rate, and a slight improvement in the detection rates in produced change maps."
26,"as a result, this approach is the most accurate one."
26,"finally, the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of proposed cd method in similarity space decrease the processing times."
26,further research can be done in the field of combining the multi-sensor data such as optic and radar imageries.
26,such information can be incorporated in the proposed cd framework by developing specific kernel functions.
26,types of changes and their change directions can also be considered to extend the use of the proposed cd framework for multi- class change detection.
