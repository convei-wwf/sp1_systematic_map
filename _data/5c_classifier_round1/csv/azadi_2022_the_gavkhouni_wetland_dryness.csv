2,"land surface temperature (lst) as an essential key parameter of the land environ- ment [8], and surface lst in micro, local, regional and global scales [9] is affected by changes in land surface characteristics such as vegetation cover and land use/cover [10]."
2,"therefore, a decrease in the wetland area or reduction of the amount of water in the wet- land may be associated with changes in lst."
2,"hence, the study of changes in lst, which plays an important role in the interaction between the surface and the atmosphere [11], is important, especially for aquatic ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions, which face various natural phenomena such as climate change, drought and also anthropogenic in- fluences."
2,remote sensing-based lst is a useful tool for studying land surface changes in spatial and temporal terms.
2,"despite the limited ground data, remote sensing techniques are used significantly to understand the changes in land surface properties and also to identify the behavior of climate variables due to the provision of extensive information at high resolution [12]."
2,"lst is used in various studies for different scientific purposes, e.g., vegetation and land use/cover changes [13–23], the urban heat island [24–26], drought monitoring [27–31], frost risk [32], land degradation [33,34], hydrological purposes [35,36]."
2,"among the various remote sensing indices, ndwi (normalized difference water index) is one of the most water practical indices used in many studies to track and predict wetland hydrological changes [37–40]."
2,"in addition, ndvi (normalized difference vegeta- tion index) has been used as a vegetation indicator to investigate changes in vegetation conditions [33,41]."
2,the gavkhouni wetland located in the eastern part of the zayandeh-rud river basin is fed by the zayandeh-rud river.
2,"in recent years, the wetland has dried up due to rainfall deficits, severe water shortages, human intervention and manipulation [42], and the transfer of chemical and physical pollutants, which have affected the conditions of the surrounding area and reduced the wetland’s services (https://www.iranaqua.ir, accessed on 1 august 2021)."
2,"due to the lack of in-situ meteorological data to study the air and land surface temperature changes, remote sensing techniques are used to understand the overall state of change in the wetland’s region."
2,"a few studies, especially using remote sensing data, were conducted for this wetland, such as mirahsani et al. [43], who focused on drought analysis using spi (the standardized precipitation index) and vci (the vegetation condition index) indices, and shiran et al. [44], who showed the relationship between ndvi and lst and land properties."
2,"a comprehensive understanding of wetland ecosystem services, especially from the ecological point of view, requires knowledge of the interaction between wetland and cli- matic parameters of the region."
2,"hence, research is needed on the impacts of the gavkhouni wetland dryness on regional climate variability to make appropriate river and wetland management decisions in this region."
2,"therefore, the main objective of the current study is quantifying the drying out of the gavkhouni wetland and its impact on air temperature variability over the study area."

12,discussion this study used observed data of temperature and river discharge in combination with remote sensing-based indices and lst to reveal the trend of the gavkhouni wetland dryness and its impact on the temperature of the surrounding areas.
12,"the results show that the drying of the wetland over the last two decades has led to a significant increase in air temperatures in the surrounding areas, especially in the west and northwest in spring and summer seasons."
12,"since 2000, the smallest wetland extent was observed in 2009, followed by 2011, 2017 and 2015."
12,"during all seasons (figures 6 and s1–s3), lst and air temperature in the gavkhouni wetland were lower than for the surrounding area, which can be explained by the high albedo of the salt deposits which are exposed during dry periods."
12,"in general, water has a low albedo and thus absorbs more incident visible and near-infrared solar radiance hence, the albedo increases due to the dryness of the wetland and the salt deposited there, leading to a decrease of lst."
12,"therefore, the wetland cannot balance its ambient temperatures."
12,the values of lst and tair_calc in the selected years show that the year 2009 was one of the driest years not only in iran but also in the entire middle east [50].
12,"the results also indicated a good correlation between lst and tair_obs (r2 = 094, r = 0.97) at the stations near the gavkhouni wetland (figures s4 and s5)."
12,jafari and hasheminasab [34] and shiran et al. [44] also showed that lst variable is a good tool for monitoring arid environments.
12,"in addition, the rmse was by an average of 3 ◦ c, but in general tair_calc values were consistent with changes in lst for most days and most parts of the studied area."
12,"the long-term seasonal average of observed air temperature (tair_obs_m) at varzaneh and hasanabad stations at 06:00 and 12:00 gmt (table 2) showed that at hasanabad at 06:00 tair_obs_m was higher than varzaneh in all seasons except summer, while at noon it was cooler than varzaneh station in all seasons."
12,the results of the mann-kendall (sens’s slope
13,"water 2022, 14, 172 13 of 16 estimator) from 1970 to 2019, in general, showed that the slope values of tmax_m changes before the year 2000 were often negative, while after the year 2000 were positive in half months."
13,"the slope values of tmin_m changes in varzaneh in the period before the year 2000 were higher in the cold months of the year than in the province and the country, while in the last 20 years were lower than the province and the country, which is related to the dryness of the wetland and its failure to play a role in regulating the surrounding temperature."
13,"in addition, in the warm months of the year, in the 30 years before and 20 years after 2000, the slope of tmin_m changes in varzaneh station was less and more, respectively, than both the province and country."
13,"in the 50 years, the maximum of the slope values of tmin_m changes between the three areas were observed in varzaneh station and months of october (0.1), september (0.09), and july (0.09), also in this period, the maximum difference of the slope of tmin_m between varzaneh and the country (0.05 ◦ c/year) was related to july (month of summer)."
13,"on 28 july 2009, when the wetland was in dry conditions, the tair_obs values at hasanabad and varzaneh stations at noontime had a difference of 2.5 ◦ c and 2.1 ◦ c, respectively, from the long-term average values."
13,"to confirm that the wetland dryness affects the climate in the surrounding areas, a t test analysis was used to compare the region’s temperature for the dry and wet wetland years."
13,"considering the significant results of the t test for the average of the minimum air temperature in varzaneh in most seasons, especially in spring and summer (table 3), and also the sen’s slope results, it can be said that in recent decades with the dryness of the gavkhouni wetland, the average minimum air temperature in spring and summer has increased by about 1.6 ◦ c and 1 ◦ c, respectively."
13,"therefore, from the analysis of the increase in air temperature at varzaneh and hasanabad stations on 28 july 2009, it can be concluded that the increase in temperature on this day at noontime was caused not only by global warming but also by the dryness of the gavkhouni wetland."
13,"in general, the gavkhouni wetland has been experienced dryness conditions mostly since the 2000s and 2010s decades."
13,"according to the ndvi and ndwi results, the negative trend from 1984 to 2020 indicates that the zayandeh-rud river has experienced dryness during this period that dried up the gavkhouni wetland which was a permanent wetland, and the vegetation near the wetland and its entrance decreased."
13,"these decreasing trends show that the spectral indices were almost consistent with the other evidence and observed data such as the time series of discharge values at varzaneh station (figure 5a,b) which clearly showed the wetland dryness."
13,"besides the drought occurrences, resulted from cli- mate change impact, the human activities in the basin have influenced the drying of the gavkhouni wetland."
13,"abou zaki et al. [51] also reported that even in arid and semi-arid climates, water scarcity is mainly due to anthropogenic reasons rather than climate."
13,"as pre- sented in other studies, the gavkhouni wetland dryness is related to population growth and bad management of water resources, such as upstream diversions and unreasonable transmissions of water resources in the basin [42], expansion of agricultural land and irrigation patterns causing hydrological droughts [51], dam construction in upstream of the zayandeh-rud river [34]."
13,"related to the remote sensing indices, their accuracy has been confirmed in other studies, such as eckert et al. [33] and shiran et al. [44] which indicated that the analysis of ndvi time series can be useful and appropriate to understand the changes in vegetation cover, and also in the study of jiang et al. [41] which showed the ndvi can accurately indicate the vegetation condition."
13,abou zaki et al. [51] also reported that ndwi is a reliable tool for studying the area of surface water bodies.
13,conclusions this study was conducted to determine the effects of the gavkhouni wetland dryness on temperature variations in the surrounding areas.
13,"in the last two decades, in addition to global warming impact (such as droughts caused by higher temperatures and evapotranspi- ration), wetland dryness caused by human activities has led to an increase in air and land surface temperatures in spring and summer, especially in the western and northwestern parts."
13,"from 1970 to 2019, the increase in air temperatures in the region was higher than in"
14,"water 2022, 14, 172 14 of 16 the isfahan province and iran in general."
14,"during the warm months, especially in july, this rate was about 0.02 to 0.06 ◦ c/year higher than the average for isfahan province and the country."
14,"from the current study, it can be concluded that monitoring changes in surface and air temperatures, as well as studying the drying trend of water bodies and their relationship with climate variability in surrounding areas, can be used to develop an integrated plan for managing wetlands and the river that feeds them."
14,the overall results of this study provide a basis for making effective decisions about allocating specific amounts of water to the gavkhouni wetland to maintain its climate and environmental functions.
