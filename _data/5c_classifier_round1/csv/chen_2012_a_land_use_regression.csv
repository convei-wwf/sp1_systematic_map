1,"we created land use regression (lur) models for so2 , no2 and pm10 for tianjin, china."
1,"traﬃc volumes, road networks, land use data, population density, meteorological conditions, physical conditions and satellite-derived greenness, brightness and wetness were used for predicting so2 , no2 and pm10 concentrations."
1,we incorporated data on industrial point sources to improve lur model performance.
1,"in order to consider the impact of diﬀerent sources, we calculated the psindex, lsindex and area of diﬀerent land use types (agricultural land, industrial land, commercial land, residential land, green space and water area) within diﬀerent buﬀer radii (1 to 20 km)."
1,this method makes up for the lack of consideration of source impact based on the lur model.
1,remote sensing-derived variables were signiﬁcantly correlated with gaseous pollutant concentrations such as so2 and no2 .
1,"r2 values of the multiple linear regression equations for so2 , no2 and pm10 were 0.78, 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, and the rmse values were 0.32, 0.18 and 0.21, respectively."
1,model predictions at validation monitoring sites went well with predictions generally within 15% of measured values.
1,"compared to the relationship between dependent variables and simple variables (such as traﬃc variables or meteorological condition variables), the relationship between dependent variables and integrated variables was more consistent with a linear relationship."
1,such integration has a discernable inﬂuence on both the overall model prediction and health eﬀects assessment on the spatial distribution of air pollution in the city region.
