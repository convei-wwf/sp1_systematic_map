1,"finally, the effects of seven problem parameters and players' confidence levels on pricing results are inves- tigated through sensitivity analyses."
1,the results show that the proposed methods are practicable and can offer guidance for the pricing decision of data products.
1,"keywords bertrand game, neutrosophic variable, pricing decision-making, risk aversion, stackelberg game 1 | i n t ro du ct i o n to date, global remote sensing satellites have been gradually achieved marketization and commercialization."
1,the satellite data acquired from remote sensing market platforms have been used in many areas and made great benefits.
1,"generally, pictures or videos remotely taken from satel- lites are called commercial remote satellite image data products (sidps)."
1,"as commercial products, the pricing of sidps is a key for providers to realize gains (ji et al., 2020)."
1,"nevertheless, no researches have been made on the pricing of sidps so far."
1,the purpose of this study is to exploit several sidps pricing methods where different market structures and the risk aversion of decision makers are considered in a neutrosophic environment.
1,the core incentives of this study come from the following threefold.
1,"for the sidps market, there is usually an oligopolistic structure and two game scenarios may exist in this market."
1,"the first one is the bertrand game scenario, where providers set their own pricings at the same time because of their same position in the market."
1,"the second one is the sta- ckelberg game scenario, where a provider first determines its pricing because of its leading position, and the follower makes decisions later."
1,"researchers have discussed the pricing issues with one of these two game scenarios (feng et al., 2020; liu et al., 2018; ma et al., 2018; taleizadeh expert systems. 2021;38:e12697. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/exsy © 2021 john wiley & sons ltd. 1 of 30 https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12697"

2,"see the terms and conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on wiley online library for rules of use; oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 2 of 30 luo and xing et al., 2019)."
2,"however, this is not enough because dissimilar power structures among players may substantially affect the pricing decisions."
2,"there- fore, it is necessary to explore the pricing strategy of sidps with different power structures."
2,many existing pricing methods are proposed in a certain decision-making circumstance.
2,"in other words, most of these methods are based on an assumption that all problem parameters, such as cost and demand, are crisp values."
2,"nevertheless, some parameters may have inherent ambiguity."
2,"for sidps pricing decision makers, as opposed to acquiring accurate values, they may more readily make approximate assessments of several important parameters."
2,"to this end, some researchers focus on investigating the pricing issues in fuzzy decision environments (alamdar et al., 2018; al-mousa & faza, 2019; taleizadeh et al., 2020; yang & xiao, 2017)."
2,"however, uncertain parameters are all denoted by fuzzy sets in these studies environments (alamdar et al., 2018; al-mousa & faza, 2019; taleizadeh et al., 2020; yang & xiao, 2017)."
2,a typical feature of fuzzy sets is that it has only a member- ship degree expressed in a numeric way.
2,it can neither adequately describe vague information nor facilitate decision makers to provide accurate mem- bership degree.
2,"recently, some researchers try to describe vague parameters in pricing problems in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy sets."
2,"even though the membership and non-membership degrees can be fully reflected with intuitionistic fuzzy sets, the hesitant degrees of players are not considered in the pricing process (wang & li, 2020)."
2,"to overcome the inherent limitation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, samrandache (1999) put forward the neutrosophic set theory."
2,"three membership functions exist in neutrosophic sets for adequately capturing the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees of experts."
2,"thus, this study plans to sufficiently depict players' fuzzy cognitions with the aid of neutrosophic notion."
2,a limitation of most existing literature related to fuzzy pricing game is that players are supposed to be perfectly rational.
2,"in other words, deci- sion makers are assumed to be seeking to maximize their expected profits."
2,"nevertheless, players usually have limited rationality and they may consider possible risks in the decision-making process."
2,"in this case, optimistic value theory is a good choice to describe the risk aversion behav- iours of decision makers."
2,both expected value theory and optimistic value theory belong to credibility methods.
2,"compared with expected value theory, optimistic value theory aims to calculate the optimistic value of profits with a confidence level."
2,"to date, several researchers have intro- duced the optimistic value theory into diverse game issues."
2,"however, to the best of our knowledge, few researches have been made on the fuzzy pricing game with risk aversion."
2,"hence, this study discusses the risk aversion behaviours of pricing decision makers under different fuzzy game scenarios."
2,"the innovations and contributions are: first, the pricing decision-making problems of data products are solved with game theory, and two pricing strategies are provided by analysing dissimilar game structures."
2,"second, the uncertainty of problem parameters in pricing models is consid- ered with the aid of neutrosophic set theory."
2,"to date, the game theory has been extended to neutrosophic environment in little literature (de et al., 2020; pramanik & roy, 2014)."
2,"different from them (de et al., 2020; pramanik & roy, 2014), a new notion of neutrosophic variables is utilized in this study."
2,"neutrosophic variables possess the same strengths of neutrosophic sets, namely, fully conveying parameters' uncertainty with three independent membership functions."
2,"furthermore, compared with neutrosophic sets, they are more convenient and objective for players in terms of determining numeric membership degrees."
2,"third, the bounded rationality and risk aversion behaviours of decision makers are taken into account using optimistic value theory."
2,"unlike maximizing the expected profits in existing literature, the objective function of pricing models in this study is to maximize the optimistic value of profits with players' confidence levels."
2,"as a result, sidps pricing techniques with risk aversion are developed in fuzzy environments."
2,"fourth, full discussions are conducted through numerical examples with results analyses, sensitivity analyses of problem parameters and confidence levels."
2,the remainder of this study is designed as follows.
2,a focused literature review is conducted in section 2.
2,section 3 introduces basic knowl- edge of fuzzy variables and neutrosophic variables.
2,"in section 4, the pricing decision-making issue of sidps is described."
2,"afterwards, two neutrosophic game pricing methods with risk aversion are suggested to solve pricing problems in section 5."
2,section 6 discusses some numerical examples and conducts results analyses.
2,"additionally, comparative analyses and sensitivity analyses of seven problem parameters and two confi- dence levels are made."
2,"in section 7, some necessary conclusions are provided."
2,"2 | literature review game theory is a powerful tool to deal with pricing decision-making problems, and many pricing techniques based on game theory have been explored."
2,"for example, zeng et al. (2017) designed a bertrand game pricing mode for the sensor network; taleizadeh et al. (2019) adopted game- theoretical methods to solve substitutable products pricing problems; zhang et al. (2020) combined genetic algorithm and stackelberg game to address joint production and pricing problems; and feng et al. (2020) proposed a stackelberg game pricing framework for the demand response of power systems."
2,"moreover, some researchers focus on investigating the pricing issues under different game structures."
2,"for instance, jamali and rasti-barzoki (2018) built the green and non-green product pricing models in the centralized and decentralized circumstances; yan et al. (2020) determined equilibrium prices of e-retailer finance in horizontal and vertical games; and safarzadeh et al. (2020) provided a multi-stage game framework for energy-efficient appliances pricing considering two different game settings."

3,"for instance, alamdar et al. (2018) investigated the pricing issues of a fuzzy three-level supply chain; and taleizadeh et al. (2020) built a fuzzy stackelberg game pricing model in closed-loop supply chains."
3,"on other hand, to simultaneously describe subjective preferences and objective facts, pricing issues have been investigated in intuitionistic environments."
3,"for example, charwand and gitizadeh (2018) designed a robust framework to determine satis- factory time-of-use electricity pricing based on intuitionistic fuzzy divergence; an and li (2019) investigated the constrained bi-matrix games with intuitionistic fuzzy payoffs; and jafarian et al. (2019) discussed the forward and reverse flows pricing decisions using intuitionistic fuzzy game theory."
3,neutrosophic set is an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets.
3,it can overcome the inherent limitation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets through three independent membership functions.
3,"different attitudes (the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees) of decision makers can be fully reflected with neutrosophic sets."
3,"to date, plenty of techniques have been widely developed in neutrosophic environments to solve problems in different fields."
3,"recently, long et al. (2019) extended the association matrix into neutrosophic environments for addressing fuzzy clustering issues; pamucar et al. (2020) presented a hybrid decision method to select suitable suppliers under neutrosophic circumstances; and abdel-basset et al. (2020) scheduled the time in projects and assessed the linear time–cost tradeoffs with neutrosophic numbers."
3,"however, few pricing deci- sions have been made within a neutrosophic environment."
3,"for example, pramanik and roy (2014) analysed the indo-park conflict with the aid of game theory and neutrosophic membership functions; and de et al. (2020) introduced fuzzy neutrosophic offset into game theory for getting bet- ter solutions of economic production quantity (epq) model."
3,"on the other hand, for describing the limited rationality of decision makers, several researchers have introduced the optimistic value theory into game issues."
3,"for example, liu and xu (2014) calculated the optimal pricing of competitive supply chains according to the α-optimistic values of fuzzy variables under stackelberg game scenarios; yang and gao (2017) resolved the two-firm advertising problem with α-optimistic equilib- rium strategy; tan et al. (2018) discussed the bounded rationality behaviours of players using a α-optimistic value criterion in fuzzy bertrand game; brikaaa et al. (2019) constructed a tourism planning management model with α-optimistic value theory; and tang and li (2020) investigated a novel uncertain bimatrix game with optimistic value criteria."
3,3 | b a s i c kn o wl ed g e basic knowledge of fuzzy variables and neutrosophic variables is introduced in this section.
3,3.1 | fuzzy variables definition 1.
3,"(liu & liu, 2009) let φ be a non-empty set, whose power set is s(φ) and the credibility measure is cr."
3,"then a credibility space can be denoted as (φ, s(φ), cr), where cr : φ !"
3,"[0, 1] represents the credibility of an event happening."
3,definition 2.
3,"(liu & liu, 2009) for any credibility measure, the following is true: 1."
3,"if φ is a universal set, then cr{φ} = 1; 2."
3,"if ac is the complementary set of a, then cr{a} + cr{ac} = 1; 3."
3,"if b is a subset of a, then cr{a} ≥ cr{b}."
3,example 1.
3,"suppose φ = {a, b}, then four events (ϕ, {a}, {b} and φ) are included."
3,"if cr{ϕ} = 0, cr{a} = 0.4, cr{b} = 0.6 and cr{φ} = 1, then cr is a credibility measure, and it meets the requirements in definition 2."
3,definition 3.
3,"(liu & liu, 2009) assume (φ, s(φ), cr) is a credibility space, then ℓ can be called a fuzzy variable with a membership function μℓ(x) = (2cr{ℓ = x}) ^ 1."
3,example 2.
3,"a concrete example of fuzzy variable is triangular fuzzy variable, which is expressed by a triplet ℓ = [l, m, h] with l ≤ m ≤ h, and its membership functions is 8 > > x −l > > , when l ≤ x ≤ m < m− l μℓ ðxþ = h− x : ð1þ > > , when m ≤ x ≤ h > : h −m > 0, otherwise"

4,"(samrandache, 1999) a neutrosophic set n in a domain x can be denoted by tn(x), in(x) and fn(x)."
4,"they are three independent mem- bership functions, where tn(x) : x !"
4,"]−0, 1+[ is the truth membership function, in(x) : x !"
4,"]−0, 1+[ is the indeterminacy membership function, fn(x) : x !"
4,"]−0, 1+[ is the falsity membership function, and −0 ≤ sup{tn(x)} + sup{in(x)} + sup{fn(x)} ≤ 3+."
4,"however, it is not easy for neutrosophic set (samrandache, 1999) to be directly applied in practice."
4,"to overcome such limitation, wang et al. (2010) put forward the notion of single-valued neutrosophic set."
4,definition 6.
4,"(wang et al., 2010) a single-valued neutrosophic set v in a domain x can be denoted as v = {(x, tv(x), iv(x), fv(x))j x  x}, where tv(x), iv(x) and fv(x) are the truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership functions, respectively."
4,"moreover, tv(x), iv(x), fv(x)  [0, 1] and 0 ≤ sup {tv(x)} + sup{iv(x)} + sup{fv(x)} ≤ 3."
4,"specifically, v is degenerated into a single-valued neutrosophic number v = (tv, iv, fv) if only one element exists in x."
4,"based on the conceptions of fuzzy variable and single-valued neutrosophic set, neutrosophic variable can be defined in the following. χ and χ −, their combination is called a neutrosophic variable χ, whose truth, indeterminacy and falsity definition 7."
4,"given three fuzzy variables χ +, ~ membership functions are: t χ ðxþ = t χ + ðxþ = ð2crfχ + = xgþ^1, ð4þ iχ ðxþ = 1 −t ~χ ðxþ = 1− ð2crf~ χ = xgþ^1, ð5þ f χ ðxþ = 1 −t χ − ðxþ = 1 − ð2crfχ − = xgþ^1: ð6þ χ < 0g = 0 and cr{χ − < 0} = 0."

11,"subse- quently, two proposed methods are utilized to obtain the pricing results under two game scenarios, respectively."
11,"for the bertrand game scenario, two optimal pricing decisions are determined according to equation (34) and equation (35) as: z1 ≈ 181:82 and z2 ≈ 181:82; based on equation (24),     ^1 the α-optimistic values of two providers' profit are: p ≈ 13388:43 and p^2 ≈ 13388:43; and the α-optimistic values of the total profit is     α1 o α2 o ^1 p + p^2 = 26776:86."

11,"nevertheless, an interesting finding is that the profit of the first provider is less than that of the second one under the stakelberg game scenario."
11,it indicates that a leader may not always take advantage of the leadership authority to achieve more earnings.
11,"obviously, it is more benefit for consumers when providers play the bertrand game."
11,"6.2 | comparative analyses in this subsection, comparative analyses are made with other existing methods to justify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches."

11,"that is, let c1 = c2 = 100, ^1 = d d ^2 = 200, ^e1 = ^e2 = 2:0 and ^ g = 1:8."
11,"then, using the bertrand game method in (zeng et al., 2017), the optimal pricings and providers' profits are     calculated as: z1 ≈ 181:82, z2 ≈ 181:82, p ^1 ≈ 13388:43 and p^2 ≈ 13388:43."
11,"on the other hand, using the stackelberg game method in α1 o α2 o   (zhang et al., 2020), the optimal pricings and providers' profits are calculated as: z1 ≈ 209:66 , z2 ≈ 194:35 , p ^1 ≈ 14311:13 and   α1 o ^ p2 ≈ 17803:37."
11,"it can be seen that the decision results are the same with those in section 6.1, which indicates the effectiveness of the pro- α2 o posed approaches to an extent."
11,"subsequently, several common uncertain decision circumstances are taken into account and the sidps pricing problem is solved by some existing methods and the proposed approaches."
11,"for better comparisons, suppose two providers are risk-averse, and the confidence levels of them are α1 = α2 = 0.4."

12,"similarly, the α-optimistic values of providers' profits and the total profits are unequal under diverse uncertain circumstances."
12,"specifically, when two providers are in the bertrand game scenario, the highest pricings and the α-optimistic values of providers' profits are obtained with the proposed approaches, followed by the intuitionistic fuzzy pricing approach (jafarian et al., 2019), and the fuzzy pricing approach (tan et al., 2018) comes last."
12,"when two providers are in the stackelberg game scenario, similar conclusions can be drawn."
12,"furthermore, the α-optimistic value of the total profit obtained in the neutrosophic environment is more than twice that in the intuitionistic fuzz environment (jafarian et al., 2019), and more than three times that in the fuzzy environment (liu & xu, 2014)."
12,6.3 | sensitivity analyses 6.3.1 | problem parameters analyses the influences of several important problem parameters on pricing decisions are examined in this subsection.
12,results are displayed in appendix a.
12,"according to figure a1, it is clear that increasing the cost c1 leads a growth in the optimal pricings of both two providers."
12,"then, the α-optimistic value of the second provider's profit increases."
12,"however, the α-optimistic value of the first provider's profit significantly decreases because of its rising cost."
12,"as a result, there is a decline in the α-optimistic value of providers' total profits."
12,these conclusions are true for the bertrand and stackelberg game scenarios.
12,"according to figure a2, it can be seen that the optimal pricings of two providers rise with the increase of the cost c2 under the bertrand game setting."
12,there is also a growth in the α-optimistic value of the first provider's profit.
12,"nevertheless, a decline exists in the α-optimistic values of the first provider's profit and two providers' total profits."
12,"moreover, similar conclusions can be obtained when two providers play the stackelberg game."
12,"according to figures a3 and a4, it is true that regardless of the game scenarios, the increase of potential demand d^1 or d^2 has a positive influ- ^2 and p ^1 , p ence on all decision results, namely, the values of z1 and z2 , and the α-optimistic values of p ^2 ."
12,"furthermore, the variations of these ^1 + p results under the bertrand game scenario are slighter than those under the stackelberg game scenario."
12,"according to figures a5 and a6, it is clear that that regardless of the game scenarios, the increase of price elasticity coefficient ^e1 or ^e2 makes ^2 and p ^1 , p a negative effect on all decision results, namely, the values of z1 and z2 , and the α-optimistic values of p ^2 ."
12,"additionally, the change ^1 + p of these results under the bertrand game scenario is less than those under the stackelberg game scenario."
12,"according to figure a7, it can be seen that regardless of the game scenarios, the increase of cross-price elasticity coefficient ^ g produces a ^2 and p ^1 , p positive effect on all decision results, namely, the values of z1 and z2 , and the α-optimistic values of p ^2 ."
12,"moreover, the alterations ^1 + p of these results under the bertrand game scenario are smaller than those under the stackelberg game scenario."
12,6.3.2 | confidence levels analyses the influences of two providers' confidence levels on pricing decisions are examined in this subsection.
12,"the confidence levels α1  [0, 1] and α2  [0, 1] represent the risk avoidance degrees of two providers, respectively."
12,when the confidence level of a certain provider is between 0 and
13,"14680394, 2021, 5, downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exsy.12697 by university of california, wiley online library on [04/10/2024]."
13,"see the terms and conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on wiley online library for rules of use; oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license luo and xing 13 of 30 0.5, this provider has a low risk aversion degree; otherwise, this provider has a high risk aversion degree."
13,"based on this definition, four combina- tions of two providers' risk aversion degrees can be obtained."
13,"taking into account two different game scenarios, there are eight cases for confi- dence levels sensitivity analyses, which are displayed in appendix b."
13,"(note that because the customer demand and sidps pricing should be no less than 0, the range of α1, α2 may be different in each case and is less than [0,1])."
13,"according to figures b1 and b2, it can be seen that when two providers are low risk-averse, the confidence levels α1 and α2 have negative ^2 and p ^1 , p effects on all decision results."
13,"that is, the values of z1 and z2 , and the α-optimistic values of p ^2 decrease with the growth of α1 or ^1 + p α2."
13,"second, for the first provider, the variations of these decision results are greater when only the value of α1 changes than only the value of α2 changes; while for the second provider, the variations of these decision results are greater when only the value of α2 changes than only the value of α1 changes."
13,it indicates that the pricing and profit of a certain provider are more influenced by its own confidence level than by others.
13,"further- more, these conclusions are true under two game scenarios."
13,the difference is that two providers can set higher sidps pricings under the sta- ckelberg game scenario than under the bertrand game scenario.
13,"according to figures b3 and b4, it is clear that when the first provider is high risk-averse and the second provider is low risk-averse, the con- fidence levels α1 and α2 have negative influences on all decision results."
13,"that is, increasing the value of α1 or α2 can decline the values of z1 and z2 ^2 and p ^1 , p , and the α-optimistic values of p ^2 ."
13,"similarly, the changes of these decision results are more influenced by a providers' own confi- ^1 + p dence level than others."
13,"an interesting finding is that the second provider can set higher sidps pricing and achieve more profits than the second provider in most cases, even he/she is a follower under the stackelberg game scenario."
13,"the reason may be that the second provider has the bene- fit of its low risk avoidance degree, while the first provider may suffer more from its high risk avoidance degree than he/she gains from its leader- ship position."
13,"according to figures b5 and b6, it is true that when the first provider is low risk-averse and the second provider is high risk-averse, the confi- dence levels α1 and α2 have negative effects on all decision results."
13,"that is, when rising the value of α1 or α2, the values of z1 and z2 , and the ^1 , p α-optimistic values of p ^1 + p ^2 and p ^2 decrease."
13,"similarly, the changes of these decision results are more influenced by a providers' own confi- dence level than others."
13,"moreover, the sidps pricing of the first provider is higher than that of the second provider in most cases because of its low risk avoidance degree."
13,"according to figures b7 and b8, it can be seen that when two providers are high risk-averse, the confidence levels α1 and α2 have negative ^2 and p ^1 , p effects on all decision results."
13,"that is, the values of z1 and z2 , and the α-optimistic values of p ^2 decline with the rise of α1 or α2."
13,"^1 + p similarly, the changes of these decision results are more influenced by a providers' own confidence level than others."
13,"an interesting finding is that compared with the situation where at least one provider is low risk-averse, the pricings and profits of two providers are relatively lower in this case."
13,this further illustrates the possible beneficial effect of low risk aversion and possible adverse effect of high risk aversion for providers.
13,7 | c o n cl u s i o n s this study developed the pricing techniques for data products in a neutrosophic circumstance.
13,"the main advantages of the proposed methods include: first, pricing models were built according to different game settings so that the effects of power structures can be observed."
13,"second, neutrosophic variables were adopted to express the uncertainty of problem parameters (such as consumer demand and elasticity coefficients)."
13,"compared with fuzzy variables or neutrosophic sets, neutrosophic variables provide a more convenient and accessible way for players to suffi- ciently convey ambiguous perceptions."
13,"third, the limited rationality of decision makers were considered based on the optimistic value of neutrosophic variables."
13,the optimistic value theory can reflect the risk aversion behaviours of players by calculating the optimistic value of pro- viders' profits in a certain confidence level.
13,"then, numerical instances were provided after the equilibrium solutions of pricing models were derived."
13,"finally, the impacts of power structures, problem parameters and confidence levels on pricing results were investigated with full sensitiv- ity analyses."
13,"however, there are still some limitations."
13,"for example, the demand function should be improved in the future because it is not always a linear expression with respect to price."
13,"second, only two players were included in the proposed game model, n-person game scenarios will be investi- gated in the future."
13,"moreover, the proposed methods can be modified according to the specific features of other optimization problems for better resolving those issues."
