1,the aim of the present study was to develop a methodology for characterising fuel models using low-density and free lidar data that facilitate the work of managers of protected territories.
1,field inventories were carried out in order to understand the characteristics of the stand and the variables that fuel models must include.
1,"this information, together with the use of the intensity and structure provided by lidar, was used to perform statistical analyses."
1,the linear regressions obtained to characterise the stand of the mixed quercus spp.–pinus ssp.-dominated stand had an r2 value ranging from 0.4393 to 0.66.
1,"while working with low-density lidar data (which has more difficulties crossing the canopy), in addition to the obtained results, we performed the statistical analysis of the dominant stand to obtain models with r2 values ranging from 0.8201 to 0.8677."

1,"in addition to these costs, these fires have had negative effects on properties, air quality, and natural received: 17 june 2021 habitats [2]."
1,"due to the strong relationship between meteorology and fire occurrence [3], a accepted: 26 july 2021 link between wildfires and climate change has been established [4,5]."
1,"consequently, areas published: 29 july 2021 that previously had a low probability of being devastated by wildfires are now more likely to be affected."
1,"publisher’s note: mdpi stays neutral therefore, modelling, analysis, and risk studies have intensified."

1,"the topography is the most stable feature, as it is not modified in short intervals of time, and we cannot modify it."
1,climatology and meteorology data can be easily obtained from the network of existing stations [7].

2,"forests 2021, 12, 1011 2 of 18 for the mapping of fuels, the use of remote sensing has been more frequently incor- porated among the scientific and management community, reducing the time and costs needed to map large and complex surfaces."
2,lidar technology has gained momentum and relevance.
2,"in its beginnings, it only recorded one return per pulse emitted."
2,"it currently works with multi-return lidar sensors capable of capturing up to six returns from a single pulse [13], which has improved the amount of provided information."
2,"this demonstrates that the data obtained from different returns (or penetration of the signal) can be used to analyse vegetation [14], as lidar enables researchers to obtain information at differ- ent structural levels."
2,"therefore, various studies have used lidar for the modelling and characterisation of forest fuels [15,16]."
2,the main objective of this study was to provide managers of protected areas a tool that allows them to know the characteristics of inaccessible stands in order to assign fuel models.
2,"using this, they will be able to characterise the fuel patterns of areas in order to obtain updated information before the occurrence of a forest fire."
2,"in the case of protected natural areas, it is not easy to carry out field inventories, as various difficulties limit the characterisation of forest fuels using field-sampling procedures."
2,"the low density of forest roads, topographic relief, and the limitations of access and mobility (often due to the delimitation of restricted areas) complicate the monitoring of plant structures in order to characterise their combustibility and flammability."
2,"in this sense, through lidar, a methodology that solves the identification of polygons of fuel models without direct testing in the field was developed in this study."
2,this solution provides an efficient way to map fuels in protected areas.
2,the lidar tool allowed the authors of the present work to evaluate and categorise the composition of plant structures to identify fuel models and to generate algorithms to predict stand variables in relation to the characterisation of tree crowns.
2,the achieved results have made it possible to generate equations that determine variables that are part of crown fire behaviour prediction models [17] and calculate the difficulty of suppression [18].
2,"according to the achieved results, it is important to indicate the application of our results for fire managers in decision- making for the prevention and suppression of forest fires."
2,"furthermore, considering the planning aspects of fire management programs, the methodology developed in this work incorporates good opportunities to integrate the variables of the characterisation of forest fuels obtained through lidar in decision trees and other field tools."

4,this allowed us to divide the area into smaller zones and make the computer processing faster because the processing of this information for all study areas at once was impossible.

4,information cartography itineraries lidar vegetation type x x life form x x plant taxa x x position x x the used open access cartography was from the information system on land occupa- tion of spain (siose) [23] that uses the photointerpretation of various types of images to define the polygons of the types of vegetation.
4,"siose provides information of the spatial distribution of different types of vegetation, as well as the cover of trees, scrubs, and plants taxa."
4,the used itineraries were the national forest itinerary (inf) [24] and the itinerary realised in the resource management project of the area; their use with siose allowed us to know whether the information about the plant taxa was correct and correct it if necessary.
4,"lidar was used to confirm the location, position, and type of vegetation."
4,"however, it was primarily used to obtain the structure and cover of the vegetation."
4,this information not only allowed us to define better the areas of each fuel model but also helped us characterise the study area.
4,our workflow is shown in figure 2.
4,"the objective of the determination of the fuel models was to assign a fuel load to evaluate the suppression difficulty index [18,25]."
4,"this variable is necessary to determine the energy behaviour sub-index that can be used calculate surface, crown, and eruptive fires."
4,"design of sample plots for model characterisation in the study area, p, pm, and m areas are scarce and large fires have a tendency to occur in forest systems dominated by a tree stratum in the vicinity of the area."
4,"thus, in this study, we focused on the groups of woody fuels, namely hpm and hr."
4,"we conducted a simple random pre-sampling of 12 circular plots with a radius of 20 m, with an overall surface area of 1256.64 m2 each one."
4,the field variables were evaluated by different tools.
4,a topcon gms-2 gps was used to determinate the centre points of the plots where the data were recollected.
4,"a hypsometer vertex iv was used to find the heights of the trees, base canopies, and crowns."
4,"a pi tape was used to measure the normal crown diameter, and a metric tape was used to define the plots limits, crown diameters, and scrub heights."
4,"the tree and scrub canopy covers were measured and then assigned a number from 1 to 4, with 1 representing the range between 0 and 25%, 2 representing the range between >25 and 50%, 3 representing the range between >50 and 75%, and 4 representing the range between 75 and 100%."
4,the plots were collected at the points shown in figure 3.
4,"the predominant species was pinus pinaster; the variables that were measured in field were normal diameter, crown height, crown diameter with two measurements, height, age, species and fraction of tree and shrub canopy cover, mean shrub height, and the species comprising that stratum."
4,data were collected for each individual tree in the plot to calculate the density of trees.
4,this pre-sample was done to understand the variability of the forest stand.
4,"knowing the density of trees in these 12 plots, a statistics study was conducted to determine the number of plots necessary to reach a 90% (accuracy) of fiducial probability."
4,"with this, we avoided making more or less plots than necessary, so costs were optimised."
4,"furthermore, this allowed us to obtain errors within our margins and guaranteed that the next static analyses were based on a reliable source."

11,"discussion the use of the pnoa lidar to estimate stand variables has some limitations [29,30]."
11,"as can be seen, the mean height and height at the base of the canopy did not yield good fits, although the variables were significant."
11,"similar results were observed for other parameters, such as basal area, normal diameter, and understory height."
11,"this was because the density of pulses was low, so it was difficult for a high number of pulses to penetrate the tree canopy and provide information on the vegetation below the canopy."
11,"in the area under study, the canopy usually has no gaps, and it is possible that in more open areas, such as a dehesa, the study of the stand characteristics with the pnoa lidar information would yield better results [31]."
11,"to confirm this assumption, the same statistical study was carried out using the stand characteristics while differentiating them by genus, and we obtained the results shown in table 5 for pine stands."
11,the results obtained for quercus spp. are not shown in detail because their abundance was low and only generated noise.
11,the low density of pulses made it difficult to obtain information in stands with two strata where one is dominated by the other.
11,"the resulting models have shown strong quality compared to those of other studies in which statistical analysis was performed using lidar data with a higher density of points, such as the one developed in [32], in which the density was more than 4 pulses/m2 with an r2 of 0.63 for the basal area variable."
11,"the results obtained in the characterisation of the fuel models at the individual and group levels indicated that in most cases, the predicted individual model was associated with another nearby model within the same group, so it is necessary its adjust for future use."
11,"the number of times a litterfall residual model was confounded with a scrub grass litterfall model is relatively high, so it would be appropriate to study these specific cases to know the fit of the variables or even to add some new ones."
11,"the precision of the scrub group was low and confused with the groups associated with trees because they were vertically distributed at the same level as quercus spp., in addition to the fact that there were no large areas in which only scrub could be found, as can be seen in the number of plots that this group had compared to the rest of the groups."
11,"therefore, it would be a good idea in the future to include basal area variable in order to be able to better discern in which cases this is sufficiently high enough to be considered a limiting factor for differentiation."
11,"another possibility is that actions were carried out between the flight and the field visit, so the structure obtained with lidar did not represent reality and, therefore, the predicted model."
12,"forests 2021, 12, 1011 12 of 18 the results obtained in this work had close relationships with the vegetation cover of the pilot area defined for the development of the methodology."
12,"in the sampled area, shrub, grassland, and slash models were found to have a low presence."
12,"in order to increase the precision of the developed algorithms, the methodology is being applied in other protected areas of the natural park where the representativeness of these groups of fuel models is greater."
12,this activity will allow us to evaluate the predictive capacity of the algorithms and facilitate their applicability to other forest landscapes.
12,"the improvement in the methodology used has been substantial, as it allows for the accurate updating of an area with a minimum need for field visits."
12,this update of the coverage used in fuel models implies improvements in the optimisation of prevention by allowing researchers to carry out simulations of potential fires with greater precision.
12,the best adjustment in the identification and characterisation of fuel models through the developed lidar methodology will help to increase the quality and accuracy of the prioritisation indices of defence actions against forest fires.
12,"in this sense, indices that evaluate the potential fire behaviour (pfbi), the energetic release component of fire propagation (ice), and extinction difficulty (sdi) calculated based on a better quality of forest fuel maps can decrease uncertainty in decision making."
12,"forests 2021, 12, x for peer review 13 of 18 these indices will also help to optimize firefighting tasks, since forest fires will be less likely to behave in an unexpected way (figure 7)."

13,"likewise, the flow chart of the methodology and the division of the surface into groups with different types of vegetation provide an application guide in other territories."
13,this advantage provides solutions to managers with responsibilities in the prevention and extinction of forest fires.
13,the results of this study show that the generated information related to combustibility has a high level of adjustment.
13,this quality affects the characterisation of indices that pre- dict the energy behaviour of fires.
13,"these indices improve the ability to predict suppression opportunities in operational scenarios, assisting managers in planning activities for fire defence in forest landscapes."
13,another consequence of this study is our reduction of uncertainty by using an updated and high precision fuel model mapping.
13,"with the results obtained in this study, it is possible to identify areas that are optimal for extinguishing forest fires and to locate areas that can be adapted for use and that do not have safety conditions for firefighters to carry out suppression activities."
13,these tools will undoubtedly increase the safety of suppression operations and reduce uncertainty.
