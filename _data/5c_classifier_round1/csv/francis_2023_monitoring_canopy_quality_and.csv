1,"using canopy cover alone to make policy decisions is problematic because the height of trees (poulsen et al., 2020), species of cities across the world such as london, singapore, and nairobi have trees (franceschi et al., 2022), leaf area index (rahman et al., 2015), and set forth tree planting initiatives as part of larger efforts to mitigate local environmental conditions (wang et al., 2022), all influence how climate change, improve quality of life, and promote environmental much benefit is gained from investments in additional urban greenery. equity (mayor of london, 2022; tress 2023; nyamasege, 2022)."

2,wang et al. (2022) canopy estimates from imagery when and where lidar data is un­ showed that while the urban canopy can be an effective way to reduce available.
2,"for example, image segmentation has been used to identify elevated temperatures caused by the urban heat island (uhi) effect, the individual trees using natural rgb (red, green, and blue) images cooling efficiency of the tree canopy can vary substantially within cities (weinstein et al., 2019, amati et al., 2023), while multi-spectral (ms) due to local conditions."
2,"this relationship between trees and their cooling imagery has been used to predict forest canopy height (li et al., 2020). efficiency has been well explored, particularly in relation to the amount once urban canopy estimates are identified, the complicated deci­ of impervious surface that exists within communities (ziter et al., 2019), sion of where specifically to plant trees arises."
2,"to tackle this challenge, the species of tree (rahman et al., 2020), the level of social vulnerability bodnaruk et al. (2017) focused on the mitigation of environmental within communities (zhou et al., 2021), and the height of the tree stressors such as air pollution and the uhi effect when developing canopy (chen et al., 2020; shahidan et al., 2012)."
2,research has optimization algorithms for determining new tree locations.
2,"in boston, confirmed that prioritizing locations with higher cooling efficiencies can danford et al. (2014) used the gini index, a measure of the degree of lead to greater reductions in uhi per tree planted."
