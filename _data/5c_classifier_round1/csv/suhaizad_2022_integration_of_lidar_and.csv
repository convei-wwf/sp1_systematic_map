1,"without proper maintenance and mitigating, the hazardous trees with structural defects can be harmful to the local community."
1,"in practice, the hazardous trees can be assessed using visual tree assessment (vta), expertise interview and questionnaire."
1,the advancement in remote sensing technology provides users with alternative ways to identify the hazardous trees and is very efficient especially in large areas.
1,the intent of this study is to identify the potential of the tree hazard in uitm shah alam from the integration of lidar and pleiades dataset.
1,tree health condition and tree height were derived from lidar and pleiades dataset.
1,height of trees were extracted from a digital canopy height model (dchm) and the condition of tree health were assessed based on the normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) values.
1,"both parameters were used to classify the individual into low, moderate and high-risk ratings."
1,the findings demonstrated that the integration of both datasets successfully identified the potential of tree hazard at the study area.
1,altogether 108 of individual trees were detected. 7 and 67 trees were identified as high and moderate risk respectively.
1,this study derived significant findings that can be used to support the maintenance of tree activities in the campus area and significant to private and government sectors such park management and local authorities.
1,introduction a tree is taken into account as hazardous if its and recommend corrective actions before the trees defects will cause a failure and hit something as it fail.
1,tree-risk assessments can help communities falls.
1,not all tree hazards are obviously visible until quantify the level of risk to public safety and an extreme weather event exposes their weakness. prioritize implementation of corrective actions.
1,"the in other words, in order for a tree to be thought of as potential of tree hazard can be classified into three hazardous, it should have a structural weakness levels of hazard rating which are low, moderate and (cahoon, 2020)."
1,"cracks, weak branch unions, high (chuon et al., 2011). branch decay, root damage, and root disease are based on the previous studies, there are some common indicators of structural weakness that methods used in identifying hazardous trees, should be checked or observed on a constant especially in the urban areas."
1,"according to schedule (national tree safety group, 2011)."
1,"sreetheran et al., (2011), a form was used to record moreover, multiple and connected defects increase information such as tree species, tree structure, tree the potential of failure."
1,"trees with unbalanced or health, and hazard status for tree risk assessment asymmetrical crowns may have their weight and the street tree inventory."
1,the tree height was distributed incorrectly throughout the stem.
1,"these measured with a hypsometer, and the crown trees are vulnerable to failure when combined with diameter and diameter at breast height (dbh) were other flaws such as decay and root disease (smiley, measured using tape."
1,"the hazardous trees also can 2008). be identified using the delphi method hazard-rating assessment is the evaluation of the (maruthaveeran and yaman, 2010)."
1,"this is a individual tree that has the potential to fall and can procedure for obtaining the most credible consensus cause damage to the surrounding area, especially of opinion from a group of experts. during extreme weather events."
1,"the main objective the process of visual tree assessment is an of tree risk assessments is to identify defective trees establish method in identifying the hazardous trees in high-risk areas, assess the severity of the defects, however it will be challenging for a large area."

2,"30 therefore, advances in mapping technology are canopy height model (dchm)."
2,"both of the outputs promising for providing tree inventories in a timely, are overlaid using zonal statistics to extract the tree flexible, accurate, and cost-effective manner (ma et height."
2,"then, the condition of individual trees was al., 2013)."
2,lidar is a remote sensing technology derived from ndvi values.
2,derived parameters that can be used to extract comprehensive details of were overlaid to calculate the hazard rating of the 3d structures.
2,they can penetrate particularly dense individual trees.
2,"the map of the distribution of canopies of vegetation and can be used to gain potential hazardous trees was produced. information on the 3d structure of trees and for trees that have been suppressed (zhang et al., 2015)."
2,"2.1 tree height estimation from lidar data other than pleiades image, there are past studies the lidar data used for this study was obtained on spot-5 which have resolution of 10m with near from pejabat pembangunan infrastruktur & infrared, red and green. 20m resolution of shortwave infostruktur (ppii)."
2,the lidar data covered the infrared band and with panchromatic 2.5m study area of uitm shah alam.
2,data obtained resolution.
2,"the study by (meng et al., 2016) was are in point cloud data and processed in arcgis mainly for mapping of forest health using remotely software."
2,the digital canopy height model sensed image data.
2,it states that this study is (dchm) was generated from the subtraction of conducted because there is difficulty in assessing or digital elevation model (dem) from digital monitoring individual tree health by using field surface model (dsm).
2,individual tree heights observation.
2,"with the improvement of technology, were estimated from dchm."
2,individual trees are remote sensing is the best way to conduct or to delineated by rasterized the point cloud data and practice for this mapping activity. converted the raster data to polygon.
2,zonal statistics is used to extract tree height.
2,methodology the tools extract summary statistics of the raster the overall methodology consists of 4 phases which cells that fall within the polygon.
2,"in this study, is data acquisition, data processing and data analysis maximum values were chosen since the highest and map production as shown in figure 1. tree tip or tree crown are the tree height."
2,the polygon of trees is then converted into points to represent the tree locations.
2,2.2 pleiades data processing the pleiades imagery used in this study was obtained from malaysian space agency (mysa).
2,"this imagery consists of 4 bands which are blue, green, red and near infrared (nir)."
2,"in this study, pleiades was used to assess the condition of the trees via ndvi values."
2,the ndvi values are within -1 to 1 where 1 show tree with great condition.
2,raster calculator tool in arcgis was used to perform ndvi threshold.
2,"the health of the trees was classified using reclassify tools into four classes which are dead or inanimate range from -1 to 0, unhealthy trees range from 0 to 0.33, moderately healthy trees range from 0.33 to 0.66 and very healthy trees range from 0.66 to 1."
2,2.3 identifying the hazardous tree the hazardous trees were classified based on the figure 1: flow of methodology hazard rating which mainly focus on the tree health and tree height as shown in figure 2.
2,the data acquisition stage consists of lidar and hazard rating was derived from the addition of pleiades datasets.
2,"data processing was divided into tree height and tree health using add tools. two phases, the first stage was for lidar data according to usda (2011), the classes of hazard processing that involved rasterizing lidar data for rating are classified into three classes. delineating the individual tree polygons and the individual tree height were derived from digital international journal of geoinformatics, vol.18, no.4 august 2022 issn: 1686-6576 (printed) | issn 2673-0014 (online) | © geoinformatics international"
