1,email: biwal2000@yahoo.com abstract flash floods strike quickly and in most cases without warning.
1,they are usually observed before any warning can be issued and usually persons and property have been affected before the warning reaches them.
1,such are the conditions prevalent in malaysia’s extreme monsoon weather that oc- casionally causes floods and results in the extensive damage to property and sometimes loss of lives.
1,over the years variously hydrological and structural engineering measures have been implemented for flood monitor- ing and forecasting.
1,these measures have only yielded limited success as may be seen in the recurring flood situation.
1,yearly financial and property loss estimates have increased and an estimated cost of over 2.5 billion rm is projected for the year 2004 according to sources from the drainage and irrigation department of malaysia.
1,it has thus become apparent that malay- sia institutes an effective operational flood forecasting to arrest the persist- ing flood problem.
1,"in this paper we will expound on current flood management and fore- casting system being implemented in the country, particularly the klang valley that includes kuala lumpur where there has been tremendous ur- ban growth and development in the last one and half decades."
1,the paper further discusses where current flood management systems have been lack- ing in the absence of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts.
1,"where as hydrodynamic simulations and structural control measures have been em- phasized in many flood management systems in malaysia, the integration"
2,"1358 lawal billa et al of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts have been conspicuously ab- sent, rendering most in-situ flood forecasts and early warnings ineffective in address the flood problem in the country."
2,malaysia is a tropical country that lies along the path of the northeast and southwest monsoon.
2,"although satellite image based nwp have proved useful for the tropical and equatorial regions of the world in flood forecast- ing, they have yet to be applied in malaysia."
2,observations have generally shown heavy cumulonimbus clouds formation and thunderstorms precede the usual heavy monsoon rains that cause floods in the region.
2,this makes quantitative precipitation forecast a must be input to any flood early warn- ing design.
2,numerous empirical studies have determined that cloud top temperatures less that 235k in the tropics are generally expected to produce convective rainfall at the rate of 3mm/hr.
2,in this study we thus investigate monsoon cloud formation that has the propensity to precipitate using noaa-avhrr data for real-time operational flood early warning in ma- laysia.
2,"the avhrr data has been preferred for its relatively high tempo- ral resolution of at most 6/hours, its easy acquisition and cost effectiveness and its ability for automated geometric rectification when compared to geos and gms data."
2,cloud cover and types are processed using cloud indexing and pattern recognition techniques on the avhrr data.
2,the cloud indexing technique was initially developed for noaa but was later also adapted for geo- stationary satellite images.
2,the technique assigns rainfall levels to each cloud type identifies in an image based on the relationship between cold and bright clouds top temperature and the high probability of precipitation.
2,we discuss how visible (vis) and infrared (ir) techniques are applied to bi-spectral cloud classification and rain areas are determined by classifying pixel clusters in the vis/ir histogram.
2,precipitation probability is evalu- ated based on the relationship between cold and brightness temperature of clouds.
2,"the near infrared (nir) and infrared (ir) channels 3, 4, and 5 of the data are processed for temperature and brightness."
2,cold clouds with temperature below 235k threshold value are taken as indication of rain.
2,"rainfall is estimated based on the assumption that every cloud pixel has a constant unit rain-rate of 3mmh-1, which is appropriate for tropical precipi- tation over 2.5o x 2.5o areas around the equator."
2,the paper finally discusses current developments in “nowcasting” that utilizes latest satellite observa- tions together with numerical weather prediction models and how this sys- tem can be adapted to the needs of very short term forecast for flood early warnings in malaysia.
3,"avhrr data for real-time operational flood forecasting in malaysia 1359 1 flood forecasting and the impact of tropical monsoon storms in malaysia every year tropical monsoon storms result in severe flooding and causes enormous economic damage, social disruption, and sometimes loss of lives."
3,"extreme monsoon storms weather phenomena are the most destruc- tive natural disaster afflicting malaysia in respect of the cost, damage to property and the area extent (keizrul and chong, 2002)."
3,accurate fore- casting of floods induced by tropical storm is thus instrumental to the re- duction of flood impacts.
3,"the damages caused are generally associated with wind damage, storm surge, and flooding."
3,"accurate forecasting of these impending floods requires adequate meteorological inputs such as real-time rainfall, quantitative precipitation forecasts (qpf), and the cy- clone landfall location."
3,"hence, close interaction, technological develop- ment and cooperation between forecasting and meteorological technolo- gies are of significant importance to improving flood forecasting and early warning in malaysia."
3,the monsoon storm threat in malaysia is such that flash floods strike quickly and in most cases without warning.
3,flooding is usually observed before any warning can be issued and usually persons and property have been affected before the warning reaches them.
3,variously hydrological models and structural engineering measures have been implemented over the years for flood monitoring and forecasting but have yielded only lim- ited success.
3,"flood forecasting model being implemented have been effec- tive at simulating runoff and basin responses to flood based on synoptic data, however for a flood forecast to be really effective it should provide information about expected rainfall intensity well before it actually occurs."
3,this should increase the emergency response time and provide enough time for contingencies.
3,"in the absence of an effective hydro-meteorological forecasting system, there has been sturdy and yearly increase in cost of damage due to flood."
3,"sources from the drainage and irrigation department of malaysia, estimate the costs of damage due flood for the year 2004 to be over 2.5 billion ringgits."
3,it has thus become apparent that malaysia insti- tutes an effective operational flood forecasting to arrest the recurring flood problem.
3,according to chong (2001) the world meteorological organization (wmo) has helped many countries in improving their national capabilities in flood forecasting and warning under the tropical cyclone program (tcp) in the last decades.
3,the typhoon operation experiment (topex) from 1982 to 1983 was a classical example in which six countries in the typhoon committee area had improved their flood forecasting systems.
4,"1360 lawal billa et al was thought necessary at the time to address the limitations and problems affecting the effectiveness of the flood forecasting and early warning sys- tems in its model selection, model calibration and real-time operation of flood forecasting models."
4,experts have prioritized research areas of opera- tional flood forecasting to be in the development of improved meteoro- logical inputs and hydrological considerations.
4,"2 avhrr data for meteorological and precipitation monitoring the availability of data from meteorological satellites such as polar orbit- ing noaa series and geostationary satellites ( gms, meteosat, goes) for more than 30 years have made them the most suitable and cur- rently the most commonly used data set in the monitoring and collection of clouds information."
4,"meteorological satellites provide excellent aerial cov- erage with regard to the observation of many cloud variables and other useful information on indirect and vertically integrated quantities, like ra- diance at the top of the atmosphere, rather than direct measurements of model variables."
4,"the information gathered contributes to the basic re- search and better understanding of the earth's radiation budget, hydrologi- cal cycle and of the role of clouds in both systems."
4,a survey conducted by cloudmap2 (accessed 15/8/04) show the use of geostationary meteosat (79%) dominates the use of polar orbiting noaa satellite (21%) worldwide.
4,"the situation is however opposite in high latitude countries such as the scandinavian countries, where the oblique view angle of meteosat makes it on suitable."
4,noaa is most used due to its temporal coverage of these areas.
4,the noaa-avhrr im- ages come from a series of polar orbiting environmental satellite operated by the united states.
4,they have on board the advance very high resolu- tion radiometer (avhrr) and are the most wildly use meteorological and regional vegetation monitoring around the world.
4,3 avhrr data for real-time flood forecasting in malaysia noaa avhrr satellite data in local area coverage (lac) has been in- vestigated for its meteorological application in monsoon area of the tropi- cal regions of the world such as malaysia and also for its appropriateness in providing better understanding into rain bearing tropical clouds.
5,"avhrr data for real-time operational flood forecasting in malaysia 1361 avhrr data is preferred because of its repeated coverage and relatively high temporal resolution of at most 6/hr daily, easy acquisition, cost effec- tiveness and it has the ability for automated geometric rectification when compared to geos and gms data."
5,"avhrr data has relatively high reso- lution data with average ifov of 1.3 miliradians and gfov of about 1.1km at nadir, 6+ km at the edge of the scan (levizzani et al.2002)."
5,another motivation for using avhrr in malaysia is the use of its five- channel multi-spectral observations for the purpose of discriminating tropical storm cloud properties not derivable from the primary three- channel in geostationary satellite data.
5,the challenge is to utilize the latest observations of noaa satellite images of monsoon cloud formation to- gether with suitable hydro-meteorological models to improve very short forecasts (nowcasting).
5,"karlsson et al (1999), defined nowcasting as flood forecasting in the approximate range 0-9 hours from observation time."
5,"satellite-based information provided by the polar-orbital meteorologi- cal satellite series (noaa), in the field of meteorological and climatologi- cal application are carried out to improve real-time operational monitor- ing of the atmosphere and hydrological environment, selection of meteorological and hydrological forecasting over short, medium and long range, as well as warning of dangerous hydro-meteorological phenomena (karlsson,1999)."
5,"this understanding should lead to improved parameteri- zation of clouds in operation weather forecasting models based on research focuses in: x cloud analysis and classification x cloud top temperature (ctt) and cloud top height (cth) x cloud mask x surface albedo maps x cloud motion derived winds x integration of remotely sensed information in meteorological numerical forecasting models 4 processing of avhrr data for rainfall intensity the need for satellite- estimated precipitation arises from non dependable, poorly maintained and spatially distributed synoptic rainfall data, some as a result of inaccessible dense tropical rainforest and most importantly the need for rain fall estimates before the rain had actually fallen."
5,"empirical methods have determined that cloud top temperatures less than 235k in the tropics are generally expected to produce stratiform rainfall at the rate of 1,5mm/half hour (arkin and meisner, 1987)."
5,avhrr data provides the
6,1362 lawal billa et al means of investigating and measuring cloud parameter from monsoon cloud formation that are most prevalent in malaysia.
6,multi-spectral techniques based on the relationship between cold and brightness temperature of clouds are used to evaluate precipitation prob- ability in avhrr data.
6,"the mir and ir channels 3, 4, and 5 of the data are processed for temperature and brightness (tb)."
6,"a processed tb data, typically highlights the top of the atmosphere brightness temperature for different observed features, cold clouds are high clouds and where cloud tb falls below 235k they are identified as cumulonimbus cloud with a high probability to precipitate (levizzani et al.2002) lower probabilities are as- sociated to warm but bright stratus cloud and thin cirrus cloud that are cold but dull."
6,according the arkin (1979) cold clouds with temperature below 235k threshold value are indicative of rain.
6,"rainfall is estimated based on the as- sumption that every cloud pixel has a constant unit rain-rate of 3mmh-1, which is appropriate for tropical precipitation over 2.5o x 2.5o areas around the equator."
6,based on storm tracing assumptions coupled with estimation techniques cloud clusters below some temperature thresholds have high probability of rainfall.
6,information on the radiance temperature on top of clouds in thermal infrared band can be empirically calculated into average rainfall intensity by mean of various techniques.
6,"these techniques have been detailed in (griffith et al., 1978; adler and negri, 1988)."
6,total cold cloud cover and the portion of the catchment covered by cloud determines rainfall intensity.
6,5 algorithm for processing of avhrr data for rainfall intensity an algorithm has been developed to enhance and streamline the processing of avhrr data for real-time tropical monsoon weather monitoring to im- prove quantitative precipitation forecast as input to hydrological model for flood early warning.
6,the algorithm combines processing techniques such as the cloud indexing that assigns rain-rates to individual cloud type identi- fied in the satellite imagery as described by arkin (1979) and the cloud model method developed by gruber (1973).
6,the algorithm is best illus- trated in the flow chart (fig 1).

7,"the processing of the entire scene of the image involves radiometric calibration, where the visible and near in- frared channels are calibrated in radiance or reflectance and the thermal ir channels in brightness temperatures."
7,"other processing includes automatic geometric correction and rectification of the image, atmospheric correction and cloud detection."

9,it uses the mid infrared channel 3 and the thermal channel 4 and 5 to process the entire scene for brightness temperature (fig. 4) and channels 1 and 2 for albedo.
9,"the visible channels measure the cloud thickness and offer infor- mation about albedo, while the infrared channels measure the temperature of the cloud and offer information about thermal radiation emitted by the land and cloud top."
9,low high fig.
9,"brightness temperature (tb in k) image is further processed by performing a classification to determine cloud type, fraction and height."
9,"through this parameterization of clouds clusters, it will be possible to classify them into different precipitation level (karlsson et al, 1999)."
9,figure 5 shows high cloud cluster classifica- tion from which precipitation bearing clouds have been delineated (fig.6).
9,"high precipitation cloud clusters may also be detected by means of an it- erative numerical process that tests the mass, dimension and the compact- ness of each identified structure against the established threshold parame- ter (o’sullivan et al, 1990)."
9,the screening for cirrus non-precipitation cloud is based on an established empirical discrimination of thin cirrus

10,where the local min- ima in the ir tb are sought and screened to eliminate thin non- precipitating cirrus.
10,high cloud pixels fig.5.
10,classification and delineation of high cloud operational cloud top temperature (ctt) and maps are produced using avhrr data calibrated in temperature.
10,the ctt is created from channel 4 and 5 using a threshold method where threshold values are chosen inter- actively by examining the histogram of the value from the look up table (lut) of the image processing software.
10,the multispectral colored im- agery is enhanced to visualized cloud top temperature (fig.7).
10,the value of temperature less than 235k is displayed on a color from red to blue as shown in the temperature map presented in figure 4.
10,the rain parameters of 3-12 mmh-1 depending on monsoon rainfall intensity are finally as- signed based on the 1-d cloud model that calculates maximum rain-rate as a function of maximum cloud height and minimum cloud model tempera- ture at a threshold level of 235k.

11,"screening of cirrus non-precipitating clouds since avhrr data is received well in advance of rainfall and has a high temporal resolution of at least five scene coverages a day, cloud in- formation is thus processed pre real-time and can subsequently be moni- tored regularly."
11,processed rainfall intensity is projected over catchment area or river basin in malaysia depending on the cloud fraction and to- gether with an integrated gis for hydrological data processing and suitable and well calibrated hydrodynamic model for rainfall runoff and flood simulation to determine areas likely to be inundated.

12,high rainfall intensity with tb below 235k 6 conclusion monsoon flood by all accounts is the most significant disaster affecting malaysia in terms of costs and extent of damage.
12,the need for improved hydro-meteorological models for real – time forecasting and early warning has been discussed in this paper in the light of an algorithm developed to improve the modeling of rainfall intensity and short term forecast using noaa- avhrr data.
12,multi-spectral avhrr data is excellent for the observation and modeling of many cloud variables.
12,cloud top brightness temperature is related to precipitation and cloud clusters with tb below the threshold of 235k are indicative of impending rainfall.
12,the intensity of rainfall is shown to be depending on how low the tb is for the cloud clusters.
12,"through a supervised classification and tb process- ing, high clouds have been identified and thin cirrus non-precipitating cloud eliminated."
12,rain intensity of 3-12 mmh-1 are assigned to the 1-d cloud model to calculates maximum rain-rate as a function of maximum cloud height and minimum cloud model temperature at a threshold level of
13,avhrr data for real-time operational flood forecasting in malaysia 1369 235k.
13,good and encouraging results have been observed as they provide a good aerial coverage that delineates areas likely to receive intense rainfall on a regional scale.
13,the computed rainfall may however in most cases not have the same accuracy of the conventional observations.
13,"avhrr data is received in real-time and has a high temporal resolu- tion thus the derive cloud information reveals many application in the monitoring of top of the cloud temperature, cloud fraction and clouds type that are important for hydro-meteorological studies with consequent flood information as the determination of potential flood vulnerable river catch- ment area."
13,"in malaysia where the continuous devastation of monsoon floods has become a great cause for concern, the question is how current flood forecasting system may be improved to provide information of im- pending flood and the likely areas to be affected well before it actually rains."
13,the concern of using satellite-based information provided by the po- lar–orbiting meteorological satellite (noaa) is based on its suitable char- acteristics as has been discussed and most importantly its operational ap- plicability in hydro-meteorological and climatologically short term forecast.
