1,"mediter- ranean landscapes, due to some peculiar characteristics, such as fragility of soils, steep slopes, and rainfall distribution during the year, are particularly subject to this phenomenon, with severe and complex issues for agricultural production and biodiversity protection."

2,"among the different threats contributing to soil degra- dation, erosion probably represents the major process worldwide [3] and has been listed as one of the eight soil threats included in the european soil thematic strategy [4]."
2,soil erosion is a natural phenomenon consisting mainly of water erosion whose action is due to rain and water flow on the earth’s surface [5].
2,"climate change is expected to drive an ever more irregular hydrologic cycle and more frequent torrential rainfall patterns [6], thus, increasing the intensity of water erosion phenomena and accelerating erosion processes in the near future [7]."
2,"in addition, erosion has been accelerated by anthropic activities through deforestation, overgrazing, inappropriate agricultural practices, and construction activities [8] and this phenomenon becomes unsustainable when the loss of soil exceeds its formation rate."
2,"conventionally, the sustainability limit in europe has bee indicated to be a loss of one ton per hectare per year, considered effectively irreversible for a period of 50–100 years [9]."
2,soil erosion is a severe environmental and economic problem in several european countries.
2,the latest estimates produced by the joint research centre (jrc) of the european commission reported that 12 million hectares of agricultural areas in eu suffer from severe erosion and the annual cost in terms of agricultural productivity is around eur 1.25 billion with an overall loss in gdp (gross domestic product) of about eur 155 million [10].
2,"in europe, mediterranean countries exhibit the worst conditions as they are often subject to prolonged dry periods followed by heavy erosive rains which fall on steep slopes characterized by fragile soils [11]."
2,"in some of these areas, erosion has reached a stage of irreversibility with places where the phenomenon has practically ceased because there is no more soil left [9]."
2,"as a paradigmatic example of a mediterranean country, italy seems to have paid the ultimate price based on the recent estimates provided by panagos et al. [10], with an annual loss of eur 619 million and about 33% of its total agricultural area affected by severe erosion [12]."
2,"although agriculture is the economic sector most impacted by erosion, its general effects on biodiversity can be equally dramatic [13]."
2,italy encompasses different biogeographies and climates [14] and hosts the highest number and density of animal and plant species within the european union.
2,this biodiversity can be seriously affected by soil erosion [15] since heavy losses of soil can damage the overall capacity to host safe ecosystems and protected species [16].
2,"since the 1930s, soil scientists have developed models to calculate soil losses from fields, hillslopes, or watersheds [17]."
2,"to be useful for decision-makers, soil erosion models must use simple data, must consider spatial and temporal variability in hydrological and soil erosion processes, and must be applicable to a variety of regions with minimum calibration [18]."
2,"according to an extensive inventory conducted by borrelli et al. [19], 435 distinct erosion models and model variants for the evaluation of potential soil loss at different spatial and temporal scales have been identified and about 85% of them have addressed soil erosion by water."
2,"among them, the universal soil loss equation (usle) is the most widely used and accepted empirical model, both in its original form [17] and in its revised version (r)usle [20]."
2,"while the usle is mainly designed for estimations in agricultural plots, the rusle equations have been improved for their application in watersheds [21]."
2,"the rusle equations compute average annual soil erosion by multiplying several factors together: rainfall factor (r), soil erodibility factor (k), slope length and steepness topographical (ls) factor, cover management factor (c), and support practice factor (p)."
2,"since its first applications in agricultural areas, researchers have understood the high potential of this model for large scale assessments and broader policy needs, beyond the traditional support to farmers."
2,"in a more general research framework, the rusle model is now a widely accepted starting point for analysis but generally it cannot be used in its original form, mainly due to its strict local scale character and its stringent data demands (e.g., corine)."
3,"land 2022, 11, 1010 3 of 25 one of the primary advantages of the rusle model is the possibility to adapt the model to other geo-environmental and socioeconomic contexts [22] even if limited by a scarcity of data [23], thanks to a large amount of supporting literature [24]."
3,"secondly, this model is particularly suitable for capitalizing on the enormous potential that geospatial technologies have shown, accompanied by the ever-growing availability of high-resolution data [25,26] that improve the accuracy of the estimates of soil erosion rates over large areas [27]."
3,"here, we present work on a multi-decadal assessment (1994–2021) of soil erosion in basilicata (southern italy), a region where contrasting local climates and ecosystems compose a mosaic that effectively represents the biogeographical complexity of mediter- ranean italy."
3,"climate change acceleration, especially the increase in frequency and intensity of climate extremes, and land use/land cover change rates imply that valuable soil loss estimates should strictly follow changing environmental scenarios."
3,our aim was to ex- plore the use of the rusle model to properly frame soil loss in a dynamic context that could account for climate variability/change and land cover evolution.
3,"due to the highly fragmented character of the local land cover mosaics, moderate/high resolution data were needed to account for the land cover spatial variability."
3,"unfortunately, reliable land cover maps at high resolution and updated frequently were not available."
3,"we propose, instead, the use of a simple high resolution vegetation index as a proxy for land use/land cover."
3,"the availability of sufficiently continuous data is crucial to obtain a dynamic picture of land use/land cover in heterogeneous fragmented areas, useful for monitoring long-term changes with the desired sampling frequency."
3,"such data can be an added value in any framework where the landscape evolution is paramount, such as soil loss assessments."
3,"therefore, we used satellite landsat data (30 m) to estimate the cover management impact and chirps (and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations) data to include areas where the distribution of meteorological stations was scarce and irregular."
3,"we considered a temporal period of about 30 years, which accounted for information of climatic value, and split it in three periods to account for interdecadal climate variability around average conditions."
3,the use of remote data within a diachronic analysis makes our approach useful to evaluate the long-term sustainability of land uses and their compatibility with erosion control and soil maintenance with a high level of local detail.
3,"methods the analysis, in this study, aims to reconstruct trajectories of soil loss variability through the estimation of soil erosion for four dates in the period 1994–2021."
3,"such repeated assessments enabled us to account for the impact of spatial-temporal patterns in land cover change and its management, as well as for possible changes in the regularity of rainfall regimes (amount and seasonal distribution of rainfalls)."
3,"the usle/rusle equations have often been used to estimate soil erosion for large areas, up to the country level [28]."
3,"the rusle equation computes the average annual soil erosion by multiplying several factors together: a = r·k · ls·c · p, (1)   where a is the mean soil loss per year t ha−1 y−1 , r is the rainfall erosivity factor     mj mm ha−1 h−1 y−1 , k is the soil-erodibility factor t h mj−1 mm−1 , ls is the com- bined slope length (l) and slope steepness (s) factor (non-dimensional), c is the cover management factor (non-dimensional), and p is the erosion control practice factor (non- dimensional)."
3,"since it is a multiplier, if one factor tends toward zero, erosion will tend toward zero."
3,the estimation procedures adopted for this study are shown in the following paragraphs for each parameter.
3,"further details on the effects of the rusle parameters on erosion prediction are discussed in [20,29]."
4,"land 2022, 11, 1010 4 of 25 2.1."
4,rainfall erosivity factor (r) the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is a key factor in soil erosion.
4,fournier [30] proposed an indicator of rainfall aggressiveness where the maximum monthly rainfalls (mm) were used.
4,"since the fournier’s index does not consider the monthly rainfall distri- bution during the year, it does not always increase when the number of erosive rainfalls in the year increases."
4,"in order to avoid this drawback, arnoldus [31] proposed the modi- fied fournier index (mfi) that represents the ratio between average monthly rainfall and average annual rainfall: 2 1 n 12 pij mfi = ∑ ∑ n j=1 i=1 pj , (2) where pij is the monthly rainfall, namely the total amount of precipitation in the i-th month of the j-th year; pj is the annual rainfall for the j-th year; and n is the total number of years used in the estimation."
4,"in this study, the modified fournier index (mfi) was adopted to estimate the r factor with the approach suggested by ferro et al. [32] and used by aiello et al. [33] in two hydrographic basins within the same basilicata region: r = 0.6120 · mfi 1.56 (3) the good performance of mfi in the estimation of rainfall erosivity has been shown for data records of five or more years, for example, hernando et al."
4,[34]).
4,we decided on a 10-year time series length as a trade-off between the need for robust statistics and temporal sampling that can reveal possible effects of long-term climate variability.
4,"slope length and slope steepness factor ls the effects of topography and hydrology on erosion rates can be estimated using the non-dimensional factor ls, given by the product of the slope length l and the slope steepness s factors."
4,"areas with steep slopes tend to be more susceptible to erosion than flat areas, and generally, soil erosion increases with increasing slope length."
4,"the extraction of the ls factor is a key issue, since it is the most sensitive parameter of the (r)usle model in soil loss predictions [35]."
4,"the procedure of obtaining the l and s factors was originally done manually [17,20,36], therefore, in the 1980s, their implementa- tion at the watershed scale was unfeasible because their variation was difficult to represent."
4,"with the advent of gis, erosion models started to adopt a spatial representation of erosion processes and features."
4,"according to desmet and govers [37], in a real two-dimensional situation, overland flow and the resulting soil loss do not really depend on the distance to the divide or upslope border of the field, but on the unit contributing areat, a, i.e., the upslope drainage area per unit of contour length."
4,"thus, several procedures, often based on digital elevation models (dems), have been developed in the last 25 years to substitute the slope-length factor with the unit contributing area (see e.g., [36–40])."
4,"in this work, the ls factor was computed in matlab using the equation proposed by moore and burch [40], moore and wilson [36], and moore et al. [41]:  m  sin β n  as ls = × ×z (4) a0 b0 where: - as is flow path length expressed as the unit contributing area (meters); - a0 = 22.13 m and b0 = sin (5.143◦ ) = 0.0896 are, respectively, the length and slope of the standard usle plot [36]; - β is slope angle in radian (i.e., β = 3.14* θ/180, where θ is the slope angle in degree); - z is defined as rilling factor, which is used to modify the length slope factor and is developed from the theory of unit stream power, which is usually either 1 or 1.4 (e.g., [9]), and set as 1 in the present work;"
5,"land 2022, 11, 1010 5 of 25 - m and n are physical coefficients generally set as m = 0.4 and n = 1.3 (e.g., [40,42–44])."
5,"the required dem derivatives (specifically the local slope angle (β), the flow direc- tion, and flow accumulation) were computed using topotoolbox [45], a matlab-based software for the topographic analysis of dems."
5,"specifically, the following algorithms were used: - slope algorithm, the trigonometrical maximum downward gradient using an 8- connected neighbourhood [45]; - flow direction algorithm, the deterministic infinity algorithm (d∞) by tarboton [39] where the flow direction is partitioned among multiple downslope neighbors deter- mined following the steepest descent and is represented as a continuous quantity between 0 and 2π in direction."
5,"such an algorithm was selected to avoid the widely recognized problem of the single flow direction algorithm (d8) of unrealistically re- stricting flow pathways to the multiples of 45◦ , and also to circumvent the unrealistic dispersion introduced by the multiple flow direction algorithm (mfd) [21]."
5,"cover management factor, c among the rusle elements, the ls and c factors have the greatest impact on model- ing soil loss [46], thus, improving the accuracy in the estimate of these factors is essential."
5,"the c factor accounts for typology and density of the vegetation cover, since this is a limiting element for erosive processes by reducing the rain impact on soil surface [47]."
5,it represents a dynamic component of the rusle model incorporating changes in land cover and management practices [48].
5,"in its original form, the c factor ranged between 0 and 1 and was typically retrieved from in situ surveys."
5,"recently, the advent of a large amount of geospatial data relying mainly on remote sensing platforms, has led to an increasing adoption of simplified forms of the c factor grounded in land cover classifications and vegetation indexes (see e.g., [49])."
5,"the use of land cover maps could introduce errors in highly heterogeneous areas because, generally, they are not able to pick up spatial details of the study area, especially if we want to obtain high resolution soil loss maps."
5,we opted to use a vegetation index to estimate c from landsat (30 m) data to base our assessment on direct and updated observa- tions.
5,"specifically, we chose the soil-adjusted vegetation index (savi), as proxy for canopy cover, see [50], since it has been proven to be strongly correlated with c factor as compared with other vegetation indices [51]."
5,"in particular, the savi has been demonstrated to be able to appropriately account for sparsely vegetated areas where, generally, the well-known normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) is highly variable [52]."
5,"following [53], we estimated the c factor as: c = − a· savi + 1 (5) where c is the cover management factor, a = 1.18, and savi is obtained by the follow- ing equation: [(nir − red)·(1 + l)] savi = (6) (nir + red + l) where l is an adjustment length, usually assumed to be 0.5; nir and red are the reflectance values obtained in the near-infrared and red-visible bands, respectively."
5,"the use of vegetation indices to estimate annual variables is not straightforward because of the presence of snow and clouds that limit optical land observations, especially in winter and autumn."
5,"here, we explored the use of a single monthly value (may), because, in this period, all crops in basilicata are in the growing season, the values of vegetation indices obtained from natural covers are clearly distinguishable from those characteristics of the agricultural ones, and the values effectively separate different phenologies."
5,"in addition, this is the most stable month if evaluated on interannual scales [54] and we wanted to avoid average values which could be distorted by land management practices such as crop rotation."
5,the savi value in may appears therefore a good candidate to follow the long-term dynamics of land use/land cover.

6,"soil-erodibility factor, k the k factor expresses the intrinsic susceptibility of soil to erosion as a function of its properties, such as organic matter content, grain size, permeability, structural integrity, and cohesiveness."
6,"in this work over the basilicata region, we decided to exploit the high- resolution soil erodibility map produced by the jrc of the european soil data centre (esdac) (see [55])."
6,this dataset consists of a 500 m resolution k factor map harmonized for the 28 european union member states.
6,"k was calculated using the nomograph of wischmeier and smith [17] on about 20,000 points of the land use/cover area frame survey (lucas) topsoil data [56]."
6,these lucas point estimates were then interpolated using a cubist regression model to produce the soil erodibility dataset at 500 m resolution.
6,"then, it was validated against local/regional/national studies found in the literature with very good results."
6,a detailed description of the dataset and the application in europe is described in [55].
6,it is freely provided by the jrc for research purposes both with the incorporation or not of the surface stone cover.
6,"in this regard, the dataset adopted in the present study does not consider the stoniness and its protective effect against soil erosion."
6,"erosion control practice factor, p the p factor represents the contribution of anti-erosion practices on soil loss, and is a dimensionless parameter ranging between 0 and 1."
6,"the cultivation practices that help in reducing erosion contemplated in the rusle model are terracing, contouring (cultivation according to topography contour lines), and strip cropping."
6,"among the rusle input factors, values for the p factor are considered to be the most uncertain and the effects of support practices on soil erosion reduction by water are difficult to estimate especially for large areas."
6,"in this study, to take into consideration the effects of different support practices on soil erosion redcution, the p factor dataset produced by the jrc of the esdac was adopted [57]."
6,"this p factor was modeled for the european union taking into consideration contour farming, maintenance of stone walls, and grass margins."
6,it was based on consideration of the latest agro-environmental policies of the common agricultural policy and application of the rules set by the individual member states for contour farming over a certain slope.
6,"in addition, the impact of conservation practices such as stone walls and grass margins was modeled using more than 226,000 observations from the lucas carried out in 2012 in the european union."
6,"a detailed description of the p factor dataset, its production process, and it application in europe can be found in the works of panagos et al."
6,"[48,57]."
6,"procedure for comparison with other local studies to be confident in the values of soil loss by water, we implemented a detailed survey of studies that had focused on the study region, starting from a comprehensive review by borelli et al."
6,"for this purpose, the studies had to contain information on the soil loss values linked to a specific area and a reference period jointly with details on the implemented procedure."
6,"for basin-scale studies, the catchment areas at different orders were downloaded in shape format from the national environmental information system network (sinanet) of the italian institute for environmental protection and research (ispra) (additional details are provided in section 3.2 dataset)."
6,"for studies based on sediment deposits in dams, the drainage area that flowed into the dam was identified by combining different catchment orders."
6,"for regional-scale studies with the availability of soil loss maps, the data were acquired and reprojected in utm wgs84 to be jointly analyzed with our results."
6,"in particular, we downloaded the maps of soil loss by water erosion at 100 m resolution available for 2010 and 2016 from the jrc of the esdac [55,58]."

7,"study area basilicata is one of 20 regions in italy (the administrative subdivision corresponding to the european nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (nuts2) with a population of about 545,000 inhabitants, according to the italian national institute of statistics (istat) population census of 2020 scattered over a territory of 10,073 km2 (figure 1a)."
7,"land cover appears very heterogeneous (figure 1b), mostly reflecting orography (figure 1c)."
7,"natural areas characterize high-elevation zones of the apennine chain where different forest populations dominate, whose ecological value has led to the establishment of several protected areas, including the pollino massif and the appennino lucano val d’agri lagonegrese national park."
7,"the north-eastern part of the region bordering apulia (bradano basin) is devoted to agriculture (cereals are the prevalent crop) and, in the volcanogenic basin of the vulture, vineyards and olive groves give the landscape its distinctive mediterranean appearance."
7,"arable lands are the main cover also in the central- eastern zone (matera hills), characterized by the so-called calanchi, i.e., badlands with bare clay hills strongly affected by erosional processes [59]."
7,"the metaponto plain, a strip of land overlooking the ionian sea, is the core of the specialized agriculture of basilicata (fruit trees and orchards, see [60]) where salinization phenomena have threaten groundwater quality and soil productivity [61,62]."
7,"the peculiarity of basilicata is the coexistence of the different and, in some ways, contrasting climates it encompasses: the temperate climates (csa and csb), the steppic climate (bsk), and the mediterranean mountain climates (dsb and dsb) characterizing some isolated mountainous areas of the apennine chain [63]."
7,basilicata shows a pronounced vulnerability to land degradation [64] similar to that of most italian landscapes and mediterranean countries [65–68].
7,"this proneness originates from an intrinsic weakness of key environmental parameters: soils are often thin and with a scarce presence of organic matter [69], while vegetation appears sparse and intermixed with barren areas in many zones [70,71]."
7,"in certain areas, climate is the determining factor that amplifies the vulnerability to land degradation [14,72], further exacerbated by the ascertained and increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme events (see e.g., [73,74])."
7,"lastly, in recent years, human activites have deeply modified landscape patterns, accelerating land degradation phenomena through improper land management [75]; the building of dams, barrages, industrial poles, and tourism facilities [76,77]; and the aban- donment of marginal areas [78]."
7,"in particular, the cultivation of unsuitable areas fuelled, in some cases, by the common agricultural policy (cap) (see [79]), since 1992 (macsharry reform), and the persistent adoption of conventional agricultural techniques providing higher revenues as compared with conservative practices represent the major causes of soil degradation [80]."
7,"alongside this issue, the progressive depopulation recorded in the last two decades has produced widespread phenomena of land abandonment in inner areas, especially in the presence of agriculture founded on low-profitability crops (cereals and traditional olive groves, see, for example, [81])."

20,"discussion the possibility to adapt the rusle model to specific territories and scales and also with limited data availability has spurred numerous authors to test different approaches to derive the basilar factors for its implementation [19,22–24]."
20,"in this work, we evaluated the usefulness of satellite data (landsat imagery for c factor and chirps time series for r factor) to estimate soil erosion by water at the regional level."
20,"generally, the c factor based on satellite data is derived by classifying the imagery to obtain land use/land cover at spatial resolution higher than the available land cover maps or with different temporal sampling (e.g., corine clc) [26,89,96]."
20,"the results obtained from the comparison with the esdac maps (mean differences of about 10%) that are based on standard computation of c factor with literature tables for arable lands [58], support the hypothesis of other works for estimating the c factor directly from satellite-based vegetation indices [49,51,53]."
20,"one of the relevant points for this choice is the selection of a date representative for the land cover present in the investigated area [33,51]."
20,"in our application, may was selected to take into account the presence of very arable crops just before harvesting in order to consider their presence in the erosion estimation."
20,"the use of spatially distributed rainfall data from the chirps time series allowed us to achieve a detailed estimation of r factors also in areas where, generally, pluviometric stations are very scarce, such as mountains, and the standard kriging approaches may not produce representative results [51,89,97]."
20,"even when the stations are present, the availability of the required hourly data is not assured and the monthly data are used with mfi or extended mfi indices [33,97], making the adoption of chirps data easier."
20,"in general, our results overestimated water erosion both at the local and regional scale; higher differences (about 16%) were related to agricultural coverages with a significant presence of natural vegetation areas [49]."
20,"this discrepancy was even greater in purely natu- ral areas, such as shrubs and forests, and was in line with the results of gianinetto et al. [25] who used satellite data for the estimation of the parameter c and found an overestimation of soil loss in forested areas."
20,"apart from the differences among the covers, the homogeneous overestimation we obtained seemed to be more linked to the ls factor."
20,"the comparison at the local scale seems to support such an hypothesis (range of overestimation with local application of the rusle model 2.5–7.0 t ha−1 y−1 ) since it highlights that the standard rusle model overestimates the gross erosion with respect to the usped, whereas the rusle3d [38] limits such overestimation [33,96]."
20,"conclusions soil, as a non-renewable resource sustaining life on earth’s surface, must be protected from natural disturbance factors (wind, rainfall, heatwaves, etc.) and improper tillage practices that can make it unproductive."
20,erosion is identified as a major threat to soil con-
21,"land 2022, 11, 1010 21 of 25 servation, especially in mediterranean regions with intrinsic environmental vulnerabilities and a long history of man-made transformations."
21,"empirical-based modeling approaches, such as the rusle model, have achieved the first assessments of the most erosion-sensitive sites over large areas."
21,"in this work, we adopted the rusle equation by using various sources of data encompassing european databases, topographic information, and time series of satellite observations to estimate potential soil erosion losses of basilicata (southern italy) over the time span 1994–2021."
21,the spatial distribution of soil loss in basilicata during this period does not show dramatic changes.
21,"lower values of erosion are generally recorded in 2021, with the exception of some confined areas (lagonegrese and agri valley) showing the reverse pattern."
21,the general greening observed within the region in recent years is a key process to explain the reduction in soil loss amounts.
21,"this is due to a combination of the reclamation process fuelled by cap and started in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which favored durum wheat cultivation in bushy and barren lands, and the rewilding of areas within forests and in their surrounding areas that have contributed to reduce the satellite savi value and the c factor (land management)."
21,"this result puts into evidence the utility of our approach for estimating the role of land use/land cover and related management, which exploits satellite data rather than land cover classifications."
21,"indeed, very local but diffused reclamation processes are generally not picked up by clc maps, whereas vegetation indices capture them, enabling us to estimate the impact of very local scale interventions on soil loss."
21,the spatial-temporal trajectories enhanced by the intermediate estimations show slight fluctuations in erosion losses due mostly to rainfall variability.
21,"especially in mountainous areas falling in the dsa köppen-geiger zones, the r factor shows an evident variability with the net local increase phenomena of local rainfall erosivity."
21,these areas are hardly accessible and generally unsuited for agriculture.
21,"here, soil loss rates are mainly expected to be driven by climate variability and changes that can modify rainfall regimes and extreme events."
21,"differently, in the other climate zones that are warmer, drier, and generally characterized by smoother morphologies, land management plays a major role in soil conservation trajectories."
21,pixel-based and municipal maps of erosion losses provide options to policymakers for efficiently managing soil issues for prioritization of areas having different pedo-climatic and socioeconomic features.
21,"this suggests the establishment of regional (local) strategies to rebalance agricultural and forestry land uses (e.g., favoring arboriculture instead of arable land, promoting afforestation with native species in barren or sparsely vegetated areas, and encouraging agriculture in areas with demographic decline) and to improve the p factor (linked to the adoption of conservative agricultural practices) to match the new ways established by europe towards environmental sustainability."
21,"the added value of remote sensing data, representing the core of our work, consists in the potential to perform multitemporal analyses of observational data, and thereby to document spatio-temporal patterns for assessing the effects of past and recent policies."
21,"the recent validated chirps data, which integrate ground and remote observations, directly provide spatial data, thus, limiting the arbitrariness in the spatial interpolation of data from ground stations performed by single researchers that could lead to different conclusions."
21,"the long-term chirps and landsat datasets, which both assure diachronic (multidecadal) analysis, make estimates more robust and reliable with respect to the use of standard databases, often produced to have global applicability."
21,remote data provide a dynamic picture of land use/land cover that impacts the spatial/temporal variability of soil loss.
21,"in turn, such diachronic assessments provide new insight into the sustainability of land use/land cover in climate changing scenarios at a high level of detail.starting from this baseline, this research could act as a roadmap for further studies on soil loss estimation in biogeographically complex areas such as basilicata by using higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution datasets (sentinel-2 and prisma) to assist policymakers in soil and land management."
