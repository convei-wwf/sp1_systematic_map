1,"chapter 9 challenges and opportunities for cost-effective use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture chris cavalaris department of agriculture crop production and rural development, university of thessaly, volos, greece introduction unmanned aerial systems (uass), or simpler drones, evolve to a core element of agriculture 4.0 supporting key aspects for smart agriculture applications, such as crop trait monitoring and precise product applications (aslan et al., 2022)."
1,"their worldwide use is growing exponentially, reveal- ing a broadscale knowledge of their benefits and perspectives for the whole agricultural sector."
1,"the provision of objective, timely and high throughput information may assist the effective decision making for critical field operations, including fertilization, irrigation, crop protection, and many more (lezoche et al., 2020)."
1,"furthermore, their introduction into field tasks by substituting conventional machines reveal their integra- tion in the entire farm life cycle (kim et al., 2019)."
1,"their contribution to the adaptation of crop production to climate change and to the reduction of the environmental impact of the agricultural practices is expected to be essential (pádua et al., 2019; chivasa et al., 2020)."
1,a characteristic paradigm for the wide acceptance of drones in agricul- ture is the case of the agricultural sector of china.
1,"at the end of 2019, china industry developed more than 170 different types of plant protec- tion uass and more than 55,000 uass were operating in an area that exceeded 56.67 million ha."
1,"five thousand (5000) uass were performing field sprayings only at the region of xinjiang, the largest cotton- production region in the country comprising of 1.33 million ha (wang et al., 2022)."
1,"in europe, over 150,000 drones are expected to operate in farms by 2035 performing field scouting and material applications ( joint undertaking, 2016)."

2,"198 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture the rate of adoption and spreading of drones in agriculture will largely depend from complementing some organizational, social, and technical chal- lenges, like cost of use and ownership, reliability and confidentiality, heteroge- neity of the demands, interoperability, data handling and analyzing dynamics, technical skills disposal, and societal acceptance (lezoche et al., 2020)."
2,the cost of using drones and the expected economic benefits will be one of the most crucial aspects and will depend on drones’ capabilities and technical evolution.
2,"the first multirotor uas was built more than a hundred years ago, but its high cost and poor inherent stability and con- trol hinted its utility until the recent advances in electronic flight control systems that have enabled the inexpensive use of small drones in a variety of civil and agricultural applications (zhu et al., 2020)."
2,"nevertheless agri- cultural uass face still numerous technical limitations, such as payload capacity, endurance, communication stability, and security (kim et al., 2019; elmeseiry et al., 2021)."
2,the performance of a particular task executed by a uas depends on the flight speed and ground effective width of the operation.
2,the ground effective width refers to the perpendicular to the direction of travel regarding the performed task.
2,it is usually equal to the distance between two adjacent field passes when a task is performed in parallel lines.
2,"there are, however, many limitations compromising the speed and the effective width of the operations."
2,"for instance, while performing field spraying the flight speed is limited by the amount of the necessary spray dose as also the desired coverage."
2,"increased speeds also increase the risks of spray drift (ahmad et al., 2020)."
2,limitations in speed may occur even when per- forming field scouting operations for remote sensing data collection.
2,"the timelapse for image capture and storing of the sensor as well as the requirements for forward overlapping to build the structure from motion models limits the distance intervals between two consequent image cap- tures possessing corresponding limitations on flying speeds (hardin and jensen, 2011)."
2,"the effective width during remote sensing may be high, especially when scouting from a high altitude, but limitations in side- overlapping and reduction in image resolution with the increase of height may also induce restrictions in the operating performance of the drone."
2,"user controllable speeds for drones finally are essential for safety reasons as the drone pilot may need to have a sufficient time to react in an emer- gency situation (hardin and jensen, 2011)."
2,"besides the direct functional costs associated with field operations, there are many other factors addressing the cost of utilizing a drone facility"
3,use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 199 in agriculture.
3,remote sensing for instance implies the collection of a high volume of data requiring increased storage and computational power and some extended time for postprocessing and interpretating the results.
3,high-skilled expert personnel may have to be involved both in data han- dling and analysis which also imply some considerable costs.
3,"a positive turnover in drone entrepreneurship is that the manufactur- ing cost becomes constantly lower as more and more companies provide small configurations with low-cost sensors for agricultural and other applications that are accessible to a wider audience (tsiamis et al., 2019)."
3,"moreover, as the drone technology becomes public available and the drone community turn familiar with open hardware designs and software, many low cost do-it-yourself drones are used for low-cost data collection paving the way for wider acceptable commercial solutions (sørensen et al., 2017; montes de oca and flores, 2021)."
3,"cost components for unmanned aerial systems in agriculture using a uas, regardless of the performed task, always implies some vari- able and fixed costs (table 9.1)."
3,"the variable cost concerns the cost of the operator and its assistants, the cost of the power sources and the cost of energy for recharging, and the costs of repairs and maintenance."
3,it is directly related to its usage and usually estimated at an hourly basis.
3,"fixed cost includes the ownership cost for the drone and its peripherals, the cost table 9.1 cost sources when using a drone."
3,"variable cost fixed cost direct costs • personnel cost (drone pilot, assistant) • ownership cost (for the drone • power sources cost (batteries, fuel and its peripherals, like rtk base cells, etc.) and cost of energy for station, charger, embedded recharging sensors, etc.)"
3,"• cost for repairs and maintenance • insurance and fees • housing and storage • software licenses indirect costs • transportation cost (transfer vehicle, fuels, etc.)"
3,• cost for georeferencing (labor and equipment)
4,"200 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture of insurance and the fees imposed by governmental and other organiza- tions for operating legally, the drone and the costs of software licenses that may be necessary to operate the drone or manage its data."
4,"fixed cost is independent of annual use; however, it is estimated on an annual basis."
4,"by accounting the actual annual use, fixed cost can also be expressed at an hourly basis."
4,"for example, if the ownership of a drone is estimated at 1000 h per year and its actual flight hours are 20 h per year, then its hourly ownership cost is 50 h/h."
4,"variable and fixed costs are associated directly to the use of the drone, therefore, they are characterized as directs costs."
4,"since drones are always used for a purpose of performing a field survey or an agricultural task, for example, applying a plant care product, there might be some extra costs for complementing the task, like image processing or spray material trans- portation and preparation in the field."
4,these costs are not directly linked with the drone and that is why they are characterized as indirect costs.
4,"they might comprise, however, a significant portion of the total cost and they should be also taken into account in the economic studies."
4,personnel costs becoming a certified drone pilot with particular skills implies some official training and passing through a certification scheme that is specialized according to the category of skills.
4,"there are different pilot licenses for instance for different drone sizes, according to their maximum take-off mass (mtom) or pilot licenses based to the line of sight between the pilot and the drone (visual line of site—vlos, beyond visual line of sight—bvlos), special licenses allowing night flights, licenses for drop- ping materials, and others (reger et al., 2018)."
4,each category specifies the capabilities of the certified pilots and their limitations.
4,"globally, there is a variety of different classifications and prerequisites among different coun- tries that describe the pilot capabilities and guarantee his capability to fly safety and effectively a drone in the field (tsiamis et al., 2019)."
4,the european union aviation safety agency (easa) lately has tried to har- monize the legislation among different member states by introducing a risk-based approach in order to verify certified users with specific capabili- ties and skills that are able to respond at different operational demands.1 a drone pilot therefore may be considered a high-skilled person with also different levels of skills who deserves to get paid accordingly.

5,"use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 201 instance, a drone pilot is requested to perform field spraying, she/he must have a particular license for that operation."
5,"moreover, quite often in com- plex operations like bvlos or tasks performed in areas with obstacles, a visual observer might be necessary for assisting the pilot."
5,"however, even for single tasks, if the drone has a high mass and needs to be frequently unloaded and uploaded to a truck (a usual case in material applications on small fields), a second person is again necessary to support the operation."
5,"even though this second person does not have to be equally skilled with the pilot, she/he has also to be paid, rising even more the personnel cost."
5,"and as personnel cost becomes important, solutions allowing the improvement of the performance of the drone become even more essen- tial."
5,"fuel cell power systems, for example, provide a higher endurance during flight and offset time losses for refiling with energy."
5,fixed-wings drones are more suitable for long range surveys at a short time provided a suitable runway for take-off and landing.
5,the personnel involved in a drone operation usually have to spend a lot of time for traveling and perform preparatory or end-up tasks that totally might be greater from the pure missionary time.
5,these tasks must be organized appropriately to minimize their duration and improve the overall performance of a field operation.
5,"time starts “ticking” for a drone application usually one or few days before, by performing some checking for the weather conditions, inspecting the equipment, and requesting the legal permissions for the operation to be performed."
5,"on the day of the application, time starts counting from the moment that all the necessary equipment gets uploaded to the transferring vehicle (car or truck) and continues with the time for traveling to the field."
5,"when arriving at each new take-off position, all the mission preparations are critical and have to be carried out carefully and methodically in order to ensure successful and efficient flights."
5,"before launching the mission, the drone has to be unloaded from its transferring vehicle, placed in the proper take-off posi- tion, unfolded or assembled, supplied with batteries or other power sources, mounted with sensors or filled up with material for plant care applications, programmed by setting up the parameters for its mission, and many more."
5,"field borders might have to be introduced by walking or driving around the field, if the field is visited for the first time, as also some walking inside the field might be necessary to markup physical obstacles, regions of interest, etc."
5,"if ground control points (gcps) have to be used, a person should walk around the field and place them at the proper places and might also have to walk through again at the end to"
6,"202 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture collect them, if they are not going to be left permanently in the field."
6,"if a real time kinetic (rtk) base station is going to be used to assist georefer- encing, it should be set-up properly in the field, establish communication with the drone and the base station, and allow sufficient time to lock its position from the satellites."
6,"before take-off, a final preflight inspection of all the equipment is always necessary to ensure a successful flight."
6,"if more than one sortie is required to accomplish the mission, the drone should return to its launching point, change its power supplies and/or get refilled with material, get a quick inspection, and continue the task with a new sortie."
6,"in case the new task or mission has to be performed to some dis- tance away from the previous one, it might be more energy efficient to move to a new launching/landing point."
6,"in this case, all the equipment and material should be collected, uploaded to the transferring vehicle, car- ried, and re-established to its new place."
6,"after ending the task, all the equipment has to be disassembled and stored to its cases."
6,"if plant care material has been applied, the drone has to be cleaned up thoroughly before packaging."
6,some time for traveling back is also required and time to unload the equipment to their storage place.
6,"from the above point, it is realized that the personnel cost represents a significant portion of the overall costs (lampridi et al., 2019a)."
6,it should be optimized through the adoption of standard operating procedures and effec- tive routines that minimize the time losses.
6,"but the times mentioned above refer mainly to labor associated directly with the field tasks and does not concern the time requirements for tasks performed at a second stage, like postprocessing the images of a field survey, analyzing the results, and extract- ing data-driven decisions."
6,"these times impose a second level of indirect per- sonnel cost that might be even higher than the direct personnel cost, regarding that high-skilled professional staff might be needed to be involved and the amount of time required to accomplish the analysis."
6,"according to reynolds et al. (2019), personnel cost represent a large proportion of the total cost, from 30% to 100% of the cost of vehicles and sensors."
6,ownership costs ownership cost is a fixed source of cost for drone users meaning that it is present regardless of the annual use.
6,ownership cost is associated with capital spending and is comprised of two components: (1) equipment depreciation and (2) the cost of interest for the investment.
6,"there are various methodolo- gies employed for their estimation (lampridi et al., 2019b; sopegno et al., 2016) adapted mainly from classical methods used for cost determination of other equipment, like farm machinery (hunt, 1995)."
7,use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 203 the simplest method for estimating the cost of the depreciation is the “fixed method” which allocates equally the deprived value within the whole lifespan.
7,"the deprived value equals to the difference between the purchase price and the salvage value at the end of lifespan: p 2s d5 n where d 5 the annual depreciation, p 5 purchase value, s 5 the salvage value, (p-s) 5 the deprived value, n 5 the lifespan (years)."
7,"since drones are a rather newbie and fast-growing technology, there is little or no historical information concerning their lifespan and salvage value."
7,"their lifespan, however, is expected to be very short because their rapidly emerging technology results in a quick obsolescence."
7,"assuming a technological evolution similar to that of business computers, a drone would be expected to be replaced every 3 5 years to keep up with tech- nological advances ( jackson et al., 2021)."
7,the salvage value is assumed as the price that a product can be sold at the end of its lifespan.
7,"for a drone, it may be assumed equal to 20% 25% of the purchase value presuming that the drone is still functional and may be used on less demanding operations, or sold to amateurs, or parts of it are traded as spare parts."
7,"besides the ownership cost for the uas, it is also the cost of its per- ipherals, such as embedded or mounted sensors, base stations, and char- gers, that might be also important."
7,"their technological development follows the advances in drone technology, therefore, they are expected to have a similar lifespan and a similar salvage value."
7,"as mentioned above, ownership costs also include the cost of interest for the investment."
7,this cost exists for all the purchased equipment and should be added to the depreciation costs (d) in order to estimate the overall annual ownership cost.
7,"it is usually estimated for the average deprived value: p1s i5 ir 2 where i 5 the annual cost of interest for the investment, ir 5 the real interest rate estimated as: in 2 g ir 5 11g where in 5 the nominal interest, g 5 the mean inflation rate."
8,204 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture cost of power sources the energy storage unit of a drone is utilized to provide power that may vary a lot during a flight.
8,"power demands are high when ascending or having to perform maneuvers and may be different in a tilted flight, when moving against or toward the wind direction or while hovering."
8,"when the drone is used for dropping material (e.g., spraying), the change in pay- load results in changes in thrust force and consequently changes in energy consumption."
8,energy is also required for communication with the base station and may be consumed by the onboard sensors and other periph- erals that require power for their operation.
8,"due to the extremely variable demands and the complex aerodynamics imposed by different drone types, the estimation of the power and energy demands of the drone is rather complex (zhu et al., 2020; zhao et al., 2020; prior and bell, 2011)."
8,several models have been suggested recently to provide insights into power demands and energy consumption for small drones.
8,"some of these are quite simple requiring only a few parameters, while others are very complex comprised of multiple interdependent components that provide detailed representations of the forces of flight and drone design."
8,a comprehensive review of such models are presented in zhang et al.
8,(2021).
8,"the models consider the different conditions of movement of the drone (lifting, landing, hover, and tilted flight)."
8,"they may provide, how- ever, widely divergent results for the same drone delivery operation."
8,energy consumption rate values for instance may vary by a factor of 3 5.
8,"some models appear very sensitive to the choice of their parameters, or they may respond differently to alternative environmental conditions that cannot be reconciled by using a common set of environmental, drone design, and operating parameters."
8,"advanced component models may pro- vide the most detail information, but are the most difficult to develop and calibrate, given the number of parameters involved."
8,published results for energy consumption from drone field tests often do not agree with results from the theoretical energy models.
8,a model based on the blade element momentum theory (bemt) was used in zhao et al. (2020) in order to estimate the power consumption of a multirotor uas powered from batteries for a prescribed flight mission.
8,"the authors analyzed the aerodynamic performance of the uas for lift- ing, landing, hover, and tilted flight considering the propeller thrust, toque the propeller-induced velocity, the airflow velocity, and the for- ward speed."
8,airfoil lift and drag forces were also estimated.
8,"consequently,"
9,use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 205 they accounted for the power transmission losses oriented from iron loss and copper loss on the rotor brushless motors and finally converted the propulsion system power consumption into propulsion system energy consumption (epro) to calculate the difference between epro and li-po bat- tery energy storage.
9,some flight test results were performed to validate the above analysis (table 9.2).
9,the error between the theoretical and experimental results for power consumption from the above analysis was at the range of 1.1% 27.1% with the greater deviations appearing at lower throttle.
9,"the power consumption concerns only the uas motor power demands and does not account for the energy required for its other internal systems (e.g., inertial measurement unit—imu, wireless communication, and global navigation satellite system—gnss)."
9,these systems may also absorb a considerable amount of energy and should also be considered in the power consumption concept.
9,validation of the model results may be performed by estimations based on actual field data obtained from the missions and on power characteris- tics from the batteries and the recharging source.
9,these approaches pro- vide a direct insight into actual energy demands accounting also for the consumption of all the peripherals.
9,a simple procedure is described in the below example.
9,"considering a drone powered by a 51.4 volt battery with a capacity of 40,000 mah from which 20% is retained as buffer power for preserving the battery life and for emergency reasons, the drone has 32,000 mah to accomplish its mission that are equivalent to 32,000/1000 ah 3 54.4 v 5 1657.6 wh or approximately 1.66 kwh."
9,"if the endurance provided is 20 min (0.33 h), the average power demand during a flight is 1657.6 wh/0.33 h 5 4972.8 w."
9,"the energy consumption can be expressed per ha by dividing the area covered during the 20 min flight (e.g., 1.66 kwh/12.5 ha 5 0.13 kwh/ha)."
9,"according to the energy resource that is used for recharging the bat- tery, the cost of energy can be further estimated."
9,"if for instance, rechar- ging is done back to the office, using the civil electric network, the local costs of electricity should be accounted to estimate the cost."
9,"if recharging is made in the field using a fossil fuel-powered electric generator, the specific fuel consumption—sfc (l/kwh) that is the average amount of fuel consumed by the generator per kwh of electricity it generates, should be taken into account."
9,"the sfc depends on the fuel type (diesel, gasoline, propane) the generator uses and the load of its engine."
9,sfc decreases while the engine load is increased implying that it might be

11,"typical sfc values for a diesel generator operating at an over 80% load range from 0.260 to 0.280 l/kwh (mueller-stoffels et al., 2017)."
11,"multiplying the sfc with the amount of necessary energy to recharge the battery (e.g., 0.270 l/kwh 3 1.66 kwh 5 0.45 l), the fuel consumption can be esti- mated."
11,then the cost of energy can be estimated by accounting for the price of fuel.
11,"besides the cost of electricity, batteries are consumable devices with a limited lifespan."
11,"after the end of their life, they are withdrawn for recy- cling."
11,a second cost of use orients therefore from the gradual loss of their storage capacity.
11,"batteries are characterized by their lifecycles, that are the potential number of charging and recharging cycles and age as the number of cycles increase because they lose their capacity."
11,the number of cycles depends largely on the proper battery use and maintenance.
11,charging and discharging outside their nominal voltage window causes physical degra- dation and performance loss.
11,"typical lifecycles for li-po and li-ion bat- teries range from 500 to 2000 h (dündar et al., 2020; liang et al., 2019)."
11,"a prolonged life cycle for a battery pack implies a lower cost of use (kim and lee, 2020)."
11,"for drones powered with fuel cells, the consumed fuel is hydrogen, as the oxygen is pumped from the atmosphere."
11,fuel cells are of the most efficient devices for extracting power from fuels (https://www.energy. gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf).
11,the fuel cell efficiency is defined as the electricity produced per kg of hydrogen consumed.
11,"for a hydrogen-fed fuel cell, it is directly proportional to cell potential (barbir, 2005): η 5 v =1:482 where η 5 the efficiency and v 5 the cell potential in volts."
11,"tests performed in wang et al. (2021) to evaluate a small drone per- formance using different types of fuel cells revealed that in order to supply the drone with an average power of 1.46 kw, an average hydrogen con- sumption of 8.5 g/h was required."
11,the cost for using hydrogen as a fuel therefore can be estimated by taking into account the commercial prices for hydrogen.
11,"however, since hydrogen is provided in compressed tanks, that for uass are partly made of carbon fiber, the cost of the hydrogen storage tanks, if they are not reusable, may be significant and should be also considered."
11,"according to belmonte et al. (2017), the main drawback"
12,"208 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture of fuel cell-based systems is, at present, represented by their high cost, which is about double that of a battery-based system of the same size and for the same application."
12,reducing cost and improving durability are the two most significant challenges to fuel cell commercialization.
12,"in hybrid systems, involving fuel cells and batteries, the cost of using a battery should be also considered in the way mentioned above."
12,"for drones with internal combustion engines, an average hourly gaso- line fuel consumption can be accounted for 1.246 l/kg of mtom."
12,"this is the average value estimated from hourly fuel burn data for small private aircrafts (shen et al., 2021)."
12,"considering the price of fuel, the cost of the power source can be estimated consequently."
12,"costs for repairs and maintenance the use of drones imposes some risks emerging from potential accidental operations, subsystems failure or damage caused by unpredicted factors like unexpected wind gusts, collision with another aircraft, and others."
12,"commercial drones contain various safety systems, like ultrasonic sensors and light detection and ranging (lidars), that help prevent accidental inci- dents improving safety even for less-skilled operators as also systems inform- ing the user about the operational ability of the drone."
12,"but beyond all the preventive measures that may be taken into place for ensuring a safe mis- sion, the normal use of a drone always imposes a physical degradation of its components that finally may end up with a light or more severe deteriora- tion of the drone’s functions."
12,the light deterioration of some functions that do not result on operational inability and mission abortion are called a “soft failure.”
12,"moderate degradations may also occur that lead to mission abor- tion without, however, causing severe damages."
12,"these types of failures result in unscheduled downtime due to repeated missions that in turn, impose a serious increase in the operational cost."
12,more severe failures may result in heavy and expensive damage with a rather small probability of repairing.
12,"in that case, considerable time may be lost until the drone is repaired or replaced."
12,"in most serious cases, catastrophic damage may result in drone abortion due to inability for a repair for technical or financial rea- sons."
12,such a case may lead to a serious loss of the expected lifespan resulting in considerable higher ownership costs.
12,litigation incidents related to third party damages or injury may have another negative impact.

13,"the opposite of reliability is failure rate, which describes the number of failures that are possible to occur over an established time."
13,"reliability may be described by the mean time between failures (mtbf) (usually expressed in hours) while failure rate may be described by the failure in time (fit), that is, the number of expected fail- ures in one billion device-hours of operation."
13,table 9.3 presents reliability and failure rate parameters for the common subsystems of a commercial drone.
13,"many drone manufacturers deploy a duplication of the most criti- cal or vital subsystems in order to enhance reliability and prevent critical failures, but this is not always an ideal solution as it increases the cost, the weight, and the complexity of the system."
13,"despite the significant technological progress in drone reliability, in recent research it was highlighted that drone users complain mostly for functional errors (27.9%), device compatibility (16.8%), cost (16.2%), and connection/syn- chronization issues (15.6%) (klauser and pauschinger, 2021)."
13,periodical maintenance of the drones is essential for preventing system degradation and restoring functionality.
13,"improper maintenance or insuffi- cient repairs could result in serious drone damage, but even soft failures may impose a poor performance resulting in an increased cost of use until the correcting maintenance action is performed."
13,"quite often, soft failures are the underlying cause for heavier damage."
13,a repair action is required thereafter to restore the problem which may impose a higher cost.
13,therefore preventive maintenance actions are essential even if they intro- duce some extra cost.
13,"this cost may be optimized if the optimal preven- tive maintenance intervals, that do not exceed the repairs threshold, are"
14,210 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture determined.
14,"for that scope, the failure rate of all the critical systems and subsystems of the drone should be accounted (petritoli et al., 2018)."
14,"generally, approximately 5% 10% of the purchase price of the drone can be associated with typical annual costs for repairs and maintenance ( jackson et al., 2021)."
14,insurance and fees drone insurance is liability coverage intended to protect the owner or the operator against claims for property damage or bodily and personal injuries caused by the drone.
14,property damage covers a drone accident resulting in a damaged property of others.
14,"bodily injury apply to the medical expenses of people injured by a drone crash while personal injury coverage applies to libel, slander, and invasion of privacy or other psychological-based claims ( jackson et al., 2021)."
14,the liability coverage against damages and injuries to third parties is a legal obligation for all professional drone users.
14,"the provided coverage is compliant with minimum national and international regulations, like the ec ec785/2004 regulation of the european parliament and of the council."
14,"optionally, the drone owner may request hull coverage that covers physical damage of the drone and may also include damage caused to valuable payloads such as a hyperspectral camera, lidar, or another types of sensors."
14,"theft, malicious damage, and system hacking are also some additional coverages that may be provided to drone users by the insurance companies."
14,insurance for agricultural drones is essential because it protects profes- sionals from financial ruin as accidents are likely to occur even in an open field.
14,"the cost for drone insurance can vary largely depending on the type of drone, its weight, the environment, the performed tasks, the amount of liability coverage, and the additional coverage requested by the owner."
14,"since the professional use of small drones is rather new, insurance compa- nies today are challenged to address unknown risks, without having a database of claims to use as a reference."
14,a policy based on drone weight and activity rating appears to be a simple approach.
14,annual policies for lia- bility coverage usually start at around 500 h but may vary significantly among different countries.
14,"drone users, however, may tailor their cover- age policy according to their needs and request an annual plan, purchase coverage by the month, or even ask for a daily plan."
14,"in some countries, annual fees are also required for professional users to retain their license."
14,this is an additional expense that should also be encountered while estimating cost of using a drone.
15,use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 211 software licenses most flight planning applications for drones are free.
15,automated image capture and video registration is also a free available utility for most of the apps.
15,"image postprocessing software, however, and functions related to image classification, and field zonation for precision agriculture applica- tions require an annual or monthly subscription."
15,some companies also provide the opportunity of a one-time fee for a perpetual license.
15,"holistic schemes encompassing image processing, field diagnosis, creation of pre- scription maps and corresponding flight planning are also available at a monthly, annual, or perpetual policy from some drone manufacturers and software developers."
15,"on the other hand, open source software packages and algorithms like opendronemap, qgis, saga, and opencv classi- fication algorithms provide the opportunity to develop replicable work- flows for low cost applications (mattivi et al., 2021)."
15,"housing and storage small drones generally occupy a limited space, especially when they are folded so their storage does not require a large storeroom."
15,"some extra space, however, is required for its accessories like sensors, charger, power generator, and rtk gps."
15,"if recharging of the batteries is performed on the storeroom, some special place, with particular safety specifications is also a prerequisite."
15,the room should also have established an automatic fire extinguishing and suppression system to avoid a potential fire from accidental explosion of a battery.
15,heating and cooling might also be necessary to retain the room tem- perature between specified limits in order to ensure prolonged battery life.
15,"since the stored equipment including the drones, their peripherals, and sen- sors are of high value, a security antitheft system might also be necessary to protect the property."
15,"housing and storage, therefore, of a professional drone entail specific conditions that are far beyond a simple warehouse, increasing the cost of ownership."
15,"in the case of a bigger company, operating a fleet of drones, the storage space, and the safety demands are much higher increasing further the cost."
15,"in that case, however, the space may be organized more effi- ciently, reducing the storage cost per single drone."
15,"the cost is estimated on an annual basis comprising from the building construction costs and the costs of interest or opportunity, amortized over the expected life of the building as also the real estate taxes, insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenses to retain the building functional and the cost for having a security service."
15,these costs are shared by the number of drones stored in the room.
16,212 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture transportation costs drones should be transferred to the operational area for performing their tasks.
16,"mini drones equipped with small sensors for field surveys can be carried rather easily even with private cars, but when the needs imply a higher payload, a bigger drone with increased dimensions may be required."
16,the accessories may also require considerable space.
16,"in the case of field spraying, for instance, a professional operator should carry to the field a drone, that even if it is folded may occupy over half a cubic meter as also a set of batteries, a power generator, a real-time kinetic global positioning system (rtk gps), a tank of water that may be over 200 l, packages of plant protection products, accessories for preparing the mix- tures, and other."
16,"in such a case, a professional vehicle is required for the transportation that has some fixed costs associated to ownership and inter- est or opportunity that are amortized over its lifetime, as also cost for insurance and fees, variable cost associated to repairs and maintenance, cost of fuels, and personnel costs for the driver."
16,"in the case of professional drone services, the vehicle may be employed solely for drone purposes while in the case of a farmer, it may be a multipurpose vehicle covering variable needs in the farm."
16,"in the first case, the whole cost is attributed to the drone services while in the second, it is addressed according to the time allocation in drone transportation in relation to other uses."
16,"despite their direct or indirect origin, the variable and fixed costs are expressed in an hourly basis but for the validation of the profitability of the performed task they should be expressed at an acreage basis."
16,"the con- version from an hourly to an acreage basis implies the estimation of the actual performance of the task (for instance ha/h) which is highly related to the capabilities of the drone, the endurance of the power system, and the restrictions imposed by the specific tasks."
16,"different types of drones (e.g., fixed wings, multirotors) present different capabilities making them suitable for alternative tasks."
16,but one of the greatest challenges today in drone performance is their power supply.
16,"except for the case of tethering, drones have to bear with their power sources (batteries, fuel cells, etc.) but due to restrictions in weight and size, their bearing capacity is limited resulting in limited autonomy."
16,the limited autonomy imposes significant time losses for “re-fueling” with energy the power supply system resulting in poor performance and increased direct costs.
16,"similarly, restrictions imposed in indirect tasks like tagging a survey area for ensuring correct georeference or postprocessing the material of a hyperspectral survey may"

17,"decision aid for estimating the cost of using a drone in production agriculture, kentucky. also result in poor performance and a high functional cost."
17,all these restrictions should be considered carefully in order to identify the most cost-effective solutions for obtaining the expected results.
17,"9.1 presents the change in the total annual cost per flight as the number of flights performed per weak increases (dolias et al., 2022)."
17,there is an inverse relationship between the number of flights per year and costs per flight.
17,"the cost per flight decreases with an increasing num- ber of flights because the fixed costs of ownership, insurance, and fees are allocated over more flights."
17,"as the number of flights conducted per year increases, the total annual cost increases, and this increase in total cost is controlled primarily by the personnel cost."
17,"the college of agriculture food and environment of university of kentucky developed a simple computational decision aid tool for estimat- ing the cost of use and assisting professionals and farmers prior purchasing uas for monitoring agricultural ecosystems ( jackson et al., 2021)."
17,"the tool accounts for the equipment ownership cost, cost of certificates and licenses, personnel cost, cost for utilities, cost of purchasing or using asso- ciated software, insurance cost, and cost of maintenance and repairs of the system."
17,"different cost scenarios can be examined in terms of the onboard camera specifications and image capture settings like required spatial reso- lution and flight altitude, drone speed and necessary image overlap, para- meters associated directly to the area covered during a single flight, and the time for postprocessing analysis."
18,"214 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture cost-effective unmanned aerial systems applications drones are used for two main scopes in agriculture: surveillance, and material applications."
18,each case has its own limitations and challenges for achieving a sustainable and cost-effective use.
18,"surveillance for instance besides effective flight planning, imposes the need for geometric accuracy, data handling, and image processing, that are directly related with the cost of these tasks."
18,"material applications, such as pesticides, fertilizers, and seeds, require accurate placement, avoidance of drift transfer of large quantities, and other operational issues."
18,"surveillance photogrammetric products acquired by drones today are utilized broadly for classifying vegetation types, assessing plant vigor, estimating leaf area, predicting photosynthesis, identifying biotic and abiotic plant stresses, and many more."
18,"until recently, many of these tasks were based on ground observations or were performed with ground portable devices that implied a high human effort and an increased operational cost."
18,"even cheap or free available mobile phone apps, developed recently for assessing various plant traits, present a very low scalability that does not allow a wide scale inter- pretation of their readings in order to address effectively the spatial hetero- geneity."
18,"but the potential of using aerial products from uass opened a new era for monitoring open field agriculture with a high frequency and resolution at an affordable price that permits interventions at a farmer level for improving productivity and net profit (losè et al., 2020)."
18,"moreover, the recent development of small and cheap uass carrying on-board low-cost imaging sensors, along with the development of effective image processing software allowed the wide integration of uas-based photo- grammetry into precision agriculture applications."
18,"the most competitive technology to uas remote sensing today is satellite-based imagery provided for free, including the landsat and the esa sentinel products."
18,"these products can map large areas but quite often, due to their low spatial resolution, fail to address specific needs in agriculture, like identifying the canopy of a tree or a vine row in order to access its geometry or recognizing spatial variability in small fields."
18,"moreover, satellite observations are often restricted by cloud cover result- ing in missing important information."
18,therefore the profitability of using uass instead of satellite data depends largely on the cost of use and the importance of getting timely information with a higher resolution.
19,"use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 215 according to yi et al. (2021), by using a drone-based multispectral sensor to map the normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) and imple- ment a variable rate fertilization scheme in grains, the uas solution do not appear profitable because the average cost per hectare is higher than the average economic profit resulting from its use."
19,"in such a case, a lower resolution satellite acquired imagery may be a more suitable solution."
19,"on the other hand, drone-acquired images can be highly profitable when they are used for higher value crops or high added value applications like precision spraying or foliar fertilizer applications in vineyards (yi et al., 2021)."
19,the size of the surveyed area is also important from an economic point of view.
19,"a recent study in switzerland where farms are rather small, suggests that the cost of using a drone for scheduling variable rate fertiliza- tion should not exceed 6.5 h per hectare and per year if it is to be more profitable than a low-resolution technology like field sampling with an n sensor, or not more than 4.5 h per hectare per year compared to the use of a 10 3 10 m satellite image (späti et al., 2021)."
19,the study also suggests that the net profits increase when a high-resolution technology is applied to fields which exhibit higher spatial heterogeneity of soil conditions and lower spatial autocorrelation.
19,"in matese et al. (2015), it was identified a break-even point of 5 ha, below which, the adoption of uas imagery is more advantageous from satellite or aircraft imagery."
19,the use of low cost rgb image sensors in small uass is another opportunity.
19,"these kind of sensors are able to access some important plant traits like green matter coverage, plant geometry from structure of motion processing, and other (schirrmann et al., 2016)."
19,"high resolution rgb images combined with machine learning techniques may provide insights to even more advanced plant traits like leaf chlorophyll (guo et al., 2020)."
19,"rgb-derived vegetation indices like visible atmospherically resis- tant index (vari) (feng et al., 2020), triangular greenness index (tgi) (feng et al., 2020), and many more are often utilized for estimating crop nutrition and other traits that sometimes perform as well or even better than indexes derived from more advanced and expensive sensors like mul- tispectral and thermal cameras (gracia-romero et al., 2019)."
19,"according to a study examining the reliability of consumer grade rgb cameras mounted on drones, there are three important preconditions that have to be fulfilled in order to get correct results: (1) the ambient light conditions should be stable during image acquisition, (2) the angular variation in reflectance is taken into consideration, and (3) testing of the orthorectifi- cation software to evaluate how it handles bidirectional reflectance"
20,"216 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture (rasmussen et al., 2016)."
20,"in schirrmann et al. (2016), it is stated that low- cost rgb imagery from uass can strongly support farmers in observing biophysical characteristics, but it fails to address the nitrogen status within wheat crops."
20,"according to matese et al. (2015), there are three special sources of costs during the pipeline of surveillance with drones: 1."
20,"acquisition costs, 2."
20,"georeferencing and orthorectification costs, and 3."
20,costs associated with image processing.
20,a surveillance procedure therefore should be organized properly to eliminate each individual cost in order to benefit from the added value of the derived information.
20,acquisition cost acquisition costs refer to all the expenses related to getting the raw images from the field including all the costs for organizing and conducting the acquisition campaign.
20,"they include all the costs described above compris- ing the ownership cost, cost of personnel, cost of energy, transportation cost, etc."
20,"the cost concerns the drone, the onboard sensors, and the peripherals."
20,a key parameter to reduce the above cost categories is reducing the time spent in the field.
20,"optimizing the flight time by selecting efficient flight paths, take-off locations, and recharging plan is crucial for eliminat- ing the acquisition cost."
20,efficient flight planning aims to determine an optimal path that allows the completion of a mission in a minimum time and provides an effective use of the limited capacity of the drone power supply system.
20,"several efforts have been made in the development of energy aware path planning algorithms to extend the size of the area a drone can cover (tamayo et al., 2020; benos et al., 2021; dolias et al., 2022)."
20,"heuristic, multiobjective, and other type of algorithms have been proposed for selecting the path with the balanced score from few turns, few revisits, completed coverage, and minimum traveled distance (campo et al., 2020)."
20,"a drone requires more energy when making turns than going straight (tamayo et al., 2020)."
20,"for large surveys, in-flight rechar- ging, swapping, and wireless recharging techniques may have to be imple- mented (subramaniam et al., 2021)."
20,"since ground stations are also expensive, effective placement in the field, according to the endurance of the drone, is important for minimizing the cost of the operation."
20,dividing the area into discrete squares or cells are some approaches proposed by
21,"use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 217 researchers to minimize the total flying distance and achieving low-cost drone coverage of large areas (yi et al., 2021)."
21,"georeferencing and orthorectification cost obtaining georeferenced and orthorectified imagery during field surveys is essential and crucial especially when multitemporal studies are employed or when the images are going to serve as baseline for deriving accurate application maps, such as spraying specific targets and applying variable rate fertilization."
21,"global navigation satellite systems (gnss) data by itself, without correction, may provide a maximum accuracy of about 1 m but may deviate to a few meters in cases of poor gnss receiver connections."
21,"georeferencing and orthorectification costs include the costs for pur- chasing or constructing artificial geotagging material, for example, gcps, the cost of complementary devices, for example, gnss or a rtk base station and the man-hours needed to spend for setting up all the auxiliary equipment."
21,"despite the georeferencing process having achieved a high level of automatization nowadays, there is still considerable effort required to obtain an accurate imagery product."
21,"at least four gcps are necessary in order to effectively georeference a uas-obtained orthomosaic product but the use of a higher number of gcps is generally advised to introduce redundancy and to better estimate the camera interior orientation para- meters (losè et al., 2020)."
21,a high number of gcps is also necessary for building orthomosaics from similar images captured over uniform fields with limited spectral variation (like the case of a big cereal field with no discrete areas of variability in vegetation).
21,the gcps have to be placed manually over the survey area and their position should be geo-tagged using traditional topographic techniques or by means of gnss receivers.
21,this task may be one of the most time- consuming during the field scouting process and may be extremely diffi- cult in the case of surveying hardly accessible areas.
21,the gcps may need to stay in place for a longer period in case a time series set observation has to be employed and may need to be cleared or maintained regularly dur- ing a survey period to remain discrete on the aerial images.
21,"in some cases, natural and permanent points of interest, visible on the aerial images may also be utilized to eliminate the needs of artificial targets but their posi- tions should be marked at least once at the beginning."
21,"besides field tagging prior the image acquisition stage, the use of gcps in the data processing phase may be also time consuming since an"
22,"218 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture operator needs to manually identify the points on the images in order to link the map coordinates with the image ones (losè et al., 2020)."
22,"some solutions to speed up the postprocessing procedure propose the use of automatic or semiautomatic recognition based on computer vision techni- ques (losè et al., 2020)."
22,"there are also some strategies proposed to opti- mize the field preparatory task, like using coregistration approaches among multitemporal datasets and optimization of the number of gcps (losè et al., 2020)."
22,"more recently, the availability of high accuracy, survey-grade gnss receivers in uass, utilizing double frequencies and multiconstellation techniques, along with information concerning the drone heading, roll, pitch, and yaw retrieved by the onboard imus, has made possible the direct georeferencing of the images without the need of using any gcps (cucci et al., 2017)."
22,"direct georeferencing solutions may reach, in theory yet, a positional accuracy of even few centimeters (losè et al., 2020)."
22,"there are two main technical approaches followed, the rtk technique and the postprocessed kinematic (ppk) (losè et al., 2020)."
22,"in the rtk approach, the camera positions measured by the onboard gnss rtk receiver are corrected in real-time by utilizing addi- tional georeference information sent by a stationary base gnss receiver placed in the field, or by a virtual gnss station created by a network of continuously operating reference stations (corss), a solution known as nrtk."
22,"in the ppk approach, the correction of uas positions recorded by the onboard gnss receiver during the flight and the estimation of the camera positions are carried out after the data acquisition phase, with suitable software."
22,"the rtk approach is faster providing real-time, accu- rate positioning of the drone but requires constant and uninterrupted communication between the drone and the base station restricting its applicability in visual line of sight vlos missions."
22,"in case of a momentum loss of communication and until its re-establishment, it may likely end up with gaps in the dataset resulting in a significant reduction of the quality."
22,"the ppk approach imposes a way simpler setup, it is more accurate, but needs more computational power and impose extra time in the postpro- cessing procedure (padró et al., 2019)."
22,"nevertheless, it is much preferable than having to repeat the mission in case of insufficient data quality from an rtk survey."
22,"image processing costs image processing cost include the cost of use of the photogrammetric software, the cost of the hardware to run the software, the cost for storage"
23,"use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 219 of primary images, metadata and the processed data, and the cost of the human effort involved in the data process."
23,"the image datasets from a field survey are difficult to be analyzed because they are voluminous, complex, heterogeneous, often plagued with errors, and only can be handled with up-to-date scientific and mathematical tools (reynolds et al., 2019)."
23,"the recent development of commercial packages including data acquisition tools and specific image processing pipelines have relieved the bottleneck of data analysis providing the chance for routine tasks to be accomplished automatically in a high-throughput fashion (reynolds et al., 2019)."
23,"public consortia develop also flexible analytic workflows, which are interpretated by the scientific community through an “open science and open source” approach providing constantly new solutions for effective and fast data processing even for material captured from low-cost devices."
23,field surveys regularly produce a huge number of images that must be processed in photogrammetric software to provide a valuable product for end-users.
23,"depending on the flight attitude and the image overlap, a field survey with a four-band multispectral camera may produce over 500 images for a 10 ha field."
23,postprocessing of such a high amount of data implies the use of high computational power and computers with a higher cost.
23,"the minimum ram requirements for pix4d mapper (http:// www.pix4d.com) to process medium size projects containing 100 500 images is 16 gb while for large projects with over 1000 images, 64 gb is required."
23,"moreover, the raw data as well as the final photogrammetric products have to be stored for back-up purposes and potential farther analysis."
23,a single project containing 500 raw images at 1.2 mp resolution requires over 2 gb of storage space.
23,a hyperspectral survey over 1 ha may produce over 10 gb of data.
23,"the volume of data becomes enormous as thousands of data points and images collected in multiple experiments, together with necessary metadata and this is a great challenge for cost- effective surveillance in agriculture with high resolution drone sensors (hardin and jensen, 2011)."
23,increased area coverage with less or lower resolution images results in reduced postprocessing times but the quality of the final product is poorer and may become insufficient for detecting some plant traits impairing the decision-making capabilities.
23,a cost tradeoff exists between the quality of images and the time for image analysis.
23,"the establishment of a standard image acquisition protocol including specifications for imaging conditions in terms of illumination, wind, height, side-overlap, image resolution, lens adjustments, and other parameters may improve image homogeneity and"
24,"220 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture clarity, and conserve human effort for manual image checking and correc- tion and reduce computational times and demands (reynolds et al., 2019)."
24,"overall, the cost of image analysis in survey projects is the most underestimated and may represent 10% 20% of the cost of image capture (reynolds et al., 2019)."
24,"aerial material applications using drones to apply plant care products in the field, including pesticides, fertilizers, seeds, and other agricultural commodities, is another challenge for the uas technology."
24,"the main restriction in such applications is the high payload that has to be carried by the drone, increasing its size and reducing considerably the endurance of its power supply system (batteries, fuel cells, etc.)"
24,"(subramaniam et al., 2021)."
24,a small drone powered by a li-ion battery and carrying a light sensor for surveillance purposes may have an autonomy of 25 min and even more while a drone with a 20 l tank performing field spraying and powered also by li-ion batteries is hardly to achieve an over 15 min autonomy.
24,payload restrictions result also in some changes in common agricultural practices.
24,using condensed products or performing targeted applications are more suitable for uass.
24,the dilution rate of a plant protection product might be 10 30 times lower in the drone tank compared to the rates used in conventional ground field sprayers.
24,"material applications are performed mainly by multirotor uass because they can take-off and land vertically, having minimum space requirements."
24,a drone applying material may have to land for refiling the tank and changing its batteries multiple times during a field task.
24,"to avoid nonworking routes, landing may have to be done at different places."
24,"a fixed wing, carrying a high payload, requires an appropriately reformed runway to take-off and land and this is not always available in the field and especially at multiple points."
24,"as drone-based applications, however, are expected to become regular in the future, it is also anticipated that farmers will reform their land accordingly by establishing permanent take- off and landing points and by creating paths for moving from one point to another."
24,these permanent take-off and landing points should be allo- cated in the field in a way to support an efficient flight planning that aims to maximize the covered area during the limited endurance provided by the power supply system of the drone.
24,minimizing dead routes and turn- ings are critical factors to be considered as also the physical restrictions
25,"use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 221 imposed by field geometry and terrain, natural obstacles, and crop orienta- tion."
25,retaining a visual line of site with the drone all over the missions corresponding to a specific landing and take-off point is also crucial.
25,many agriculture drone manufacturers provide online information on the remote controller about battery power level and the remaining payload to support operators on their decision whether to return the drone for a refill and batteries replacement.
25,"however, during aerial material applica- tions, the endurance of the power supply system and the periods for refiling should be synchronized in order to minimize the needs for landing and take-off and conserve energy and time."
25,"time losses from frequent take-off and landing for refiling with spray liquid and exchanging batteries, during pesticide applications for instance, may increase the operational cost by more than 40% (xu et al., 2020)."
25,"the synchronization of times for repla- cing batteries and tank refiling may be achieved in various manners like adjusting the flight speed, changing the attitude, regulating the dose, or altering the dilution rate of the plant protection products (ppp)."
25,"for instance, a dji t30 drone with a 30 l tank has a hovering endurance of about 13 min with a mean payload, operating on no-wind conditions."
25,"considering a flight height of 1.8 m that provides an effective spray width of 5 m, a flight speed of 2.5 m/s and a field efficiency during flying of 0.9 (10% time losses for turnings, avoiding obstacles and moving to the starting and landing points, but without considering the times being on land), a field performance of 4.05 ha/h is estimated."
25,the area sprayed dur- ing a 13 min flight though is about 1 ha.
25,"if the drone is performing field spraying of a ppp at a dose of 3 l/ha diluted at a rate of one-fifth on water, it applies a dilution volume of 15 l/ha."
25,therefore the drone has to be filled with 13.2 l of spray dilution to spray 15 l/ha at 0.88 ha in 13 min.
25,but using a lower payload (13.2 l instead of 30 l) reduces the power require- ments and increases the battery endurance.
25,there is an inverse power rela- tion between the maximum hovering time and the gross take-off weight of a multirotor drone as depicted in fig.
25,"9.2 (vu et al., 2019)."
25,"by using such a relation for the dji t30 drone and performing optimizing computations, a higher hovering endurance of 15.1 min is estimated and the potential sprayed area is calculated at 1.02 ha (table 9.4, case 1)."
25,the performance of the operation may be improved by altering some spraying parameters within permittable limits.
25,"a potential increase of flight speed, for example, from 2.55 to 3.33 m/s could increase field capacity at 1.27 ha per battery by using 19.05 l in the tank (table 9.4, case 2)."
25,the potential also to use a higher spray altitude to increase effective spray width from 5 to 7 m could

26,"if a higher volume is preferable to improve crop cover- age, there is a chance to use an 1/6.5 dilution rate that would decrease slightly field capacity to 1.5 ha per battery but would take advantage of almost the full capacity of the spray tank by adding on it 29.24 l of dilution (table 9.4, case 4)."
26,the above computations are proximal since actually the mass of the payload during spraying is gradually decreased over time changing the
27,"use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 223 power requirements for hovering, as depicted in fig."
27,"the current load is not connected by a linear function to the operational time, so using a mean payload weight leads to a proximal estimation of the hovering endur- ance."
27,exact models should be provided ideally for each type of drone to access hovering and battery endurance and consequently the appropriate payload in the tank.
27,"for material applications at big farms with large fields, swarms or fleets of drones may be used to increase performance, conserve time, and elimi- nate the personnel cost since one or few operators can handle simulta- neously multiple drones that cover a larger area."
27,"in swarm uas systems, a set of uass work together to achieve a specific goal."
27,"each uas has a small mission which is a part of a bigger mission (elmeseiry et al., 2021)."
27,"experimental results indicated that the performance of the swarm system is significantly superior to the single drone system ( ju and son, 2018)."
27,"multiple uass may require more time to set up and impose an extra ownership cost but a reduction in working time of about 18% 50% together with the reduced operator cost justify the investment, especially when used in large areas."
27,a common challenge for swarm uass is the appropriate assignment of tasks to each drone and their sequence in order to optimize the overall field performance.
27,"multiobjective and genetic algorithms have been pro- posed for that scope that minimize the nonoperation flight distance and the operational cost (xu et al., 2020; ivić et al., 2019; hong et al., 2021)."
27,the algorithms determine the waypoints and the flight paths for each uass and take care to prevent overlapping of flight areas and drone collision.
27,"they are capable to improve the performance by 35% 65% and also improve accuracy and mitigate overspraying in the range of 3% 8% (ivić et al., 2019)."
27,current state and future perspectives uas technology is developing and improving rapidly.
27,"agriculture is expected to be the second most important sector after infrastructure to be benefited from the introduction of uass (losè et al., 2020)."
27,new pro- ducts appear every year into the market to cover the largely diversified demands of the farmers.
27,"in 2015 in china, agriculture uas spraying were registered at 667,480 ha while 4 years later, in 2019, the annual cumula- tive spray area was more than 33 million hectare (xu et al., 2020)."
27,"in 2015 plant-protection uass had a payload up to 10 kg while today,"
28,224 unmanned aerial systems in agriculture models of 30 and 40 kg or even higher are available.
28,"low cost small drones carrying mini sensors along with the development of user friendly photogrammetric products employing simple general user interfaces and routines have made widely available a field survey technology that before some years were utilized only by a small scientific community ( jang et al., 2020)."
28,the development of cost-effective tools based on open-source geospatial technologies will make feasible the implementation of field scouting even in small farms.
28,improvements in batteries power and energy density and the much promising technology of fuel cells is expected to break the barrrier of limited endurance and improve the economic perfor- mance of the applications.
28,innovations in the propulsion system like the double-rotor has made possible an improved drone design that enhances the penetration of ppps into the canopy of the crops.
28,the opportunity to operate multiple uass in swarms is opening the gate for the introduction of task-performing uass into large farms.
28,numerous case studies and experimental data reveal the economic feasibility of using uass for performing field tasks or deploying sensors to provide information for smart and precision agriculture applications.
28,"a study in vineyards proved that using site-specific spraying based on canopy size maps obtained by drone sensors could reduce pesticides use by up to 80% (andújar et al., 2019)."
28,"in another study, it highlighted the opportu- nity to perform low-cost and high-efficiency uas spraying application for olive and citrus orchards."
28,"compared with conventional ground spraying, the uas application presented a 7 h/ha lower cost (martinez-guanter et al., 2020)."
28,"a study in aphid control in cotton revealed that the operation efficiency of the uas was increased threefold, and the amount of pesticide was reduced by one-third."
28,"especially for cotton, spraying with ground- based sprayers during the later growth stages introduces significant mechani- cal damage to the plants."
28,"instead, using uass allows frequent applications to control pests without fearing mechanical damages and consequent yield losses."
28,"besides spraying, there are many other tasks that have potential to be implemented by drones."
28,"rice sowing for instance has proved to be time conserving and labor saving compared to traditional methods using mechanical transplanting and sowing (wang et al., 2022)."
28,weed detection and control is another case.
28,"low-cost uass combined with open-source software seem suitable for weed detection compared to field surveys and other conventional techniques (mattivi et al., 2021)."
28,the information can be used to create prescription maps for performing site-specific herbicide spraying beyond a decision threshold or variable rate applications.
29,use of unmanned aerial system in agriculture 225 agriculture uas applications are expected to accelerate as the benefits will become widely acknowledged.
29,"uass will affect the agricultural sector not only in a practical sense by changing existing farming practices and forcing adaptations to the crops and fields, but also symbolically, by bring- ing particular values and imaginaries and altering the society’s perception on farming (klauser and pauschinger, 2021)."
29,"farmers who use drones consider themselves early adopters who are seeking practices to reduce production costs and/or increase yields but also recognize that special skills and effort required to fully leverage and implement a profitable system (bir and mintert, 2019)."
29,"on aware of that, many agricultural drone man- ufacturers adopt a sales and services policy by setting up professional pest-prevention organizations or plant-protection companies to undertake plant-protection services directly by providing big data support and deploy management services, supervise the quality of the operation throughout the whole process, and standardize the operation process and parameters (wang et al., 2022)."
29,"a recent inventory revealed the six top benefits of the drone technology, as perceived by the farmers as follows: it saves time, makes pesticide application easier, requires less labor, enhances pesti- cide application effectiveness, is superior to other pesticide application methods known to the farmers, and reduces the negative impact of pesti- cides on the environment (annor-frempong and akaba, 2020)."
