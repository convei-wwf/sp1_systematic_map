1,food and drug administration recently published a vibrio parahaemolyticus risk assessment for consumption of raw oysters that predicts v. parahaemolyticus densities at harvest based on water temperature.
1,"we retrospectively compared archived remotely sensed measurements (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity) with previously published data from an environmental study of v. parahaemolyticus in alabama oysters to assess the utility of the former data for predicting v. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters."
1,"remotely sensed sea surface temperature correlated well with previous in situ measurements (r2 ⫽ 0.86) of bottom water temperature, supporting the notion that remotely sensed sea surface temperature data are a sufficiently accurate substitute for direct measurement."
1,"turbidity and chlorophyll levels were not determined in the previous study, but in comparison with the v. parahaemolyticus data, remotely sensed values for these parameters may explain some of the variation in v. parahaemolyticus levels."
