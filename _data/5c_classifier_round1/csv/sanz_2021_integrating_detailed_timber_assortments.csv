2,"these assortments may be utilized and refined by processing plants such as sawmills, plywood mills, pulp mills, heating plants or combined heat and power plants."
2,"some such plants can process various tree species with particular specifications in terms of dimensions and quality, while others may process only one tree species, mixed softwood or hardwood species or both softwood and hardwood (see [5,6])."
2,"to optimize wood procurement planning and various end user- driven refinement processes, it is essential to know the timber assortments prior to trading and harvesting."
2,"this is especially important in countries where intensive small-scale family forestry takes place, e.g., in the nordic countries."
2,"species-specific forest inventory attributes such as stem number, basal area, volume, and mean diameter and height can be predicted from airborne laser scanning (als) data and aerial images together with field-measured sample plots [7–9], after which species- specific diameter distributions can be estimated at the stand level through statistical relationships [3,10,11]."
2,the predicted data can then be used in taper curves and timber assortment reduction models to estimate timber assortment volumes at the stand or tree level [12–14].
2,"thus, tree size distribution models can convert information obtained at the stand level into tree-level data [15]."
2,"it should be noted, however, that all the predictions involved in the previous steps introduce some measure of uncertainty [16,17]."
2,"timber assortments can be estimated from species-specific diameter-height distributions [3] and, as cut-to-length harvesters that record data such as tree species and diameters at different intervals along the stems are commonly used in nordic countries, these timber assortments can be calculated employing cut-to-length harvesting methods such as the nonparametric k most similar neighbour (k-msn) technique [18] or bucking optimizations and tree stem simulations [4,19,20]."
2,"als data also characterize canopy height, height variation and canopy density in a fairly direct manner [21,22] and these characteristics can be linked to some of the essential indicators of wood quality [23]."
2,"therefore, als data can also be used to decide which stands are more liable to have a particular log quality distribution."
2,"while some quality variables are easy to model, many others can be hard to predict accurately, since local variation and historical stand development (including silvicultural treatments of the stands), among other things, are not captured by the laser data."
2,"moreover, timber quality depends on internal and external stem properties, and some of the internal factors are not disclosed until the logs are processed at the mill [24]."
2,"the aims of this work were (1) to assess the accuracy of timber assortment predic- tions and to observe how these affect the commercial value of the final harvest, and (2) to present a method for assessing timber volume, value and wood paying capability (wpc) by timber assortments in the case of norway spruce (picea abies (l.)"

4,field plots the field data were collected between may and september 2015 by the finnish forest centre (ffc).
4,a total of 831 field plots were allocated to forests with varying structure based on the existing stand register information.
4,"in view of possible further analyses, those field plots that were located in seedling stands were removed from the data."
4,"the remainder then consisted of 665 circular plots (figure 1) with a radius of 5.64 m, 9.00 m or 12.62 m depending on the tree density and development class, following the general ffc guidelines [27]."
4,the locations of the field plots were defined with a gnss device capable of achieving sub-metre accuracy after post-processing.
4,"species and diameter at breast height (dbh) were defined for all of the trees with a dbh larger than 5 cm, and the height of every fifth tree was measured."
4,callipers and clinometers were used for these measurements.
4,"the heights of all the trees were also estimated using dbh as a predictor in locally calibrated species-specific allometric models, and volumes were calculated using species-specific allometric models based on dbh and height [12]."

4,"als data and aerial images the als data were collected between june and august 2015 using a leica als60 sn6114 system (leica geosystems ag, heerbrugg, switzerland) at 2050 m above ground level."
4,"the ground speed was 160 m/s, the scan angle was 20◦ , the beam divergence was 0.22 mrad (1/e) and the pulse repetition frequency was 114.6 khz."
4,the density of the first-echo pulses was 1.8 hits per m2 .
4,a digital terrain model (dtm) with 2 m resolution was used to normalize the original als point cloud.
4,the dtm was generated by classifying points into ground and non-ground points as described by [28].
4,the aerial images were obtained within the same time window.
4,"the imaging sensors used were vexcel (denver, co, usa) ultra cam ucxp and s/n uc-sxp."
4,the area was covered by 194 images in total.
4,the flying height was 5 km and the ground sample distance (gsd) approximately 0.3 m.
4,the images were delivered as 16-bit visible light (rgb) and colour infrared (cir) composites.
4,"furthermore, 8-bit orthorectified images were provided by the data vendor (blom kartta oy, helsinki, finland)."
4,methods 2.2.1.
4,"prediction of stand-level timber assortments using als data and aerial images the als data were fused with the aerial image data using the back-projecting als method, i.e., every als point was provided the information from unrectified aerial im- age scenes to avoid geometric errors (see [29])."
4,"the point cloud data including spectral information from aerial images were then used to derive numerous features for each grid cell describing the height, density and spectral data distributions."
4,"the grid size used was 16 m by 16 m, which is employed in operative als-based inventories in finland and has the same area as the standard circular field plots of a radius of 9.00 m utilized in these inventories."
4,"features included percentiles from the height distribution of both the first and last echo data, the density at given absolute and relative heights, and mean and standard deviations of height observations."
4,linearizing transformations of the features were also calculated.
4,spectral distribution features included mean and standard deviations calculated from the spectral distributions of the absolute and relative height thresholds.
4,"spectral distributions were estimated for the red, green and near infrared bands and for the band ratios."
4,"diameter distributions were estimated from the als data fused with the aerial image data for norway spruce, scots pine and birch employing the area-based approach (aba) at grid level for the 249 clear-cut stands, using the 665 field plots studied by the ffc as a reference (for more details about the aba, see, e.g., [7,9])."
4,"the k-msn method (see [18]) utilized the field plot data as well as the als data fused with the aerial image data, and it was applied using the following process:"
5,"forests 2021, 12, 1221 5 of 15 (1) an initial set of variables explaining species distribution, total volume, basal area and mean tree size was selected using correlations; (2) an exhaustive search was then carried out for the initial feature set by testing dif- ferent feature combinations and minimizing the root mean square errors (rmses) of the species volumes, basal area and mean tree size."
5,"the number of most similar neighbours was set at six, which means that every grid cell was allotted to the six most similar field plots and their msn weights."
5,tree lists (also known as lists of stems) were predicted for each grid cell and weighted by the average of the trees measured from the six most similar field plots; (3) the information from the predicted tree lists at the grid level was aggregated at the stand level.
5,k-msn imputation predicts a tree list which provides a weight for every tree in the field plot data occurring in the stand.
5,"for further analyses, the imputed tree list was transformed to a list that contained only complete trees."
5,"this was performed by means of a sample from the tree lists estimated with the aba, the stems were then divided into 1 cm diameter classes, weighted by their probability of occurrence and assigned the corresponding number of trees for each diameter class."
5,"the stems selected in the sample were forests 2021, 12, x forspecified in terms of species, diameter at breast height, height and volume as obtained peer review 6 of 16 from the aba data (see figure 2)."

6,tree lists and timber assortments obtained from the harvester data were always used for reference purposes.
6,we then compared the differences between the approaches for deriving timber assortments from the tree lists predicted using the aba.
6,"first, we calculated the differences in the volume estimates between the aba and the harvester data in order to reveal the differences caused by the tree list prediction, and second, we assessed the differences in the timber assortments between the aba and the harvester data that were attributable to the tree list prediction and the simulated bucking."
6,"in this second case we further evaluated three bucking options for the tree lists: (1) bucking without any reductions due to dimensions or quality (scenario 1), (2) bucking with reductions due to dimensions (scenario 2), and (3) bucking with reductions due to dimensions and quality (scenarios 3 and 4) (see figure 2 and table 2)."

6,distinctions between the calculation scenarios.
6,"bucking method timber assortments quality included maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes sawlogs scenario 1 pulpwood no scots pine and norway spruce: sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals sawlogs scenario 2 pulpwood no birch: veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m scots pine and norway spruce: sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals sawlogs scenario 3 pulpwood yes birch: veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m grade a butt logs (only for scots pine) scenario 4 sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals sawlogs yes small-diameter logs pulpwood species-specific taper curve models using dbh and height as the other inputs were used to taper the stems in the tree lists from the harvester data and from the aba [12]."
6,"when quality was not taken into account, the bucking-to-value simulator used the tapering of the stems, the tree species and the species-wise bucking objectives, whereas when quality was considered, the same simulator employed external quality expressed in terms of vertical stem sections fulfilling different timber assortment quality requirements as specified by the finnish forest companies [30]."
6,"the external quality that affected bucking was estimated in scenarios 3 and 4, in which a stem quality database was used with the msn method [30,31] (see figure 2)."
6,"for these two scenarios, technical defects of the target stems were estimated by selecting the most similar stem from the quality database in accordance with the stand variables, diameter at breast height, and height of the stem."
6,"the stem quality database contained over 13,000 trees measured for dimensions and evaluated for stem quality [31]."
6,"the quality assessment was based on visual estimation of the occurrence of technical defects (scars, crooks, sweeps, forks, knots, etc.)."
6,"the database was collected in various research projects at the finnish forest research institute between 1998 and 2010 (for a more detailed description and the geographic coverage of the database, see [30])."
6,the minimum top-end diameters and minimum and maximum lengths used in the bucking are presented in table 3.
6,"the taper curve models of [12] were used to determine the theoretical sawlog volume, which is the stem volume exceeding the minimum diameter, given a minimum diameter of 15 cm and a minimum length of 3.7 m."
6,"the unit prices for the timber assortment volumes (tav) were eur 67·m−3 for scots pine grade a butt logs, eur 67·m−3 for norway spruce sawlogs, eur 64·m−3 for scots pine sawlogs, eur 45·m−3 for birch sawlogs, eur 33·m−3 for norway spruce small-diameter logs, eur 29·m−3 for scots pine small-diameter logs, eur 22·m−3 for norway spruce pulpwood, eur 20·m−3 for scots pine pulpwood, and eur 19·m−3 for birch pulpwood."

7,the wpc figures used in bucking can be defined as the residual values that a producer can pay for wood when all the other costs are deducted from the sales price [33].
7,we calculated the wpc for each stand as the value divided by the volume obtained with the bucking-to-value simulator.
7,it should be noted that wpc is size-dependent (since longer and thicker logs are more valuable) and depicts the range in which values may vary (see table 3).
7,"the root mean square error (rmse), relative root mean square error (rmse%), bias, relative bias (bias%) and standard deviation (sd) between the measured and estimated values were calculated for the timber assortments to compare the volumes, wpc results and values obtained for the harvester data with those from the aba data."
7,"the rmse and rmse% were used to assess the accuracy of the various methods relative to the reference: s 2 ∑nj=1 yij − ŷij rmse = (1) n rmse rmse% = × 100 (2) yi where yij is the reference value of the variable i in stand j derived directly from the harvester data, ŷij is the estimated value of the variable i in stand j, yi is the average of the reference values of variable i derived directly from the harvester data, and n is the number of observations."

11,"table 4 does not include the total values as these were constant in all the scenarios, as presented in table 6."
11,table 6 also shows the species-specific timber volume estimates and their accuracies before and after bucking at the stand level.
11,the bucking predictions reduced the total volume most in the case of scots pine (28.6% in the harvester data and 11.8% in the aba data) and least in the case of norway spruce (6.9% in the harvester data and 5.7% in the aba data) (see table 6).

12,"discussion our research was aimed at understanding and supporting wood procurement prac- tices, with the prospect of making timber markets more efficient by supplying each user with more suitable roundwood for processing."
12,"the idea was to introduce a method for measuring timber volume, its value and the wpc by timber assortments for norway spruce, scots pine and birch."
12,there are many reasons why different species are used for particular products and this affects how they are traded.
12,"grade a butt logs represent a branchless grade, but norway spruces have branches all the way down."
12,"veneers can be fabricated from high quality spruce butt logs, but these are usually traded at the same price as sawlogs."
12,"norway spruces are not used for poles, since poles are impregnated, and norway spruce is unsuitable for this."
12,"there are only a few small sawmills in finland that deal in birch, so birch sawlogs are almost entirely veneer logs, but for simplicity these are referred to here as sawlogs."
12,it is for this reason that the lengths of veneer logs differ from the actual sawlog lengths (multiple veneer logs are obtained according to the width of the lathe).
12,residual wood is woody biomass which can be collected for energy use or left in the forest to decay and fertilize the next generation of trees and thereby to increase biodiversity.
12,the bucking of maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality estima- tion (scenario 1) and of all sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality estimation (scenario 2) have similar outcomes (table 4).
12,"overall, it can be interpreted from the rmse% values that the combination of the k-msn search (from existing stem quality database) and als data presented here can be used to predict both dimensions and log quality (tables 4–6)."
12,"it is also the case that the rmse% values for both norway spruce and scots pine are smaller for sawlogs than for pulpwood volumes, whereas the rmse% values for birch are slightly larger for sawlogs than for pulpwood volumes."
12,"when three or four timber assortments were considered (scenario 4), the bucking of grade a butt log volumes (for scots pine) and small-diameter log volumes (for scots pine and norway spruce) produced larger rmse% values than the bucking of sawlog volumes."
12,in this context it seems that our approach can help to locate the stands that are likely to be more valuable and have the desired timber assortment distributions.
12,"for all the timber assortments (i.e., grade a butt logs, sawlogs, small-diameter logs and pulpwood) and all three tree species (i.e., norway spruce, scots pine and birch) the rmse% values for the wpc are smaller than those for the volume (tables 4–6)."
12,"the probable reason for this is that while the volume of each timber assortment is only influenced by the proportion of that timber assortment per unit volume, the wpc is affected by the size of the logs as well (i.e., large logs from overstory trees are usually more valuable than small logs from understory ones)."
12,"however, even though understory trees are less valuable, the commercial value of timber stands is substantially affected by the amount of understory trees [34]."
12,other studies have similarly estimated timber assortment volumes.
12,"the authors of [3,4,16,35], for example, used an aba-based on als data to assess the amount and value of harvestable timber, whereas malinen et al. [31] used timber assortment recovery regression models and a decision support tool employing empirical data from sample plots."
12,"holopainen et al. [16] reported rmse% results of 79.2% for sawlog volume and 167.6% for pulpwood volume in the case of scots pine, 33.6% for sawlog volume and 46.7% for pulpwood volume where norway spruce was concerned, and 78.6% for sawlog volume and 218.5% for pulpwood volume in birch, while siipilehto et al. [3] obtained rmse% values of 41.1% for total volume, 40.1% for sawlog volume, and 52.8% for pulpwood volume when studying scots pine."
12,"likewise sanz et al. [4] reported rmse% results of 52.0% for total volume, 209.5% for grade a butt logs, 89.9% for sawlogs, 42.8% for small-diameter logs and 49.4% for pulpwood in the case of scots pine, and vähä-konka et al."
12,"[35] rmse% reported 67.1% for sawlogs and 107.1% for pulpwood in scots pine, 48.6% for sawlogs and 54.8% for pulpwood in norway spruce, and 169.8% for sawlogs and 97.7% for pulpwood in the case of deciduous trees (mainly birch)."
12,"by contrast, malinen et al. [31] reported rmse% values"
13,"forests 2021, 12, 1221 13 of 15 of 6.7% for grade a butt logs, 7.1% for sawlogs, 2.5% for small-diameter logs and 7.1% for pulpwood when considering both scots pine and norway spruce."
13,"although we used als data for prediction purposes, our field data were collected from a large area, allowing inferences to be made with regard to subpopulation parame- ters and indirect estimators or predictors to be used that borrow information from other geographical areas."
13,"this partly affected the bias introduced into the design by the use of different vegetation zones, stem shapes and other geographically related factors."
13,special attention needs to be focused on the covariance structure of the training area data as compared with the target area when non-parametric estimation is used [36].
13,the attribute value distribution of reference database is important in k-msn methodology.
13,"if the target population has a different covariance structure of major variables, it can lead to design bias."
13,"for example, the reason why the rmse% and bias% values quoted here are larger for scots pine and birch than for norway spruce (see tables 4–6) is that norway spruce is the main tree species in our study (see tables 1 and 6) and our estimation method was focused on getting better results for the main tree species than for the minor ones."
13,"the field plots, als data and aerial images were collected within 5 months of the year 2015, and the harvester data were collected between 2015 and 2016."
13,"we could have selected newer data for our study, but we considered these data suitable for our research because they were extensive, detailed and collected within a similar period of time."
13,"the taper curve models of [12] used here are old, but they were compiled using extensive data and they are still used in operational forestry in finland."
13,"the presented methodology can be further improved (1) with denser als data (which can make better predictions of the tree lists), (2) by having a more representative database for the k-msn search (such as more plots from near the target area), (3) by using more precise harvester data, and (4) by collecting more extensive stem quality data with terrestrial laser scanning (which can improve the stem quality estimation)."
13,"the two main novelties in this research are (1) that the investigation was implemented using a real-life forest inventory area and its related data sources, and (2) that this choice of material was supplemented with enhanced methodological developments such as the use of a bucking-to-value simulator, the use of harvester data as a reference source and the imputation of tree lists from field plots in aba."
13,"conclusions in conclusion, our method can be used to estimate wpc values with rmse% levels of 28.7%, 66.0%, and 45.7% for sawlogs, and 19.3%, 63.7%, and 29.5% for pulpwood in the case of norway spruce, scots pine and birch, respectively."
13,it can thus be used for assessing forest stand structure and especially the amounts of the various timber assortments when planning harvesting operations.
13,"further studies will be needed, however, to optimise the parameters and define the restrictions that may apply to this non-parametric approach."
