1,"this poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis’ and requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage, natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally."
1,"it is worth mentioning that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil."
1,"natural drainage (the depth and width are 4–10 m and 50–100 m, respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some salinized villages in the range of 3000–5000 m and ancient groundwater drainage systems, such as karez are supporting the oasis with drainage water for centuries."
1,"in addition landscape characteristics, salinization and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from landsat image, dem, literature and field photos."
1,"then based on the gathered information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape."
1,"then according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization approaches were recommended for different landscapes."
1,"to address environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was validated by stakeholder opinion."
1,the results provide guidelines for sustainable desalinization design and highlight the importance of combining traditional knowledge and modern ecological principles in sustainable landscape design.

1,"introduction interactive zones between irrigated farmland and the natural desert ecosystem, known as eco-tone areas, can develop secondary salinization as a result of irrational management of land and water resources with inherent flat geo-topological problems [1]."
1,"under the complex interaction of anthropogenic and natural factors, salinization in the keriya oasis has shown a fluctuating trend, with salinized areas covering 1670 ha, 1554 ha and 1833 ha in 1991, 2002 and 2008, respectively [2–6]."
1,"in particular, farmland has been subjected to salinization and abandonment."
1,"the keriya oasis has populated about 250,000 people, whose sustaining life mostly depend on agriculture: the main crops are wheat, maize, cotton, rice and grapes."

2,"sustainability 2019, 11, 2578 2 of 17 development has driven the farmland margin deep into the eco-tone frontier [5,7]."
2,"to meet the food demand of an increasing population in the future, more land will be converted to farmland, hence expanding the salinization risk."
2,"currently, a lack of rational land and water management can cause excessive water logging in eco-tone areas (by groundwater seepage); meanwhile, other agricultural areas will experience an induced water shortage [8,9]."
2,"this demonstrates the great requirement of landscape designing to maximize the efficiency of land and water resource use and an opportunity exists to improve the eco-tone ecosystem (decrease the salinization threat) through ecological design and management [10,11]."
2,"it has been proven that the anthropogenic impacts on salinization can be positive [12]; therefore, artificial control of the salinization issue will be a key step towards sustainable social development in the oasis."
2,ecological design approaches aim to restore human-impacted environments through natural processes by incorporating a wider consideration of traditional and scientific knowledge and encouraging the development of multifunctional sustainable landscapes that offer ecosystem services that promote social development [13].
2,"ecological design uses “human–nature dependency” and “cultural cohesiveness” to develop diverse, sustainable ecological design models on a case-by-case basis [14]."
2,"the overall principles are to respect the landscape and traditional ecological knowledge and to be culturally sensitive by integrating bio-physical and socio-ecological inventories of the local environmental history [13,15]."
2,"in addition, traditional ecological knowledge provides a pivotal source of inspiration to sustainable ecological design for today’s eco-environmental problems [16,17], and it has recently been studied in the three gorges reservoir shorelands."
2,this type of comprehensive design increases the efficiency of water and land use [18–21].
2,"when it comes to desalinization design in an arid oasis, there is a lack of diverse research in the area."
2,"taking keriya oasis as an example, most studies in the area have concentrated on landscape monitoring and dynamics using rs technology, salinization assessment and mapping by using comprehensive traditional and scientific knowledge as well as other biophysical and socio-ecological factors."
2,"however, desalinization design on the landscape scale has rarely been investigated [5,7–9,22–26]."
2,"globally, some scholars have used scientific methods to study salt leaching and drainage issues, while some others have studied traditional drainage systems, such as karez, which bring sustainable economic benefits to local people in arid areas [27–29]."
2,"therefore, our proposal combines the traditional and modern knowledge to investigate the desalinization methods, landscape, topography and hydrological conditions in keriya oasis."
2,"the aim of this study is the design of an optimized, ecologically sound and culturally desirable landscape desalinization management plan for the oasis."

14,"discussion the dynamics of keriya oasis’s landscape indicated that the oasis ecosystem was fragile, and it had experienced expansion and shrinking in slightly salinized areas."
14,"excessive water logging at the eco-tone area had caused farmland salinization and even abandonment [5,7,8,30]."
14,the objective of this work was to design asustainable desalinization planning map.
14,"the methodology included the use of landscape ecology, a hydro-geological model, the modern drainage system, the concept of the traditional drainage system and adaptive management strategies."
14,"the idea of this work was to combine landscape ecological principles and traditional knowledge for ecological design in the arid oasis [5,7,22,45–52]."
14,"our work suggests that traditional knowledge is the main intellectual source for modern sustainable ecological design.it is reported that, the groundwater table was significantly declined, for example, the dunhuang oasis’sgroundwater table has been undergoing significant declined, owing to greater pumping, due to expanded irrigation and social-economic development [53]."
14,"this study highlights the respect to the nature, to decrease groundwater table, drained excessive groundwater by gravity and land slope, so there is less risk of groundwater table excessive decline."
14,landscape ecology provides conceptual models and guidelines for sustainable ecological design.
14,"for instance, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis explains how proper anthropogenic or natural disturbance could increase biodiversity.in addition, during the design process, the following requirements should be satisfied: sustainability, pertinancy, heterogenicity, diversity, economic efficiency, integrity and landscape individuality [42]."
14,these are the design principles and guidelinesfor desalinization design in low and flat salinized terrace areas of the keriya oasis.
14,traditional knowledge of the environment and cultural values is valuable.
14,"for example, karez, the specific concept of drainage groundwater and reuse greatly inspired this design idea, and traditional reclamation of salinized land can provide the salt leaching and prevent salinization, since it has adapted to the arid environment and supported anthropogenic activities and culture safely for over a thousand years."
14,"in addition, our design respects the local cultural aesthetics toward water bodies and the local micro-climate."
14,"however, due to the scarcity of landscape design data related to desalinization in the oasis, our design may have some bias, although the map was validated by experts and stakeholders in the second round of interviews."
14,"the development of an empirical, comprehensive and quantitatively 15 14"
15,"sustainability 2019, 11, 2578 15 of 17 evaluated design is significant for this fragile landscape."
15,"our spatiotemporal monitoring program will be supported by 24 groundwater observation wells [7], and it will evaluate the performance of the design and provide information for adjustments and extrapolation to other sites."
15,conclusions this landscape design was aimed at maximizing the efficiency of water and soil resources in a fragile arid ecosystem at a sustainable level.
15,"the design used a combination of traditional land–water management, landscape ecological principles, stakeholderengagement and modernecologicalapproaches in order to frame anecologically sustainable and culturally acceptable plan.since, there were environmental uncertainties, we presented our desalinization design map to the community and receivedpositive feedback (validated by experts and stakeholders)."
15,we also suggested that the use of adaptive management strategies was indispensable when dealing with complex salinity problems.
15,"this study presented different desalinization approaches for different landscape, emphasizing that traditional knowledge is the main intellectual source for modern ecological design."
15,the design map could be used as an exemplar forsustainabledesalinization in the arid oasis.
