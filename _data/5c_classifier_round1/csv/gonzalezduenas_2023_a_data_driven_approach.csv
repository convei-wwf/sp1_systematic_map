1,"existing debris estimation models mainly focus on wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50%, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that can account for other types of debris while im- proving accuracy."
1,"therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic framework to estimate the presence and amount of wa- terborne debris following a severe storm using machine learning (ml) techniques as a function of relevant storm and landcover parameters."
1,"machine learning techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models, employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris removal database for hurricane ike, respectively."
1,"the results show that the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a misclassiﬁcation error of 5.56% for the debris presence predictive model, and a normalized root mean squared error (rmse) value of 11.98 for the debris volume model, the lowest rmse of the tested algorithms."
1,"dual-layer ml models are also investigated, incorporating the debris presence as a predictor in the debris volume model."
1,the results show a percent error of 11.29% for the dual-layer model and an approximately 5.4% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not incorporate debris presence.
1,"the generated debris volume and presence models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource allocation following a storm event."
