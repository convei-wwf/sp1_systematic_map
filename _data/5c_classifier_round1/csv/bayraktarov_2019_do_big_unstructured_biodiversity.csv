1,effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics.
1,"therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed."
1,"this need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed."
1,advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of “big unstructured data” for biodiversity conservation.

1,"this can be achieved laurentiu rozylowicz, only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, university of bucharest, romania and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on “big data.”"

1,we share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop elisa bayraktarov e.bayraktarov@uq.edu.au the australian threatened species index.

2,big unstructured data vs.
2,"biodiversity knowledge creating the world’s first threatened species index as a robust big unstructured data may distract policy makers and resource national headline indicator for australia’s threatened species managers from the need to invest in gathering high-quality time (www.tsx.org.au), we share our experiences from the data series datasets for making informed decisions."
2,this statement collation exercise bringing together all existing data which can be is based on our experience working with multiple stakeholders used for trend analyses of threatened species populations.
2,"several for the development of a threatened species index in australia indicators have been developed to track changes in species where the general perception is that there is a lot of existing populations nationally (van strien et al., 2016) and globally data in public data repositories."
2,"a closer look into the suitability (butchart et al., 2010; brummitt et al., 2017)."
2,some of them of these data for the purpose of calculating species population have been adopted as official “environmental health” statistics trends revealed issues around data collation and curation.
2,"for (gregory and van strien, 2010), while others report on progress instance, species were often not defined to the subspecies against international targets such as those in the convention level or there was no metadata on the specific method used on biological diversity (collen et al., 2009; tittensor et al., for monitoring or the unit of measurement (e.g., number of 2014)."
2,"biodiversity indicators, environmental management, and individuals, nests, traps, etc. recorded)."
2,"likewise, often it was not questions around which conservation interventions to prioritize clear whether the species were monitored repeatedly at the same have a common need for knowledge generated by high-quality fixed site over time. data from consistent long-term monitoring."
2,we illustrate these problems using a global example on but do we know what data we are dealing with and birds and show the discrepancy in quantity between data from whether they are fit for the purpose of answering questions standardized monitoring vs big unstructured data.
2,we conclude of conservation concern?
2,"we suggest that “big unstructured with five key lessons for avoiding the “data trap” i.e., where data,” which comprise large amounts of data collected for massive quantities of unstructured data are accumulated without loosely defined “observatory purposes” may have less utility us knowing what questions they can be used to answer (rillig than currently assumed for measuring changes in populations et al., 2015)."
2,big unstructured data produced without a scientific of species.
2,"at present, vast datasets are being accumulated question may be useful for the generation of hypotheses, but from a range of sources such as earth observation networks not necessarily for testing them."
2,"we call for more evidence to (e.g., national ecological observatory network (neon)] determine if the analysis of big unstructured data can provide (lindenmayer et al., 2018) and citizen science initiatives (isaac accurate trends in species populations to avoid “swimming” in et al., 2014) with an assumption that they can detect changes data but with no wisdom. in species populations."
2,"however, to date, these have not been sufficiently benchmarked against traditional ways of measuring changes in populations of species (e.g., repeat measure animal the data deficiency for robust tracking data) to understand their utility."
2,"undoubtedly, remote species management sensing data can be valuable for some biodiversity tracking approaches, especially when used in concert with targeted long- one of the greatest problems faced by conservation managers term population data."
2,"while there are cases where remote and policy makers is the availability, consistency and continuity sensing products were effectively used and validated to assess, for of well-designed long-term monitoring data to support robust example, global forest cover change over time (buchanan et al., decision-making under dwindling conservation budgets 2013; hansen et al., 2013), no remote sensing technology exists (lindenmayer et al., 2018)."
2,"such data are critical for conserving to quantify the trajectory of populations of mobile species of threatened species which are often cryptic and difficult to conservation concern unless combined with animal tracking data monitor (legge et al., 2018)."
2,"equally challenging is establishing from telemetry devices (tibbetts, 2017)."
2,studies have tested the and tracking drivers of biodiversity change.
2,"meeting these effectiveness of opportunistic citizen science data with no success challenges requires careful planning, a robust design for and detecting long-term population declines (isaac et al., 2014; kamp implementation of question-driven monitoring, stable funding, et al., 2016) unless rigorous models correct for observation, good infrastructure supporting data collection as well as data reporting and detection biases and data were validated against storage, curation, and sharing (legge et al., 2018)."

3,big unstructured data vs.
3,"biodiversity knowledge decision-making (sensu cambridge english dictionary, 2018)."
3,a common opinion when monitoring is being planned or evaluated is “all data are valuable” or “more data are better.”
3,"however, these assumptions are largely untested and whether they are true may be context specific."
3,"for example, it is difficult to determine if population declines or increases are real or identify the drivers of temporal change from incidental records of a threatened species without having information on context (e.g., whether habitat was logged, burned, or restored)."
3,"the value of data depends on how useful they are to those charged with achieving outcomes (e.g., to stop species extinction or improve environmental management field et al., 2005)."
3,"if data cannot generate this type of knowledge, an investment in any derived action can fail to achieve a useful outcome."
3,"in this way, the value of data depends on the problem sought to be solved."
3,"for instance, the keeling curve provides critical long-term data on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and thereby influences policies to reduce carbon emissions."
3,"high quality data from long-term monitoring measuring essential biodiversity variables are especially needed for policies depending on understanding temporal trends in biodiversity (brummitt et al., 2017)."
3,"in general, the value of data increases the longer a scientifically robust monitoring program has been running (cunningham and lindenmayer, 2017) and more comparable data points are collected (lindenmayer et al., 2018)."
3,"this is because some environmental trends become apparent only after 10, 15, or 20 years of data collection (lindenmayer et al., 2018)."
3,"indeed, well established long-term and fit-for-purpose monitoring not only generates the most ecologically effective data in the most cost- figure 1 | comparison of global bird data collection of standardized (a) vs. big data (b) between 1970 and 2018."
3,"data in (a) from the living planet index effective way but has also led to major key discoveries (legge (lpi) database are sites with time series information from repeated et al., 2018)."
3,we therefore argue that question-driven long-term observations of species using the same monitoring method and in (b) from the studies must be maintained as a benchmark for quality datasets global biodiversity information facility (gbif) are occurrence records without and to validate and/or enhance the utility of big unstructured monitoring method information which were aggregated to unique latitudes and data. longitudes per species.
3,"lpi data contain 9,230 site-based time series aggregated from data collected with a consistent monitoring method (sites can be small monitoring plots/areas/transects or aggregated to the state/province/country level)."
3,"gbif data contain information on 16,800,224 avoiding the data trap–bird data as distinct survey locations with unique latitudes and longitudes aggregated from a global example 537,424,092 total surveys with spatial information while omitting 2,188,462 surveys without spatial information (not shown here)."

3,"the global biodiversity information index database www.livingplanetindex.org, downloaded on 13 march 2018 facility (gbif) is an international network funded by the world’s and gbif.org (2018), downloaded on 14 march 2018. governments to integrate and provide open access to biodiversity data."
3,"in the case of birds, the broad-scale citizen-science project ebird is providing roughly 20% of the data available on birds in 1970 and 2018 (<1% of the gbif database)."
3,"our efforts to gbif (sullivan et al., 2017) and the initiative is investing in efforts aggregate gbif data to create site-based time series for trend to develop statistical approaches to assess temporal trends based analyses and compare to trends produced with lpi data were on occupancy probabilities."
3,"currently, the gbif database hosts unsuccessful."
3,this was because the former represents specimen >500 million bird occurrence records published between 1970 records collected with different monitoring methods and variable and 2018.
3,"at first glance, this large volume of data appears to be effort and/or for which reliable meta-data are lacking, i.e., point- great news."
3,"however, the database contains very few sites with location data. “structured” bird surveys i.e., monitoring the same location over reasons for the paucity of structured vs. unstructured time using consistent, scientifically-determined methods such data may include people simply running out of funding as those collated by the living planet index (lpi)."
3,"there are and therefore having to abandon scientifically-based bird presently over 9,000 site-based time series from structured bird monitoring programs."
3,"some may assume that ad hoc practices monitoring in the lpi database, including data from schemes for “recreational” or “outreach” purposes may be good enough such as the north american breeding bird survey, between to produce information for species monitoring."

4,"modifications of sampling protocols long-term ecological research (lter) networks are invaluable during a monitoring program may confound temporal for gathering the data needed for biodiversity conservation trends with method changes (lindenmayer et al., 2018)."
4,big and environmental management.
4,"for example, the lter unstructured data, although abundant, typically have a high network in australia had 12 monitoring networks, which for level of noise to signal ratio which obscures the signal on decades, specialized in conducting stratified and well-designed real trends (cunningham and lindenmayer, 2017)."

4,data collected and published by such measure the “correct” variables to answer questions about networks are at the top of the hierarchy of the data value biodiversity. proposition compared with the generally disparate alternatives.
4,"big unstructured data may not deliver useful knowledge to however, despite their inherent value and rarity, these long-term address species declines."
4,"they may even create misinformation ecological research networks are no longer supported in australia because they often do not tell us about the trajectories of (lindenmayer and 68 others, 2017). species of conservation concern, key ecological processes, whether or not the big unstructured data on birds can, or or management interventions."
4,"for much of the biodiversity cannot, be mined to deliver meaningful trends and infer causality at risk, there are often few data points."
4,"while methods about temporal changes in populations and especially declines to exploit big unstructured data (szabo et al., 2010) on is an unanswered question."
4,"we aim to resolve this question for biodiversity are emerging, their usefulness for facilitating threatened birds in australia by comparing threatened species key needs (e.g., threatened species listing, species protection index trends produced with standardized vs. big unstructured and prioritization) are not yet proven (isaac et al., 2014) data using the same suite of species in the future."
4,"clearly, big and unstructured data have often failed to detect long-term unstructured data cannot substitute for long-term standardized population declines (kamp et al., 2016)."
4,we highlight two datasets.
4,the availability of high-quality data is a prerequisite pervasive issues with big unstructured data: (a) they are to enable robust statistical comparisons to outputs from big increasingly being collected without reference to appropriate unstructured data to validate and/or enhance their utility.
