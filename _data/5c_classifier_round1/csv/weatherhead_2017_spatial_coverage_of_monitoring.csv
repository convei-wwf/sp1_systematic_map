1,this paper quantifies the spatial coverage represented by a finite set of monitoring stations by using global data—data that are possibly of lower resolution and quality.
1,"for il- lustration purposes, merged satellite temperature data from microwave sounding units are used to estimate the representativeness of the global climate observing system reference upper-air network (gruan)."
1,"while many metrics exist for evaluating the representativeness of a site, the ability to have highly accurate monthly averaged data is essential for both trend detection and climatology evaluation."
1,"the calculated correlations of the monthly averaged upper-troposphere satellite-derived temperatures over the gruan stations with all other pixels around the globe show that the current 9 certified gruan stations have moderate correlations (r $ 0.7) for approximately 10% of the earth, but an expanded network incorporating another 15 stations would result in moderate correlations for just over 60% of the earth."
1,"this analysis in- dicates that the value of additional stations can be quantified by using historical, satellite, or model data and can be used to reveal critical gaps in current monitoring capabilities."
