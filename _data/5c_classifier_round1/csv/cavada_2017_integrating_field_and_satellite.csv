1,spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform con- servation planning and management.
1,"however, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats."
1,"this is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-­layered and species-­rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots."
1,"we developed an approach that calibrates remote-­sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models."
1,we applied generalized ­linear models (glm) to relate 9.8-­ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics ­extracted from landsat 8 imagery.
1,"we tested the potential of this approach for spatial infer- ence of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus mon- key, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance."
1,the best glm had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area.
1,our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements.
1,results show the potential of using open-­access and global remote-­sensing data to derive an important predictor of ­animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density.
1,"this approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation."
1,"this is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as ­improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas."

1,"however, because spatially explicit modeling (guisan and zimmermann of limited and substandard data, spatially explicit models 2000, guisan and thuiller 2005, wulder and franklin are less exploited in tropical areas compared to temperate 2006, anadón et al."

2,"therefore, methods are needed to characterize features of the forest structure that are relevant to target species, particularly for inaccessible areas where landsat images represent the only feasible option."
2,"in this study, we aimed to derive arboreal primate density from remote-­sensing estimates of “tree stem basal area.”"
2,"basal area is typically related to canopy cover (alexander 1971, farr et al."
2,"1989, smith et al. 1992), but the two measures are not directly interchangeable (cade 1997)."
2,"in particular, mean basal area specifically measures the contribution of each tree to biomass and hence iden- tifies forest structure, succession stage, and disturbance."
2,"accordingly, it is a common measure of habitat quality for predicting animal abundance (braithwaite et al."
2,"1989, medley 1993, umapathy and kumar 2000)."
2,"this is espe- cially true for nonhuman primates (mbora and meikle 2004, cristóbal-­azkarate et al."

6,"the relationship with mba shown by the first pca component of our model might be due to a large presence of trees with great basal area and tall canopy, causing pronounced shad- owing, which translates in a lower reflectance."
