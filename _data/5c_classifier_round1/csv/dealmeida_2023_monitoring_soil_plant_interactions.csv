1,"in this case, the management zones (mz) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management."
1,"currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing mzs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different."
1,"therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the poten- tial of these datasets to design mzs."
1,the study was conducted at a corn field located in paraguay.
1,"the datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (i) electrical conductiv- ity, (ii) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (iii) spectral information (opti- cal and thermal) derived from landsat 8 images."
1,mzs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps.
1,"in this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between mzs and yield maps."
1,the best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from landsat 8.
1,"correlations between vegeta- tion indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for nbr2 index, but evi, savi and ndvi also presented good results (r > 0.7)."
1,"furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at v8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between mzs and yield."
1,"finally, the mzs derived from spectral data could define yield-limiting zones inside the crop field."

2,"precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 1381 introduction maize (zea mays l.) is classified by the food and agriculture organization (fao, 2019) as one of the main agricultural crops, standing out for its economic and nutritional rel- evance, as well as supporting the world food security (fao, 2019)."
2,"global maize produc- tion was equivalent to 1.16 billion tons in 2020, with latin america and the caribbean region contributing with 18% of the global production (usda, 2021)."
2,"growing demand for grains has forced the agricultural sector to develop strategies to improve crop yield and consequently the food production (foley et al., 2011)."
2,"however, this is a challenging task that usually requires intensive use of resources, such as fertilizers and water."
2,"in fact, these resources must have an optimized use and low environmental impacts, which will guaran- tee a sustainable activity (miranda & lício, 2014; tsunechiro et al., 2008)."
2,"maize fields can have an expressive spatio-temporal variability, which should be con- stantly monitored."
2,"an interesting method to support farmers in this issue is the manage- ment zones (mz), which correspond to sub-regions in a field based on yield-limiting factors, such as soil ph, fertility or moisture."
2,"in this case, each zone has homogeneous con- ditions for plant development and consequently require a specific management, e.g., differ- ent fertilizer application rates (matias et al., 2015; umbelino et al., 2018)."
2,"this approach has been widely used to indicate site specific fertilizer application (bernardi et al., 2018; cordero et al., 2019; ortega & santibáñez, 2007), to improve irrigation management prac- tices (chauhdary et al., 2020), and also to understand the spatial variability of crop yield (kharel et al., 2019)."
2,"the design of mzs can be challenging in areas with high variability of soil physi- cal, chemical and biological attributes."
2,"several techniques have been proposed to delin- eate mzs, such as using soil attributes maps (interpolated from conventional soil analy- sis), soil electrical conductivity (ec), remote sensing (rs) data, crop yield/fruit quality maps, or even a combination of them (arshad et al., 2019; oldoni et al., 2019; rossi et al., 2018; umbelino et al., 2018)."
2,"within these datasets, rs have been considered a promising resource for agricultural management decisions (song et al., 2009)."
2,"satellite images cap- ture spatio-temporal variations in vegetation, which can be directly related to the variability of soil attributes, plagues, diseases."
2,"based on plant spectral data, it is possible to retrieve vegetation indices, such as the ndvi (normalized difference vegetation index), which are directly correlated to vegetation health and crop yield (cicore et al., 2016)."
2,"although rs is a promising technique, there are few studies evaluating the relationships between plant canopy sensing and the soil‐based mz, as well as their combined potential to improve crop management."
2,"song et al. (2009) evaluated three combinations of data sources for delineating mzs in wheat fields, which corresponded to conventional soil analysis and yield data, crop rs information (from worldview satellite) and their combination."
2,they suggested that mzs derived from rs data was a feasible and reliable alternative.
2,"therefore, there is a need for further and more extensive studies, resulting in a better understanding of the relationship between soil properties, crop sensing techniques and the spatial patterns revealed by clustering procedures (casa et al., 2017)."
2,"considering the above, the main objective of this work was to evaluate the contribution of different sensing data sources to delineate mzs in a maize field."
2,"also aims to: (a) com- pare different vegetation indexes and evaluate which one better described the maize yield variability; (b) define the ideal corn phenological stages for remote sensing monitoring, focusing on the evaluation of corn yield variability; and (c) evaluate the relation between the conditions of specific soil management zones and the respective corn yield."

3,"1382 precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 these goals, mzs based on remote (satellite) and proximal (electrical conductivity) sensing were compared to the ones delineated by soil attributes maps, which were derived by field sampling and geostatistics (conventional approach in precision agriculture)."
3,"based on such comparisons, was expected to indicate the importance of rs and ec to mzs design, as well as their capacity to enhance conventional approaches like soil attributes based mzs."
3,"material and methods study area, soil and yield data acquisition the study was carried out in a 226-ha field located in eastern paraguay."
3,"the climate is cfa according to the köppen system, with an average annual temperature of 21.2 °c, pre- cipitation of 1637 mm and altitude about 350 m."
3,the region is characterized by hot and humid summer and dry winter.
3,"in this location predominates rainfed crops, focusing on grain production."
3,"this study evaluated the results from the 2014 winter harvest, which had corn sowed in march and harvested in august."
3,"yield data was acquired with a combine harvester yield monitoring, sixty-six soil samples were collected at 0–20 cm depth, following a semi-regular sam- pling grid."
3,"soil samples were air-dried and laboratorial analysis were carried out to quan- tify soil organic matter (om), organic carbon (c), concentration of exchangeable cations as calcium ­(ca2+), magnesium ­(mg2+), potassium ­(k+), aluminum ­(al3+), potential acid- ity (h + ­al3+), ph ­(cacl2), total cation exchange capacity (cec), sum of bases (sb), alu- minum saturation (m%) and base saturation (bs)."
3,at these sampling points the yield values were acquired through a combine harvester.
3,remote and proximal sensing data the soil electrical conductivity (ec) data were acquired using the veris 2800 sensor (proximal sensing).
3,this equipment has 6 rotary discs and the arrangement of internal and external discs allows simultaneous measuring of the ec in 0–30 cm and 0–90 cm.
3,"in this case, two intermediary discs emit an electric current, while another discs detect the poten- tial difference between electromagnetic fields in the soil (umbelino et al., 2018)."
3,the ec was acquired in each soil sampling point.

3,geological survey earth explorer.
3,"images dates corresponded to may 18th, june 19th, july 5th and 21st, august 6th and 22nd, comprising the period between crop’s sowing and harvesting."
3,"the dataset consisted of higher-level products from the tier 1 landsat collection, which were processed by lasrc algorithms (usgs, 2018)."
3,"landsat bands used in this study were blue (452–512 nm), green (533–590 nm), red (636–673 nm), near-infrared (nir, 851–879 nm), shortwave infrared 1 (swir-1, 1566–1651 nm), short- wave infrared 2 (swir-2, 2107–2294 nm), thermal infrared 1 (tir-1, 10,600–11,190 nm) and thermal infrared 2 (tir-2, 111,500–12,510 nm)."
3,"all bands have a 30 m spatial resolu- tion, except for the thermal ones, which have 100 m resolution."
3,"later, six spectral indexes were calculated (table 1) and compared to soil attributes and yield data."
3,"the indexes cor- responded to enhanced vegetation index (evi), land surface temperature (lst), nor- malized burn ratio 2 (nbr2), normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), soil adjusted vegetation index (savi) and temperature vegetation dryness index (tvdi)."

4,"land surface temperature (lst) can be an important information, once it is related to the crop energy balance, plant water deficits and consequently yield."
4,"lst was cal- culated according to ermida et al (2020) and later used to define the temperature veg- etation dryness index (tvdi), which integrates temperature, plant cover and biomass (du et al., 2017)."
4,"tvdi calculation depends on parameters “a” and “b”, which are retrieved by a linear function between lst and ndvi (i.e., dry edge)."
4,"a typical scatter plot between lst and ndvi presents the points dispersion in a triangular or trapezoi- dal shape, also known as “evaporative triangle/trapezoid”, and indicates the evapora- tive dynamics and surface moisture in the field."
4,"the “dry edge” corresponds to the upper side of the evaporative triangle/trapezoid and comprises the maximum tempera- tures detected by satellite, as well as indicates water limited conditions."
4,"there is also a “wet edge”, which is the evaporative triangles/trapezoids lower side and represents conditions of maximum evapotranspiration due to higher water availability (sandholt et al., 2002)."
4,geostatistical analysis field sampled data and geostatistical techniques were used to map the soil attributes and corn yield at a 30 m resolution.
4,"ordinary kriging was performed in arcgis 10.5 (esri, redlands, ca, usa), the spatial variability of soil attributes and crop yield was mapped based on adjustment of theoretical functions to the models of experimen- tal variograms."
4,"in the adjustment of theoretical models to experimental variograms the nugget effect (c0), sill (c0 + c) and range (a) were determined."
4,"the models tested for adjustment were spherical, exponential, gaussian and linear."
4,"models were chosen based on the least-squares criterion, choosing the models with the highest ­r2 (coefficient of deter- mination) and lowest rmse (root mean squared error) obtained by the cross-validation."
4,"spatial dependence was measured using the degree of spatial dependence (dsd), using the c0/(c0 + c) ratio and the intervals proposed by cambardela et al. (1994), who con- sidered the spatial dependence to be weak (dsd > 75%), moderate (25% < dsd < 75%) and strong (dsd < 25%)."
4,"later, pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between all soil attributes and corn yield."
4,interpretation of fertility levels in the soil was based on the fertility manual from brazilian soil science society (2004).
5,"1384 precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 principal component analysis six mz maps were established, each one from a different dataset (fig. 1): (i) based on electric conductivity from two soil depths (ec), (ii) using only soil attributes (s), (iii) spectral indexes from the single date that was best correlated to productivity (si 1), (iv) spectral indexes from all dates (si 2), (v) si 1 combined with ec (ec-si 1) and, (vi) si 2 combined with ec (ec-si 2)."
5,"the dataset was resampled and standardized (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1) to the same extension, pixel size and order of magnitude, allowing comparisons."
5,"a principal component analysis (pca) for dimensionality reduction was performed, aiming to minimize data redundancy and facilitate interpretation without loss of infor- mation."
5,"in pca, the original variables in n axes are rotated and converted into principal fig."

6,"precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 1385 components (pcs), which are uncorrelated variables in new axes, which maximize data variance through orthogonal linear recombination of the attributes."
6,"besides that, pca also highlights important variables in the data distribution."
6,"the pcs that explained at least 80% of the total variance in each dataset (adams, 1995) were used in the analysis."
6,"soil management zones (mz) once the pca was performed to each dataset, the components’ scores were employed in a clustering technique and resulted in the mzs maps."
6,"in this study clusters were defined by the fuzzy c-means algorithm (fcm), which is an unsupervised classification technique widely explored in precision agriculture (breunig et al., 2020; gavioli et al., 2016; minasny & mcbratney, 2002)."
6,"in fcm, the dataset x = {× 1, × 2, …, xn} is divided in c groups given the object membership degree in j group."
6,the method assumes that each observation belongs to one or more groups.
6,"at each iteration, the nearest centroid from each data point is recomputed aiming to minimize the function (albornoz et al., 2018): n c ∑ ∑ | | 2 jm = . .um | x − cj | | , 1 < m < ∞ ij || i | i=1 j=1 where jm = weight measure of the squared distance between pixels and class centroids; n = total number of elements; c = number of clusters; uijm = membership degree of xi in j group; xi = ith object in set; cj = center of d-dimensional group and m = fuzzy weighted index that regulates uncertainty of groups."
6,the study site was clustered in 2 to 7 groups and later the best partitioning was selected based on partition coefficient (pcf) and partition entropy (pe) indexes.
6,pcf provides information about the fuzziness of the partitions but does not relate with the dataset under analysis.
6,"higher pcf values indicate better grouping (bezdek, 1981; dunn, 1973)."
6,pe indi- cates the amount of fuzziness in each partition and lower values are related to crisp clus- ters.
6,"higher pe values indicates the absence of any clustering structure in the datasets or inability of the algorithm to define the partitions (bezdek, 1981): n c ∑ ∑ pc ∶ f(u;c) = . .(uij )2 ∕n. i=1 j=1 n ∑ ( ) pe ∶ h(u;c) = .h uk ∕n. k=1 where h = shannon’s entropy; utk = kth column of u ∈ mfc, being mfc the fuzzy c-parti- tion space; f a multiple of the squared euclidean length of u."
6,"to measure the clustering ambiguity, the confusion index (ci) was calculated for each cell of the spatial grid (burrough et al., 1997)."
6,burrough et al. (1997) defined the ci as the ratio between the second and the first highest membership values at an observation.
6,"if ci value is close to 0, the observation is strongly associated to the first dominant class and consequently there is little confusion."
6,"however, if ci is close to 1, the difference between the two membership values is small, implying more confusion."
6,higher confusion indexes might be associated with an intergrade between the two dominant classes.
7,"1386 precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 crop assessment by remote sensing remote sensing assessment of plants and soil can be done from a punctual or spatial per- spectives (demattê, 2016)."
7,the punctual one relies on the evaluation of spectral signatures at a specific location and target.
7,"in this study, five locations were selected to represent the variability of yield and its relationship with corn spectral behavior."
7,"the spatial assessment is related to the evaluation of color composite images, which provide spatially explicit features related to soil–plant conditions."
7,"in this case, the 5(r) 4(g) 3(b) colored compo- sition associates landsat 8 bands 5 (nir), 4 (red) and 3 (green) to channels r, g, b, respectively."
7,"the false infrared color composition aids to the interpretability of the image, with healthier plants reflecting more energy in the infrared region (taiz et al., 2017)."
7,"con- sequently, in this composition the vegetation is represented in shades of red, with more intense tones indicating better plant conditions."
7,"on the other hand, soil and crop residue are represented in the composition by bluish colors, allowing an easy discrimination between different land uses, as well as a good indication of crop canopy development."
7,"relation between soil management zones and corn productivity to evaluate the mzs capacity to discriminate areas with different productivity, was per- formed the pairwise t-test and pairwise wilcox test."
7,these methods compare each test series with one another and evaluate if there are statistically significant differences.
7,"in other words, results with p-value < 0.05 indicate a statistically significant separability of maize productivity by the zones."
7,"furthermore, the yield map was used as a quality indicator for the mzs."
7,"was considered that the greater the homogeneity of yield within the zone, the more efficient the zoning process."
7,results and discussion soil dataset description the concentration of soil chemical attributes in the study site was fairly variable and pre- sented different patterns according to the evaluated nutrient (table 2). ­
7,"ca2+ and ­mg2+ had medium concentrations (mean values of 39.0 and 9.0 mmolc.dm−3, respectively), while the mean ­k+ content was very high (4.0 mmolc.dm−3). ­"
7,"k+ is an important nutrient and exten- sively demanded by the corn plants in initial growth stages (coelho et al., 2008)."
7,"the mean bs corresponded to 50%, which is also considered a medium value."
7,"the cv of most soil properties were moderate (15–35%) and all coefficients corroborated with previous experi- ments involving maize in paraguay and southern brazil (corassa et al., 2016). ­"
7,"al3+ and ­al3+ saturation had higher cv (41.03% and 41,34%, respectively), negative skewness and variation from low to medium contents."
7,om and ­cec7 contents were considered medium and soil ph was very high indicating acid soils.
7,"in all those cases, variables had low varia- bility (cv < 15%) and negative skewness."
7,"furthermore, sb, ­cec7, ­ca2+ and ec had a lep- tokurtic curve, i.e., presents a kurtosis measure greater than that of the normal distribution."
7,"ec presented a moderated variation in soil (15 < cv < 35%) (table 2), which was already expected since it is strongly influenced by soil water content, porosity and struc- ture."

8,"potassium also had positive correlation with om, which can be an natural source of nutrients and because it contains negative colloidal charges that retain cations (wang and huang 2001)."
8,"except for ­k+, om had no correlation with other attrib- utes, and it may have occurred due to the low variability in the site (corassa et al., 2016)."
8,"as previously described by malavolta (2006), the ph values observed in the study area (4.02 to 5.11; tables 1 and 2) had great influence in nutrient availability."
8,"lower acidity levels elevated the availability of soil nutrients, since the solubilities of some mineral com- pounds are related with ­h+ content in soil solution."

10,"the highest positive coefficients were observed for bs (0.64) and ph (0.63), in agreement with rodrigues et al."
10,(2012).
10,sun et al. (2003) observed that the spatio-temporal variation of soil attributes (mainly those related to fertility) is one of the factors of greatest influence in soil quality and consequently plant development.
10,"the soil attribute that most affected productivity was the ­al3+ content, the exchangeable alu- minum in the soil increased with the reduction of ph."
10,the association between an increase in ­al3+ and a reduction in ph reduced corn yield.
10,according to abreu et al.
10,"(2003) ­al3+ is toxic to plants, causing a reduction in growth and consequently a reduction in productivity."
10,geostatistical analysis of soils the spatial analyses of soil attributes were performed with field sampled data and geosta- tistical analysis.
10,"the fitted and validated parameters of theoretical semivariograms indi- cated that, in most cases, models adjusted for soil attributes were stable (table 3). ­"
10,"ca2+, ­al3+, bs and a ­ l3+ saturation presented a pure nugget effect."
10,"this result indicates randomly distribution and spatially independent attributes, or a poor sampling scheme with low point density."
10,"high nugget values result in limited prediction capacity and they must be carefully considered in subsequent analyses (webster & oliver, 2008)."
10,"on the other hand, yield, ec in depth and c ­ ec7 had a nugget effect smaller than partial sill."
10,"yield and both electrical conductivity measurements had high range values, corresponding to 903, 792 and 748 m, respectively."
10,these results indicated that sampled variables remained correlated over long distances.
10,"the indexes related to geostatistical model’s performance presented moderated or unsat- isfactory results, depending on the variable (table 3). ­"
10,r2 and rmse indicated that models were unable to explain soil data variability in the study area.

11,"spectral signatures, from landsat satellite images, in 5 representative locations (b–g), as well as the respective infra- red color composite (rgb 543) and ndvi at different dates, representing the different maturity phases."
11,"the rgb 543 was used to was used to highlight the vegetation in the area et al. (1994), the degree of spatial dependence (dsd) was weak for sb, h + al and ph and moderate to the others."
11,"a factor influencing dsd may be the anthropic activities, which resulted in lower performance of interpolators (do amaral and justina, 2019)."
11,"corn yield assessment by remote sensing evaluating the field spectral performance on may 18th (punctual evaluation), it was observed that all representative points had the same spectral pattern (fig. 3a,b)."
11,"reflectance increased from visible to infrared bands, with higher values observed in band 6 (swir-1)."
11,demattê et al. (2005) found similar patterns for a typic oxisol in southeastern brazil.
11,the authors indicated low reflectance in the visible range (lower than 0.1) and higher values (up to 0.25) at infrared wavelengths.
11,"according to daughtry (2000), discriminating soil and crop residue may be a challenging task, especially when working with multispectral sensors."
11,"in this case, it is highly recommended to use a high spectral equipment associ- ated with high spectral resolution, i.e., hyperspectral sensors."
11,the composite image (spatial evaluation) was predominantly blue (fig. 3) and most likely corresponded to a mixture of crop residue and bare soil.
11,"this was already expected, once those plants were still in early germination stages and could not be detected by a 30 m resolution image."
11,pink color 13
12,precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 1391 patterns in the image were related to emerging seedlings or weed.
12,the ndvi map had the same spatial distribution of the rgb composition (fig. 3b).
12,"the index remained below 0.4 in eastern side of the image, indicating the presence of crop residue (demattê et al., 2018)."
12,"at the northwestern side, values are below 0.23 reinforcing the predominance of a mix- ture between bare soil and crop residue."
12,"the subsequente image corresponded to june 9th, which represented corn at v6 stage (fig. 3c)."
12,"spectral patterns at the reference points was typical of vegetation, with low reflectance at the visible spectrum (specially at blue and red), higher values observed at nir band and a downward trend towards swir bands."
12,"this is confirmed by the composite image, which had predominant pink coloring and purple- colored spots."
12,"the composite and ndvi had a heterogeneous spatial pattern, with vegeta- tions index reaching values of 0.91."
12,"plant development is higher at the northeast portion of the site, where it is possible to notice the dark purple (r5g4b3) or green (ndvi) spots."
12,"such spatial patterns are observed during the whole season and indicate better soil condi- tions and higher yield (fig. 3a,c)."
12,"satellite image from july 5th corresponded to the crop at v8 stage, when plants were at maximum vegetative growth and photosynthetic activity (fig. 3d)."
12,"plant spectral sig- nature was similar to the previous date, except for a higher reflectance in nir (band 5) at the points 4 and 5."
12,"according to taiz et al. (2017), healthier plants reflect more energy in the near-infrared region (taiz et al., 2017)."
12,"this fact was in agreement with our yield maps, which indicated higher values exactly at points 4 and 5 (fig. 3a)."
12,the composite image only differs from the previous date by the contrasting and more intense red tones observed at northeast of the site.
12,such pattern is observed at later dates and persisted until the har- vesting (after august 06th).
12,"ndvi maps followed the same spatial pattern, with higher values at points 4 and 5."
12,these findings corroborate to the fact that vegetations indexes are directly related to plant health and indicate that this data was a relevant variable for corn yield monitoring.
12,"results from july 21st were quite similar to the previous date, with minor differences in bands 6 and 7, especially when comparing spectra from higher productivity locations with the other ones (fig. 3a,e)."
12,"the swir region is influenced by leaf water content and minor variations might result in expressive changes in swir, which is explained by the logarith- mic relationship indicated by ceccato et al."
12,(2001).
12,"as previously described, productiv- ity was significantly correlated to aluminum content and saturation (fig. 2), which has direct influence on plant roots development."
12,"plants with lower productivity were limited by aluminum toxicity and due to the less developed root system, so they were not capable to explore all the available soil moisture content, especially during dry season."
12,"as a result, plants located at the points 1,2 and 3 had less water accumulated in leaf tissue and pre- sented a distinct spectral pattern in bands 6 and 7 (fig. 3e) during july 21st and august 6th (fig. 3e,f)."
12,"the image composite, ndvi and corn spectra were significantly different on august 06th (fig. 3f)."
12,composite image reached a dark opaque red and ndvi had an overall decrease to less than 0.57.
12,"spectra had a decrease in nir reflectance and an increase in red, swir 1 and 2 bands."
12,these changes are explained by the crop phenological stage.
12,the reproductive period has ended and the crop changes to the maturation stage.
12,"at this condi- tion, leaf loses photosynthetic efficiency due to the decrease in tissues pigments and nutri- ents, becoming chlorotic and dry (pinter et al., 2003)."
12,"in addition, leaf cells degrade which explains the reduction of the nir reflection (knipling, 1970)."
12,"the temporal variation of ndvi during the corn cycle has the same pattern of other calculated indexes, including evi, nbr2 and savi (fig."
12,"indexes increase in the first month due to vegetative growth, after that they stabilize and finally decrease in the last 13"

13,4 temporal variability of vegetation indexes during the period from may to august 2014.
13,the box- plot and the bar graph were created with all the pixels of the satellite images in the study site.
13,the boxplot represents the variation of the data for each vegetation index.
13,"and the bar graph represents the correlation between the vegetation index and the maize yield month, due to corn maturation (pinter et al., 2003)."
13,"differences in the monthly averages of all vegetation indexes (fig. 4) indicates a better discrimination between bare soil/crop residue and vegetation by the evi, with values ranging from 0.5 (in season beginning and end) to 2.5 (during corn vegetative stages)."
13,"evi is able to attenuate soil and atmos- phere effects on the image, being more sensitive to areas with high biomass and there- fore responding better to phenological changes than other indexes (alvino et al., 2020; justice et al., 1998)."
13,"savi also had great variability, especially between vegetative stages (fig."
13,"the index reached values greater than 1 during june and july, remaining above 0.5 until the end of the harvest."
13,nbr2 is commonly used for fire monitoring and few studies evaluated its use in crop monitoring.
13,"the index calculation relies on nir and swir bands, which are strongly related to water content in plant tissue."
13,"once it is influenced by plant water, nbr2 is an interesting option when evaluating crop water stress."
13,"in our study, it presented the low- est values throughout the harvest, staying below 0.5 during the whole evaluated period."
13,"although nbr2 did not present great variations in the average monthly values, the index had the higher correlations with corn yield (0.75; fig."
13,"these correlations are calculated from all matching pixels for each date, which means that higher correlations also indicate a better spatial agreement between the vegetation index and yield maps."
13,"as mentioned before, one of the limiting factors in the site was aluminum toxicity and the poor development of the corn root system."
13,"therefore, the limited capacity of plants to access soil moisture could explain why nbr2 (an index directly related to plant water content) had the best capacity to describe crop productivity."
14,"precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 1393 just as nbr2, the evi, ndvi and savi had positive correlations with productiv- ity (fig."
14,"the coefficient increased with vegetative development, reaching higher values on july 05th and 21st (0.72 to 0.75)."
14,"these dates corresponded to v8/v9 stages and are in agreement with vian et al. (2018), which also had the highest correlations with yield in such stages."
14,"according to these authors, vegetation indexes retrieved from v5 to v8 provide the best results for site-specific management."
14,"in fact, this is the reason why was selected july 05th indexes to compose the rs-1 and rs-1-ec datasets in management zones design."
14,"different from the other indexes, tvdi had negative correlation with corn yield, i.e., the higher the index, the lower the productivity (fig."
14,"tvdi ranged from 0.22 to 0.83 in the harvest, being lower on july 21st and higher on may 18th and august 22nd."
14,higher correlation was observed on august 6 (-0.58).
14,"this trend of higher humidity in the final dates associated with higher yields for this area has been previously revealed by the swir 1 and 2 bands and can be veri- fied again, since these epochs correspond to the pods and grains formation and filling."
14,the optical and thermal properties measured by remote sensing were compared to corn yield by establishing an evaporative triangle and performing a graphical evaluation between tvdi and ndvi.
14,"in this case, soil–plant interactions and their impact on corn yield were better evaluated (fig."
14,"lower ndvi values were observed on the left side of the graph (fig. 5a), indicating the presence of bare soil, crop residue and very stressed or senescent plants."
14,"different water availability is represented in the y-axis, where wet conditions are located in the upper-side of the triangle, while dry conditions remain in the lower-side."
14,"in gen- eral, the increase on ndvi is followed by a decrease in tvdi."
14,"according to schirmbeck et al, (2017), the ndvi is an indicative of vegetation exuberance."
14,"high ndvi values refer to vigor- ous plants, while low values are associated with stressed plants."
14,field regions with stressed plants have higher temperatures and higher values of tvdi are also observed.
14,these changes in the indices are noticeable throughout the harvest (fig. 5a).
14,"on may 18th and august 22nd, the highest tvdi (around 0.8) and lower ndvi (0.2–0.3) were observed due to absent or very low biomass, which increased the surface temperature."
14,"as the corn grows and biomass increases, plants partially cover the soil (ndvi > 0.5), evapotranspiration increases, while sur- face temperature and tvdi decrease (< 0.5) (fig."
14,"the largest tvdis belonged to the regions with the lowest productivity (fig. 5b), although these points reached high ndvi (up to 0.85, in the case of july 5th)."
14,this indicates that tvdi could be more sensitive to changes in vegetation than ndvi.
14,"besides that, the most productive areas had lower dryness index."
14,"the relationship between productivity and the dryness index has already been used to estimate yield and had a better performance than ndvi (holzman & rivas, 2016; holzman et al., 2018)."
14,"in our study, tvdi was not the best index to describe corn yield."
14,"this can be related to the lower spatial resolution of thermal bands (100 m), while optical bands are represented by 30 m pixel."
14,another important aspect influencing tvdi is the difficulty to establish the dry and wet edges from graphical analyses.
14,"errors in this step are common and the parameters can under or overestimate the tvdi values (sandholt et al., 2002)."
14,"to reduce this uncertainty, some automatic models are proposed, such as the one elab- orated by chen et al."
14,(2020).
14,although sandholt et al. (2002) recognize the difficulty involved in the process and the need for several observations to properly determine the isolines.
14,"relation between soil management zones and corn yield in general, the variables in each dataset were correlated and the indexes were temporally and spatially similar."
14,"to reduce the information redundancy, principal component analy- sis was conducted in each dataset."

15,"and on july 5th, corresponding to v8 stage (b) for each yield class 91% of the data variance."
15,"measurements at both depths had equal weights in this com- ponent, but the superficial contributed positively while the other negatively."
15,"for the soil dataset, the first two pcs represented more than 80% of variance and were the only ones used in cluster analysis."
15,"carbon content influenced pc1 (loading around 0.5), while pc2 is best represented by aluminum content (0.4), cec and bases (− 0.43)."
15,"for si 1 and si 1-ec, only pc1 was used and it was strongly influenced by lst data, with negative loading (-0.7)."
15,"for si 2 and ec-si2, the components 1, 2 and 3 were considered and vegetation indexes, including tvdi, are clearly discriminated by pc2."
15,"on pc1, the image date resulted in different loadings."
15,"the increase in electrical con- ductivity in si does not seem to have strongly influenced the main components, which reflected in the zoning results."
15,"after selecting which pcs would be used in the different zonings, they cluster analy- sis was applied."
15,"in all situations, the best number of clusters was 2, as indicated by pc and pe (fig."

16,"this could be explained by the higher spatial res- olution of satellite images, which unlike the other datasets were not interpolated (fig. 7g), a process that usually result in smooth transitions."
16,there was a negligible difference between using images from july 05th and from the whole harvest.
16,"in addition, electrical conductiv- ity did not add information to the zoning, as previously indicated by pca."
16,"to define the datasets that resulted in representative zones, i.e., which information improved the design of yield-limiting zones, were analyzed the mzs and yield map by the wilcoxon mann whitney test and pairwise wilcox test (table 4)."
16,"in this case, significant results (p < 0.05) indicated which resulting mzs were different from each other."
16,"the ec, s and si 1-ec datasets showed no significant difference between their resulting clusters, showing that they were not able to group the field adequately."

17,"therefore, this was the best zoning, as it was more similar to the productivity variation."
17,the results confirm the potential of using spectral data in crop fields as an alternative to access spatio-temporal variability of management zones.
17,"this type of information does not depend on soil sampling and laboratory analysis, reducing costs and overcoming field work (molin & tavares, 2019)."
17,"in addition, the soil data in this case required spatialization, an extra step that depends on the sample density to be satisfactory."
17,"conclusions the study site presented a considerable variability of soil chemical attributes, especially ph, bases saturation and aluminum content."
17,"this variability influenced the crop develop- ment and yield, which was correctly detected by remote sensors."
17,"correlations between veg- etation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for nbr2, but evi, savi and ndvi also presented good results (r > 0.7)."
17,"although tvdi presented lower correlations, the evaluation of the evaporative triangle provided relevant insights about the field spatio- temporal variability."
17,this was only possible due to the capacity of remote sensors detect- ing land surface temperature and the direct relation of such information with crop energy balance and consequently evapotranspiration.
17,"besides the different indexes, another factor with great influence on corn monitoring is the plant phenological stage."
17,"according to our results, the vegetative stage v8 (july 5th) resulted in higher correlations between vegeta- tion indexes and corn yield."
17,"these results indicate that soil conditions can be indirectly evaluated by remote sensing data and methodologies capable of associating the electro- magnetic radiation reflected or emitted by plant canopy (i.e., spectrum) and plant health conditions."
17,"the electrical conductivity was significantly correlated to soil chemical attributes, espe- cially ph and bases saturation (r = 0.76)."
17,"locations with higher ec also presented higher ph, bs and lower m%, while areas with lower ec were the least productive due to soil chemical limitations for plant development."
17,"although ec was correlated to soil, analysis showed that management zones designed solely by electrical conductivity did not result in partitions with significantly different yields."
17,"on the other hand, mzs had the best agree- ment with yield when zones were based solely on vegetation index from corn v8 phe- nological stage."
17,"these results are related to the capacity of rs to generate information at higher density (30 m spatial resolution), while field sampling in precision agriculture usu- ally considers one point every 2–3 ha."
17,"therefore, our results indicate the great potential of 13"
18,precision agriculture (2023) 24:1380–1400 1397 remote sensing to generate good quality and dense data for evaluating corn variability and to define adequate management zones.
18,"further studies should focus on the use of thermal data for mzs design, once that such information has been proved to be directly to plant water stress."
