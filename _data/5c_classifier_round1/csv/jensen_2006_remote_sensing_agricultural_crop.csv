2,the goal of this project was to assist the republic of south africa department of water affairs & forestry to identify a cost-effective remote sensing methodology to accurately measure and monitor agricultural land use for national water act water management purposes.
2,the most accurate results were obtained using object-oriented image segmentation techniques applied to spot multispectral and panchromatic data (overall accuracy = 89.41%).
2,accurate classifications were also obtained using just the spot multispectral data (85.33%).
2,"when applied to landsat etm+ and tm data in 2003 and 2005, the image segmentation approach out-performed all other algorithms yielding classification accuracies of 85.71% and 84. 30%, respectively."
2,"this is important because landsat tm type data cover more geography (e.g., 185 x 185 km) than 2 spot data (e.g., 60 x 60 km) and are more economical per km ."
2,these findings are of value to the republic of south africa as well as other countries throughout africa that are trying to implement national water acts that rely on remote sensing to provide some of the critical land cover information.
2,"introduction to the registered water use the majority of the country is semi-arid with an average problem in developing countries annual rainfall of 497 mm, a rate well below the world average of 860 mm (walmsley, 1991)."
2,low precipitation the european space agency’s tiger 2004 workshop in and high evaporation rates result in low available runoff.
2,"pretoria, republic of south africa reported that only 8.6% of the rainfall is available as surface water, approximately 3.5 million african children die of water- resulting in one of the lowest conversion rates in the world related causes each year."
2,"the major causes include: no (asmal, 1998)."
2,"nearly two-thirds of the country receives access to potable water, drinking polluted water, too much less than the national rainfall average and about 20% receives water (e.g., flooding), and lack of food due to drought or < 200 mm."

3,"therefore, one of the greatest challenges in developing countries is to identify the geographic location methodology of “actual water users,” and compare this information with “registered water users” information."
3,the goal of the project was to investigate various digital the republic of south africa allowed all water users to image processing algorithms to inventory the type and spatial register their water use from 1996-1998.

4,"the in situ ground reference information was also used to perform an unbiased, quantitative land cover classification accuracy assessment."
4,remote sensor data collection many of the agricultural fields in the usutu and mhlathuze river water management area are < 100 ha.
4,"therefore, it was necessary to utilize remote sensing imagery with a spatial resolution of ≤ 30 x 30 m to identify the crop type within such small fields."
4,"sensors like modis (nasa), meris (esa) and avhrr (noaa) were of no value due to their coarse spatial resolutions (e.g., 250 m, 300 m, and 1100 m, respectively)."
4,"utilizing crop calendar information, dwaf obtained the following remote sensor data (dwaf, 2005): • march 26, 2003 landsat 7 enhanced thematic + mapper-plus (etm ) image: o multispectral bands 1-5, 7 at 30 × 30 m; panchromatic band 8 at 15 × 15 m."

4,landsat 5 data were obtained in 2005 instead of + landsat 7 etm data because the landsat 7 sensor was experiencing serious scan-line correction problems.

5,"therefore, it is necessary to identify agricultural classification is performed and no attempt is being made to fields and quantify their area in order to determine the water measure biophysical variables [e.g., leaf-area-index (lai) use for a specific irrigation method and crop type."
5,"the or absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (apar)]. irrigation methods and crop types will have to be determined others suggest that all remote sensor data should be scaled from a combination of remote sensing and actual field to percent reflectance (e.g., values form 0 - 100%)."

5,dwaf would be pleased if they can identify field this study examined numerous image classification algorithms boundaries (polygons) as opposed to per-pixel classification using both: in a semi-automated manner.
6,while at first it might seem a simple matter to discriminate information.
6,"it is clear from figures 2 and 3 that information fields of citrus, banana, vegetables, and sugarcane from all extraction algorithm(s) applied to this study area should other land cover classes using remote sensor data, it is not probably take into account texture and incorporate (thompson, 2004; dwaf, 2005)."
6,"unlike many crops, information on the row and orientation structure of plantation sugarcane is not planted in a single month (e.g., november) agriculture."
6,"the algorithm(s) must also be able to extract and then harvested some months later (e.g., march)."
6,"rather, information from relatively small, irregularly shaped fields sugarcane can be planted year-round in this subtropical associated with indigenous agriculture."
6,this can be environment and has an 18-month growth cycle.
6,"this means accomplished by subjecting the spectral and/or panchromatic that in any given month sugarcane can be recorded in 18 remote sensor data to texture extraction algorithms such as different stages of development in the imagery ranging from “homogeneity” based on gray-scale spatial dependency bare soil, to newly established seedlings with substantial matrices (jensen, 2005)."
6,"in addition, more accurate bare ground, to a mature canopy with 100% closure just agricultural information may be obtained if both spectral prior to harvest. and contextual characteristics are used in the classification conversely, citrus crops go through a very long growth process."
6,"this may be accomplished using object-oriented cycle, often lasting 10-20 years."

8,"each original remote sensing dataset was first unmixing” with user-defined targets (williams and hunt, decomposed into several perfectly registered datasets with 2002)."
8,the reflectance data for each date (6 bands for 2003 11
9,and 2005 landsat data and 4 bands for 2004 spot data) were processed using a minimum noise fraction (mnf) transformation.
9,examination of the eigenvalues and the spatial information contained in the mnf transformed images suggested that all mnf transforms be used in the analysis.
9,visual interpretation allowed extraction of reference point samples for each land cover class from the three dates of imagery using the high spatial resolution orthophotos and the polygonal ground reference data created from the orthophotographs.
9,these samples were then compared to pure pixels derived using a pixel purity index (ppi) analysis of the mnf imagery in n-dimensional feature space (scatterplots).
9,this resulted in two or three pixels to be regarded as pure endmember for each land cover class from the three dates of mnf imagery.
9,the image- derived endmembers were then used in the mtmf analysis.
9,"the output from the mtmf analysis was a dataset consisting of score images showing the relative subpixel abundance of each land cover class, and infeasibility images."
9,"ideally, pixels with a high score value and a low infeasibility value have a high percent cover of each land cover, while those with high infeasibility values were not classified as the corresponding land cover."
9,"pixels with high score values and high infeasibility values may be false alarms, therefore, they were rejected."
9,"most of the study area was sugarcane, citrus, and bushveld, while banana, paw-paw, and vegetable occupied small portions of the study area."
9,"this a prior knowledge allowed figure 4 examples of a portion of the 2004 spot data processed using object- weights to be applied to the major land cover oriented image segmentation. a) level 10 image segmentation. b) level 25 classes by assigning different thresholds of image segmentation, c) level 40 image segmentation, and d) level 60 image segmentation. infeasibility to each land cover (i.e., allow higher infeasibility values for sugarcane and citrus, and limit minor classes to low infeasibility values)."
9,"using these thresholds, each pixel was assigned the land cover class having the highest score."
9,it was also possible to make maps showing the proportion of any endmember in each pixel which can be of value.
9,"results and discussion selected digital image processing algorithms + were used to classify land cover in landsat etm , spot, and landsat tm data in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively."
