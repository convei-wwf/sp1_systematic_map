1,introduction 1.1.
1,boreal wetlands and remote sensing wetlands in canadian boreal regions come in many sizes and forms.
1,"these wetlands typically develop where the water table is at or near the surface, allowing water to settle, promoting development of soil conditions for hydrophytic vegetation [1]."
1,"the majority of canada’s 150 million hectares of wetlands are found in the boreal region, where rates of forest disturbance in 2008 were found to be approximately 78%, among the highest in the world [2]."
1,"natural resources development, agricultural land cover change, and drying from warmer climate conditions are all contributing to disturbances in remote sens. 2019, 11, 161; doi:10.3390/rs11020161 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing"
2,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 2 of 24 the boreal zone."
2,"with increasing disturbance and changes to local hydrology, accurate, high resolution spatiotemporal classification of these boreal wetlands is required for understanding rates of boreal wetland change, many of which have yet to be accurately identified or mapped."
2,"moreover, drying trends in many northern regions of canada and the united states have been observed in recent decades, where changes in ground and surface water hydrology have been observed."
2,"in addition, natural cycles, vegetation type, and flooding lack comprehensive understanding through ineffective monitoring and/or documentation."
2,"lowering of the water table results in increasing shrub succession into wetlands in some years, and altering of the carbon balance [3–6]."
2,"wetland succession has been observed within localized plots and sampling areas, however, it is logistically difficult to measure these processes across broad regions."
2,"due to these changes, there is a need to develop remote sensing classification procedures that provide a high-resolution baseline of contemporary wetland characteristics and the potential for automated mapping of temporal changes."
2,"remote sensing offers the potential to continuously map wetland and water extents [7,8] inundated vegetation, and associated water permanencies at regional scales."
2,"for boreal wetland studies, early remote sensing applications commonly utilized passive multispectral optical imagery as a foundational data source from which identify and map wetland features and extents."
2,"the capture of optical information across multiple wavelengths provides the spectral separation of distinguishing features common in wetland ecosystems, such as water and different vegetation conditions and species [9,10]."
2,"however, the passive nature of such systems (i.e., detection of (typically solar) radiation reflected from the target) make them ineffective during cloudy conditions and/or under low-light conditions [11]."
2,"more recently, active sensors such as light detection and ranging (lidar) and synthetic aperture radar (sar) have been recognized as valuable tools for wetland mapping by remote sensing."
2,lidar is commonly employed for high resolution three-dimensional mapping of terrain and terrestrial ecosystems.
2,"lidar has been commonly utilized for the identification of terrain depressions, to identify probabilistic wetland locations (given gravitational gradients remain unaffected by external mechanisms)."
2,"moreover, lidar data have recently been applied in wetland classification techniques with reasonable success [7]."
2,"lidar’s active nature enables penetration into, and through, vegetation canopies, and thus allows the measurement of within canopy structure and terrain features below—key for distinguishing different wetland classes."
2,"however, lidar typically acquires data in a single wavelength (most commonly 1064 nm), although state-of-the-art systems allow the simultaneous acquisition of up to 3 bands (optech titan)."
2,the 1064 nm waveband is often absorbed by water and can provide analytical challenges in open water environments.
2,"conversely, sar is useful for surface water and flooded vegetation mapping, due to the contrast and reflectivity between land and water associated with the high dielectric constant of water [12–14]."
2,"multi-temporal sar data series are comparable to (cloud-free acquisitions from) optical sensor for wetland detection, largely because sar is unaffected by cloud cover and other atmospheric effects [15]."
2,"like lidar, sar can penetrate vegetation canopies to provide information on beneath canopy flooding."
2,"this is achieved, in part, from multi-polarized sar data, which present the opportunity to decompose imagery backscatter information into scattering mechanisms, allowing a better understanding of wetland flood extent [14]."
2,"whilst individual remote sensing data have demonstrated success for wetland mapping, it is comprehensively recognized that data fusion methods using multiple remote sensing sources provide improved information on wetland hydrological, vegetation, and topographic attributes that are important identifiers of wetland characteristics [16,17]."
2,"for example, irwin et al. [18] noted the use of high-resolution worldview-2 data, combined with lidar and sar, reduced water surface extent uncertainties by 11% on average."
2,millard et al. [19] noted improved accuracy of wetland extent mapping and wetland type classification when combining lidar and sar data over individual data source analysis.
2,"as imaging sensors become increasingly advanced and data sharing trends are moving toward more open source distribution, there are opportunities for combining multiple"
3,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 3 of 24 data types through data fusion, to monitor and characterize unique environments that remain to be fully understood."
3,"the objective of this study is to examine remote sensing decision-based approaches to enhance the ability to classify and quantify important boreal wetlands and attributes, including (a) wetland extent and type; (b) water extent and change through time; and (c) extent of flooded vegetation so that the methods can be repeated within a long-term monitoring framework."
3,"this is performed using data fusion of (1) topographic attributes from lidar, (2) surface water hydroperiod from sar, and (3) vegetation structural attributes from lidar and optical remote sensing data."
3,"results are compared with field validation data, allowing error of omission, and to also be investigated using data fusion to increase overall accuracies and enable complex quantification of boreal wetland attributes."
3,"study area the research focuses on two subareas in alberta (figure 1a): a ~20 km × 20 km subset of the utikuma regional study area (ursa) region (figure 1b), including only areas of heterogeneous wetland and till moraine uplands (excluding the clay plains region); and a ~25 km × 25 km area of the peace-athabasca delta (pad) (figure 1c)."
3,the subarea found within the pad was identified to test the applicability of remote sensing fusion classification conducted at ursa.
3,"it should be noted the shrub (salix sp.) and graminoid dominant vegetation composition at pad is different from that at ursa, which is more heavily treed and subject to less extreme surface water fluctuations."
3,the difference in canopy density at each site is also an important consideration with respect to determining lidar and sar signal penetration and canopy height metrics.
3,1.2.1.
3,utikuma regional study area ursa is a boreal forest region located approximately 100 km north of slave lake in the central mixedwood natural subregion [20].
3,"the ursa series of study sites covers an area of 1062 km2 surrounding utikuma lake [21], established in 1998 as a long-term monitoring site to quantify key hydrological processes associated with disturbance and regeneration, nutrient cycles, and hydro-ecological changes over time in a sub-humid environment."
3,ursa moraine complexes are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of locally topographic low-lying wetlands and peatlands separated by upland till moraine with predominantly populus tremuloides across the northwest side of the ~60 km × 20 km transect.
3,the southeast half of the transect is underlain by clay plains with large coverage of peatlands and greater development.
3,wetland ecosystems are predominantly comprised of shallow ponds with submergent macrophyte vegetation that may float on open water during summer [22].
3,"treed fens and bogs are found on poorly drained organic rich soils comprised of mainly black spruce (picea mariana) and are commonly underlain with sphagnum spp. mosses, fibric peat, grasses up to 0.5 m height, and gyttja hummocks and hollows [22]."
3,1.2.2.
3,"peace-athabasca delta the peace-athabasca delta (pad) formed at the western end of lake athabasca after the retreat of the laurentide ice sheet ~10,000 bp."
3,"isostatic rebound and sedimentation by the major peace, athabasca, and birch rivers formed deltas approximately 1680, 1970, and 170 km2 , respectively [23]."
3,"the deltas contain more than 1000 small basins (wetlands and lakes) with varying degrees of surface hydraulic connection to the main flow system, depending on location and elevation [24]."
3,"three delta basin water level regimes are present within the pad: (i) an open or active hydraulic connection with the main flow system; (ii) a restricted connection, such as a perched channel or levee entry, to an adjacent lake or river; and (iii) isolated farther inland."
3,"the water level fluctuation of the latter two types is independent of the main flow system, except when connected during high water events, and are referred to as perched basins."

5,"basins in the main portion of the delta are generally enclosed by narrow, abrupt levees that comprise a small fraction of the total area [25]."

5,both airborne lidar datasets exhibit coincidence between all sar acquisitions and field validation locations.
5,an additional multispectral titan lidar survey was flown over the pad in august 2016 in a similar configuration as noted at ursa.
5,no supplementary local geo-referencing information were acquired to support this dataset due to logistical and financial constraints.

6,"this results in enhanced hh backscattering with less increase seen in vv, therefore, quad-polarized (hh, hv, vh, vv) datasets can be used to identify flooded vegetation using polarimetric decomposition techniques [29–31]."
6,"steeper incidence angle gives better penetration into the canopy of flooded vegetation, but the steeper the angle, the more that the range is limited in fine-quad modes."
6,2.1.4.
6,ground validation a total of 6 wetlands within the study region were surveyed between 25 july and 4 august 2015.
6,"positional information was acquired to determine surface water extent (i.e., location where water touches the edge of the pond) and riparian habitat boundary transects (i.e., location where the frequency of shrubs was less than ~1 shrub per 10 m radius)."
6,"cross-sectional transects were established, extending perpendicularly away from the water’s edge and upwards from the wetlands to adjacent upland, to reflect vegetation zones and changes in vegetation community composition where prominent vegetation species were identified [8]."
6,"positions were occupied using a topcon hiper sr gnss (livermore, ca, usa) following standard kinematic survey techniques, and were differentially corrected to a static base station using precise point positioning (ppp), yielding centimeter accuracy."

7,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 7 of 24 2.2."
7,methods 2.2.1.
7,"airborne lidar processing the 2016 titan lidar point cloud was pre-processed using teledyne optech’s lidar mapping suite, where terrascan (terrasolid, helsinki, finland) and lastools [32] were utilized for post-processing."
7,"the raw (pre-processed) point cloud was tiled to a 1 km grid, with a 20 m buffer to mitigate potential edge effects."
7,"each tile was ground-classified and, subsequently, height normalized to calculate the height of each non-ground point above the identified ground surface."
7,"non-ground points were classified as low, medium, and tall vegetation, in accordance with asprs 2011 guidelines [33]."
7,"vegetation-classified points were interrogated using a 1 m search radius to determine the 99th percentile height (p99), where only points >2 m above the ground were considered, in order to negate contributions of understory vegetation; i.e., p99 is the height at which 99% of vegetation-classified points >2 m above the ground occur."
7,these heights were rasterized to a 1 m grid to yield a canopy height model (chm).
7,the removal of understory vegetation by use of a minimum height cut-off is common practice in the analysis of lidar data acquired over forest environments [34].
7,"terrascan (terrasolid, helsinki finland) and surfer (golden software, golden, co, usa) were employed to filter ground classified points and produce a 1 m × 1 m digital elevation model (dem), created using inverse distance weighting (idw) interpolation, with a 10 m search radius."
7,a common derivative from high resolution dem data is topographic position index (tpi).
7,tpi is a measure of the difference between the elevation value of a cell and the average elevation of nearby (neighboring) cells (within a defined radius) [34–37].
7,"a positive value indicates higher elevation than its surrounding, whereas negative indicates it is lower."
7,"tpi results provide the means for estimating the probability of a wetland occurring in a certain area by separating locally high and low areas, assuming gravitational drainage of surface water."
7,"for example, the probability or landscape suitability of a wetland occurring in a topographic high (upland) may be low (for broad wetland areas and excluding local topographic depressions, e.g., forested swamps)."
7,"a low tpi suggests high suitability for a wetland because surface water may flow towards depressions, therefore propagating the potential for wetland development."
7,"at ursa, sar and optical data were orthorectified to the 2008 lidar dem as it had more reliable geo-referencing information."
7,"due to the lack of local geo-referencing information, lidar data acquired at the pad exhibited small positional discrepancies, which amassed themselves as relatively large errors due to the flat nature of the region."
7,"this resulted in the pad lidar dataset exhibiting too many uncertainties to produce a robust analysis with respect to inferring lidar-based corrections; therefore, corrections with lidar were only conducted over ursa."
7,2.2.2.
7,surface water extraction and hydroperiod sar-derived surface water masks were created using an intensity (db) thresholding technique developed by white et al. [14] using pci model builder (pci geomatics).
7,the methodology was modified to extract surface water using input threshold intensity/decibel (db) range values [8].
7,"employed sar filters (software specific naming) in the pci model builder include fgamma (gamma maximum-a-posteriori (map)) adaptive filter to preserve edges, important for surface water extent analysis [37–39]; fav (averaging mean filter) to reduce speckle [40]; and fmo (mode filtering of gray-level values) to further reduce noise of the sar images [40]."
7,"spot 6 data were employed for the validation of sar water masks (all bands were used to inform on water versus land pixels), where surface water was classified using k-means unsupervised classification [41–43]."
7,"binary surface water extents (i.e., 0 as non-water, 1 as water) were produced in raster format for each available sar acquisition using hh backscatter."
7,"a measure of water permanence or hydroperiod throughout the growing season is determined using an “equals frequency” routine on the binary surface water rasters for each year, calculating the number of times a pixel is identified as water in the same geographic location."
7,the output
8,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 8 of 24 “pixel frequency” corresponds to the number of sar images/months analyzed within each year."
8,"this is reclassified from frequency to hydroperiod classes based on stewart and kantrud [44] and cowardin et al. [45]; where water present for 1–2 months represents “temporary” (s&k class ii), 3–4 months is “seasonal” (s&k class iii), and 5–6 months is “semi-permanent/permanent” (s&k classes iv and v)."
8,2.2.3.
8,"sar polarimetric decompositions for flooded vegetation the freeman–durden decomposition (fdd) [46] was used to create a three-channel composite raster that estimates the contribution of surface (water or rough surface), double-bounce (flooded), and volume (tall/forested vegetation) scattering response to the total backscatter from each pixel in an image."
8,"the double-bounce (flooded vegetation) band was isolated, and null values removed to represent only positive values in the double-bounce backscatter [31,40,47]."
8,"to remove speckle, a 5 × 5 boxcar filter (pci geomatica) was applied, based on local pixel averaging [29]."
8,2.2.4.
8,"topographic position index tpi is scale dependent based on the topographic morphology of the land surface (defined by surface geology), therefore, the user needs to select parameters (e.g., window search radius) appropriate for the study area."
8,"in order to determine the optimal search radius, multiple iterations ranging from 50 m to 500 m were tested."
8,"optimal radii was selected based on (1) the high resolution of the data, (2) topography criteria outlined by jenness [48], and (3) circular moving polynomial windows based on the round shape and width of upland till moraines between the wetlands in the area [7]."
8,"the range of window sizes, selected to test tpi suitability to the landscape, were based on where the “normal” maximum occurs in the surface water."
8,"isolated outlier wetland pixels from the hydroperiod analysis, located on plateaus, were manually identified and masked out, creating an adjusted hydroperiod from the tpi."
8,2.2.5.
8,"decision-based workflow a decision-based methodology was developed to derive wetland ecosystem attributes that expands upon an earlier method developed by chasmer et al. [7,16] who based classification on topographic position and vegetation canopy attributes from lidar and worldview-2 spectra [16], and lidar-based intensity and structure [7]."
8,variation in hydroperiod and impact on wetland aquatic transitional vegetation was performed using sar.
8,"water permanence and presence of flooded vegetation integration, in fusion with lidar, follows findings by white et al. [40], and brisco et al. [49] regarding the spatial distribution of wetland attributes."
8,"the decision-based methodology includes deriving sar (single pol) water masks, associated hydroperiod classified according to stewart and kantrud [44], and the government of alberta [50], flooded vegetation from sar (quad pol) fdd decomposition and, lastly, lidar-derived topographic index and canopy cover attributes."
8,"the methodology is broken into four different stages: (1) surface water extraction using intensity thresholding [14], and hydroperiod analysis [8]; (2) flooded vegetation using fdd decomposition [31]; (3) lidar topographic attributes [7], and tpi [48]; and (4) data fusion of all attributes, enabling quality-controlled wetland ecosystem products."
8,"the combination of each dataset acts as a quality control measure, high resolution wetland classification system, and creates an integrated, dynamic wetland product with potential monitoring implications."

18,"while optical data can be trained and classified to provide some measure of interpreted accuracy, the process is still largely determined by delineation conducted by the operator."
18,boundary delineation of vegetation and water extent
19,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 19 of 24 in some wetlands are also subjective."
19,"crasto et al. [55] discuss how criteria outlined by jahn and dunne [56] influence remote sensing feature detection, due to bias during digitization that is often influenced by experience and interpretations that are subjective [57]."
19,all validation data were collected by the same individual in the field and areas were digitized by the same operator.
19,manual surveys of flooded vegetation boundaries were not conducted due to access and time limitations.
19,"therefore, these areas could not be validated to the same degree as less saturated riparian areas, but the decomposition methodology has been well documented and studied for quality control in a variety of environments [31,46,58,59]."
19,"any combination of uncertainties may contribute to discrepancies in the overall accuracy of the classification, and this highlights the importance of reliable ground validation data when working in logistically challenging regions."
19,"implications for wetland classification while many studies focus on mapping known permanent waterbodies, this study differs by utilizing high spatial and temporal resolution information to create dynamic surface water and riparian vegetation thematic maps."
19,"data availability is the most important aspect when attempting to characterize non-permanent wetlands, requiring increased temporal resolution and field measurements that represent the natural ranges in hydrological conditions."
19,the results of this study suggest that these criteria can be met by products of the decision-based methodology presented (figures 8–10).
19,"the methodology presented should also be useful for the identification of marsh and swamp wetlands with associated open water areas, while wet areas within fens can be identified using laser return intensity and other spectral indices that are related to the absorption of electromagnetic wavelengths by water [7,16], especially within peatland (treed fen/bog) environments."
19,"for example, boolean statements can be implemented to determine if an area is a swamp: e.g., (1) “if” trees are present and topography is low-lying (tpi) then high potential for a swamp; (2) “if” the surface water level is above the dem then high potential for a swamp; (3) “if” no open water is present and flooded vegetation is present then more likely a swamp or fen."
19,"however, “if” statements require calibration, which is locally dependent."
19,"absence of these statements in the current methodology is a limitation, but they should be explored and integrated in further studies to provide a more complete classification system for boreal wetlands."
19,future work may also investigate scattering returns from volume scattering that intersect with areas of surface water at certain times of the year to provide an indication of species type.
19,"for example, some emergent hydrophytic vegetation, such as cattail and bulrush, tend to grow later in the growing season (july–august) in areas where soil was saturated in earlier months."
19,"therefore, identifying the areas with transition from open water to double-bounce flooded vegetation and, lastly, volume scattering, could be an excellent indicator of these larger, slow growing species."
19,data limitations and potential sources of error a limitation of the study relates to temporal image frequency of both sar and lidar data.
19,increased temporal resolution will better represent short-term variations.
19,"the canadian c-band radarsat constellation mission (rcm), expected to launch in february 2019, will offer advanced capabilities for monitoring surface water with high spatial resolution modes such as spotlight, providing enhanced monitoring of smaller wetlands [60]."
19,"as the provincial lidar database and coverage in alberta expands and is updated, there is a growing opportunity to integrate temporal lidar datasets into wetland monitoring and enhance the understanding of precipitation variation influences, anthropogenic and climate change on surface water and wetland vegetation change."
19,working over broad regions and in relatively remote areas like the ursa region makes it logistically difficult to collect ground validation across all wetland environments.
19,"since classifiers or ranges for sar-derived surface water masks are variable between images and acquisition, there is a need to calibrate the intensity threshold (db) for each image to consistently extract all true open water returns from an image [14], as well as instrument calibration and ground conditions [61]."
20,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 20 of 24 another limitation of this approach is found in the fine resolution used in the large spatial area."
20,"subtle changes in riparian vegetation on the order of <2 m are difficult to extract with certainty, due to homogeneity of many of the riparian vegetation communities."
20,"while it is easy to determine high and low topographical areas, and high, medium, and low vegetation canopy, it is difficult to discriminate between species."
20,"for example, while it may be important to examine species encroachment or succession, the difference between a patch of 2 m tall willow trees and 2 m tall birch trees is challenging due to similarities in structure, therefore, it was found to be more convenient to group these similar canopy environments."
20,"this is detailed in figure 7a,b and figure 8, where both elevation and canopy height are somewhat ambiguous, likely as a result of the general flatness of topography and sporadic woody vegetation regeneration in clearings and meadows."
20,"shadow effects in the sar ascending and descending images can cause classification errors along some forested boundaries, but quality control data were not available within this study, so the extent (if at all) of such shadow-induced errors in low-lying riparian areas of the ursa study area is unknown."
20,see kropatsch [62] for details and methods to reduce error associated with shadowing.
20,"when using sar to derive surface water compared to other sensors, occasional omission of surface water bodies that are narrow or have mixed pixels (such as watercourses and fen pond boundaries), has been documented in shallow riparian areas [13]."
20,"this may be a potential source of error in many boreal wetlands, where these boundary areas are mostly classified as land due to the unique scattering properties."
20,hydrological connectivity of wetlands is of key interest to hydrologists and multi-temporal sar imagery may provide an indication of hydrological connectivity due to periodic saturation and the growth of certain species.
20,this may not be topographically related as the water can move underground in peat.
20,"it has implications for contaminant transport, downstream flooding, and ecosystem change."
20,"surface water modeling would also be enhanced by delineating water extent and elevation from lidar, which can also provide further high-resolution comparative data to both optical and sar-derived surface water masks, adding utility to the wetland classification [55,63]."
20,"conclusions the presented methodology offers a new time series-based boreal wetland classification approach using data fusion of multiple remote sensing data sources, based on hydroperiod, topography and vegetation attributes."
20,"the results of this study indicate water mask frequency analysis can be used to determine hydroperiod and permanence in boreal environments, similarly to prairie environments, with overall accuracies of 93% to 97.2% and kappa values of 0.8–0.9% when compared to optical data."
20,"concordance results comparing semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 was found to be 98.3% correlated, suggesting there is very little change in open water extent in these wetlands between the two years."
20,a longer time series would need to be used to determine if this is a consistent relationship given the climate cycles [20].
20,"regression analysis of field and model riparian and surface water extents from six wetlands also yielded high accuracies (r2 = 0.9), suggesting the decision-based methodology could be applied to similar open water boreal wetlands with some certainty."
20,"the time-intensive and potential limiting factor of the methodology is the expertise required in data preparation for multiple types of data (lidar, sar, optical)."
20,"however, once the data preparation and foundation for data fusion has been conducted, additional data can readily be integrated and processed in the workflow."
20,"while there are limitations associated with data availability and frequency, the strength of the study is the ability to construct and examine meaningful comprehensive wetland characterization products conforming to provincial guidelines set forth by the american wetland classification system and the canadian wetland classification system."
20,future research using a logic-based decision-based methodology would benefit from identifying additional topographic and vegetative attributes at a higher resolution to increase class reliability.
20,sar and optical data to compliment lidar data describing riparian vegetation communities would further enhance the hydroperiod analysis for a more comprehensive wetland classification and monitoring framework.
20,this framework could be largely automated through machine learning algorithms and
21,"remote sens. 2019, 11, 161 21 of 24 would provide a platform for land use permitting, reclamation monitoring, and wetland regulation in remote boreal regions of alberta."
