1,kennedy once said: “there are risks and costs to action.
1,but they are far less distributed under the terms and than the long-range risks of comfortable inaction” (adler 2003).

2,"laws 2022, 11, 48 2 of 18 2007)."
2,"by estimating the partial coi of ghg emissions from land conversions, officials may find that inaction is more expensive than action to reduce climate-change risks."
2,"omission of ghg emissions from land conversions can result in significant coi, which can hinder vt’s mitigation and adaptation plans and result in climate crisis-related consequences (e.g., credit downgrade, increase in vulnerability to lawsuits)."
2,"in order to quantify coi, it is important to estimate the social costs of emissions (e.g., sc-co2 ) that occur from land conversions in the absence of any regulatory policy."
2,"since emissions can cause various environmental, economic, and societal consequences, a differentiation is frequently made between tangible, intangible, direct, and indirect damages (nicklin et al."
2,2019).
2,the role of soils in the vermont global warming solutions act (gwsa) the state of vt seeks to achieve 80% reduction below the 1990 ghg emissions by 2050 (general assembly of the state of vermont 2020) for energy-related emissions only with specific initiatives outlined in the initial climate action plan (vermont climate council 2021).
2,vermont is a participant in the u.s.
2,"climate alliance, a group of 25 states which have agreed to reduce ghg emissions in support of the paris agreement and united nations sustainable development goals (united nations 2015; keestra et al."
2,2016).
2,the gwsa (2020) authorizes evaluating each ghg emission source or category of sources and identifying programs and strategies that could result in the most significant and cost- effective reductions in ghg emissions (general assembly of the state of vermont 2020).
2,it also requires developing actions to increase carbon storage in forest and agricultural soils (general assembly of the state of vermont 2020).
2,"despite identifying soils as a possible carbon sink, the current gswa does not identify soil ghg emissions from land conversions, which could pose a potential liability to vt’s government for inadequate action in the face of climate change (klein 2015)."
2,"vermont’s pedodiversity (the state’s soil composition) determines the soil regulating ecosystem services/disservices (es/ed) potential regarding its capacity to release or store co2 and the vulnerability to climate change (table 1, figure 1) (mikhailova et al. 2021a)."
2,"vermont has six soil orders, which belong to slightly weathered (entisols, inceptisols, histosols), moderately weathered (alfisols, mollisols), and strongly weathered (spodosols) soils with various soil c storages and climate-change vulnerabilities."

12,"our study used this plan to demonstrate how soil and land cover analysis can identify and track emission sources (e.g., co2 emissions hotspots associated with land cover change) and understand how land cover change has and may impact ghg emissions."
12,"initial vermont climate action plan the vermont greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecast (1990–2017) (depart- ment of environmental conservation 2021), states that it is challenging to quantify carbon fluxes from soils, land uses, land-use change, and forestry because of the complexity asso- ciated with land use and land-use change systems and components."
12,our study provides quantitative soil c inventory (table 14) and its changes as a result of land conversions from 2001 to 2016 (reported in section 3.4).
12,table 14 presents the potential total coi that can occur in the absence of any regulations and/or investments in emissions-risk management in vt.
12,the amount and social cost of co2 emissions from land disturbance in vt are sub- stantial with a total of $61.8 million from 2001 to 2016 (tables 12 and 13).
12,"moreover, the developed methodology can attribute the sources of these emissions at a level that is spe- cific: not only for vt as a whole, but also for specific developments, businesses, and even homes."
12,"developed methodology permits ready calculation of the coi both for vt as a whole, and for vermont’s failure to regulate land disturbance in specific counties and for specific projects."
12,"in vt, this new information could have an important legal impact."
12,it would permit vt to incorporate into its regulations control of ghg emissions from land disturbance.
12,"vermont’s gwsa imposes tight restrictions on ghg from fossil fuels, requiring a 40% reduction by 2030 and an 80% reduction by 2050 (gwsa 2020)."
12,"in addition, vermont’s law encourages sequestration, where additional tree coverage is encouraged that will absorb ghg emissions."
12,the absence of regulation of land disturbance is an important oversight.
12,vermont lawmakers could now revise the gwsa to regulate this important additional source of ghg emissions.
12,vermont might well do this because the coi is substantial and can now be readily calculated.
12,"additional regulation might take the form of limits on development, especially in areas with soils that release large amounts of ghg when disturbed (table 10) and in counties with much more development (table 13)."
12,"in addition, new regulation might be in the form of additional fees that would be imposed on developers that would reflect the full social costs of ghg emissions from land disturbance from their development projects."
12,the fees could be based on the type of soil in each county or municipality.
12,"currently, a developer pays none of the additional social cost of released ghg from a development’s land disturbance."
12,"basic economic principles demonstrate that when economic actors do not pay the full cost of their conduct, then they tend to do much of it."
12,"accordingly, one of the coi on charging development fees that reflect the full social cost of land disturbance is that there is an inefficiently large amount of development in vt, as developers proceed with some projects that have negative net social value."
12,"it may seem counterintuitive to argue that excessive development occurs in vt, a state with a population of low density."
12,"however, this study and simple economics show that this must be so, since developers are not bearing the full cost that their development imposes."
12,"significance of results in broader context not only in vt, but also in other states and countries outside the united states, conversions of land from low intensity (e.g., pasture, forests, etc.) to high-intensity covers (e.g., developments) can result in considerable soil-based emissions, particularly if the soil is rich in soil organic matter (e.g., soil order of histosols)."

13,figure 5 provides some examples of possible damages from soil emissions because of land conversions.
13,direct physical damages include carbon loss and increasing temperatures (figure 5).
13,"in addition, a state’s cost of borrowing can increase if a state suffers a climate crisis-related credit downgrade."
13,such a downgrade is an example of indirect tangible damage because of insufficient strategies to address climate change (figure 5)—which is a cost of inaction.

15,"laws 2022, 11, 48 15 of 18 defining these potential emissions by soil order allows for targeted action (e.g., pre- vention of land conversion) since these soils vary in soil carbon content and vulnerability to carbon loss."
15,the soil order of histosols is often a subject of state and federal protection because it is found in wetlands and has high soil organic carbon content.
15,this is an example where the “cost of action” is a regulatory action by the government to conserve wetlands which protects soil carbon from being lost into the atmosphere as a ghg.
15,"another coi will be that inaction will expose states, local governments, and private parties to environmental lawsuits."
15,"in recent years, there has been an explosion in such lawsuits."
15,these have been of two kinds.
15,"the first are lawsuits against public bodies, such as the environmental protection agency (epa) at the federal level, or environmental agencies at the state level."
15,such lawsuits have been filed in the u.s. and throughout the world (united nations environment programme 2017).
15,some have succeeded.
15,"for example, in urgenda foundation v."
15,"the state of the netherlands (2018), a dutch court ordered the government to seek a greater reduction in ghg, because a failure to do so would breach the government’s general duty to protect its people from the harms of climate change (upadhyay 2019)."
15,some of these suits have been based on general human rights laws or national or state constitutions.
15,"however, greater success has been enjoyed by lawsuits that invoke specific environ- mental laws (upadhyay 2019)."
15,"a lawsuit that asserts that a government’s environmental policies are violating specific provisions in a specific environmental statute is easier to win than a suit that asserts that ghg emissions are violating a constitution’s general requirements of “human rights,” “equality,” or a “right to life.”"
15,"all such suits face difficulty in the u.s. because of doctrines of governmental im- munity or “sovereign immunity,” through the 11th amendment for states, and through statutes and judge-made common law for counties and municipalities (klein 2015)."
15,"al- though a suit’s path to success is a difficult one, a suit can in certain circumstances, succeed despite the high hurdle of sovereign immunity."
15,"for example, in some states, sovereign immunity bars suits that seek money damages, but not suits that seek injunctive relief; injunctive relief is an order requiring the governmental entity not to pay money to the plaintiffs, but instead to do something, such as reducing ghg (klein 2015)."
15,"our research would make a state such as vt, with a strong environmental statute with specific goals for ghg reduction, a relatively easy target for lawsuits."
15,"although the vermont’s gwsa’s strict targets for 90% reduction by 2050 apply only to energy-related ghg emissions, the statute also includes very general language that speaks of the great harms of all ghg emissions (general assembly of the state of vermont 2020)."
15,"competent plaintiff’s attorneys could readily assert claims that, now that the extent of ghg emissions from land disturbance in vt is known, the gwsa explicitly or implicitly requires reduction in such emissions."
15,another coi would be exposure to a second class of lawsuits: suits filed not against the government but against private individuals and businesses.
15,"the developed methodology can estimate with precision not just ghg emissions from land disturbance for the state as a whole, but also for specific business locations and homes."
15,"armed with such data, plaintiffs could assert that a specific development—such as a housing subdivision—released ghg that harmed the plaintiffs."
15,"such lawsuits face hurdles of proving the elements of a negligence claim: duty, breach, causation, and injury (hunter and salzman 2007)."
15,"so far, despite occasional success in other countries, lawsuits against both governments and businesses for releasing ghg through burning fossil fuels have generally not succeeded in u.s. courts."
15,"for example, in juliana v."
15,"united states (2020), the plaintiffs sued the u.s. federal government to require it to impose a comprehensive plan to control ghs emissions."
15,"after winning in the trial court, the suit was dismissed on appeal, with the ninth circuit holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to seek such a comprehensive revision of national climate law."
15,"despite setbacks, plaintiffs continue to file additional suits, both against governments and against private entities."
15,"for example, in rhode island v."
15,chevron corp
16,"laws 2022, 11, 48 16 of 18 (2019), the state of rhode island is suing 21 oil companies, asserting that the companies have caused releases of ghg that have harmed the state."
16,"such suits may eventually succeed, as did suits against tobacco manufacturers after many years of failure."
16,or they may not.
16,"regardless of whether the lawsuits are successful, defending against the lawsuits will be expensive for both public and private defendants in terms of attorneys’ fees and disruption to normal activities."
16,"by acting quickly to regulate ghg gas emissions from land disturbance, both public and private defendants in vt could avoid the substantial coi of defending litigation."
16,"conclusions this study examined the potential of using the concept of coi in a narrower context by estimating partial coi from specific sources, such as land conversions, which can be used by the states to quantify and value ghg emissions using remote sensing tools and publicly available data."
16,this study used an analysis of soil and remote sensing-based land cover change to quantify the value and dynamics of soil c stocks at the state and county levels in vt.
16,this analysis can be used for the scenario-based comparison of the cost of action versus inaction with regard to soil-based emissions because of land conversions.
16,"the estimated total monetary mid-point value for tsc stocks in vt was $65.3b (i.e., 65.3 billion u.s. dollars (usd), where b = billion = 109 ), $55.0b for soc stocks, and $10.3b for sic stocks."
16,"soil orders with the highest midpoint value for soc were spodosols ($25.7b), histosols ($14.2b), and inceptisols ($12.0b)."
16,"soil orders with the highest midpoint value for sic were inceptisols ($6.9b), spodosols ($2.4b), and entisols ($757m) (where m = million = 106 )."
16,"soil orders with the highest midpoint value for tsc were spodosols ($27.0b), inceptisols ($19.0b), and histosols ($14.4b)."
16,"the counties with the highest midpoint soc values were orange ($7.2b), windham ($5.2b), and rutland ($5.0b)."
16,"the counties with the highest midpoint sic values were windsor ($1.4b), rutland ($1.3b), and caledonia ($1.1b)."
16,"the counties with the highest midpoint tsc values were orange ($7.8b), rutland ($6.3b), and windsor ($6.1b)."
16,land use/land cover (lulc) changes between 2001 and 2016 for vt had the maximum “realized” sc-co2 of $64.0m with soil orders of inceptisols ($27.0m) and spodosols ($16.0m) contributing the largest share to the total value.
16,"most “realized” sc-co2 were associated with so called “contagious” urban developments around already existing urbanized areas (e.g., burlington, south burlington, etc.)."
16,"the counties that have exhibited the most development were chittenden ($16.2m), bennington ($8.3m), and franklin ($7.6m)."
16,land cover change analysis integrated with soil cover can be a cost- effective method for the rapid assessment of the soil carbon inventory and soil-related ghg emissions on a regular basis to monitor the compliance with the greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions reduction targets set by the state of vt.
16,"while this study focused on identifying realized social costs of c from past land conversions, these techniques could be applied to identify the coi from these emissions to potentially assign legal and financial responsibility."
16,"the results provide a ready means and motive for vt to begin to regulate land disturbance more carefully, demonstrating that coi of continuing its present regulatory inaction may expose vt’s state and local governments, as well as private businesses, to an increased risk of becoming defendants in environmental lawsuits."
