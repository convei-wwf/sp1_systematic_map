2,"efforts to integrate scp with agricultural production prediction date back from 1990s (cane et al., 1994; hansen et al., 2006)."
2,"however, most previous studies focus on using historic weather classiﬁcation or analog methods that are based on the categorical el niño–southern oscillation or other empirical climate indices to prepare daily weather forcing and drive crop models to predict yield at a local scale (cane et al., 1994; hammer et al., 2001; hansen et al., 2006; hansen & indeje, 2004; nelson et al., 2002)."
2,"although the modeling system for scp has been continuously improved over the last two decades (doblas-reyes francisco et al., 2013; saha et al., 2006, 2014), the prediction skill always degrades beyond a short lead time (2 weeks to 1 month) and direct use of scp products in agricultural domain still gains less attention, especially in regional crop yield forecasting systems (cantelaube & terres, 2005; capa-morocho et al., 2016; challinor et al., 2005; iizumi et al., 2013; sivakumar et al., 2000)."
2,it is thus unknown to what extent scp can improve yield forecast at regional scales.
2,"intuitively, compared with crop yield forecasting models that only use climate variables, the inclusion of satel- lite observations should improve crop yield prediction, as such data provide real-time monitoring of crop growth status."
2,"though many studies have used remote sensing data for crop yield estimation (bolton & friedl, 2013; chaparro et al., 2018; guan et al., 2016, 2017; jin et al., 2017; johnson, 2014; lobell et al., 2015; lópez-lozano et al., 2015; sakamoto et al., 2013, 2014), the exact added value of satellite remote sensing for within-season forecasting of crop yield needs to be demonstrated and quantiﬁed."
2,"in this study, we built a seasonal forecasting system for u.s. maize yield by bridging the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep) coupled forecast system model version 2 (cfsv2) hindcast/forecast pro- ducts with a statistical crop modeling framework."
2,"speciﬁcally, we aimed to address the following research questions: (1) does cfsv2 provide useful information for the maize yield forecasting when benchmarked with historical climate ensembles?"
2,(2) will the maize yield forecasting performance be improved by adding remo- tely sensed variables as predictors in the model?
2,(3) how is the performance of the statistical maize yield sea- sonal forecasting system compared with yield forecast in the world agricultural supply and demand estimates (wasde) report of united states department of agriculture (usda)?
2,"it is worth noting that wasde forecast is primarily survey based (schnepf, 2017) and has been widely used for both policy-makers, industry, and ﬁnancial markets."
2,"we focused on u.s. maize yield forecasting, as the united states produces about 40% of the global maize production and is the world’s biggest maize exporter, and more than 80% of maize production in the united states are rainfed and thus is prone to climate variability (anderson et al., 2017; handler, 1984; iizumi et al., 2013; legler et al., 1999; lobell et al., 2014; phillips et al., 1999; schlenker & roberts, 2009)."

2,data set from usda we obtained the county-level harvested maize yield and area data during 1981 to 2016 from the usda national agricultural statistics service (nass) quick stats database.
2,"we selected all the “corn, grain” data items for all the states, including both irrigated and rainfed items."
2,the national maize yield forecast in the monthly usda wasde reports (see more details in text s1) was used as a benchmark for our yield hindcast.
2,the nass cropland data layer (cdl) was used to mask out the corn ﬁelds.
2,the cdl data have a 30-m spatial resolution during 2000 to 2016.
2,"however, we note that temporal coverage of cdl data differs for different states (table s2)."

3,"we assessed the performance of both cfsv2_raw and cfsv2_bc forecasts at monthly and county scales over the contiguous united states with a focus on the midwest, benchmarked with prism observations during 1982 to 2016."
3,"two deterministic metrics, that is, correlation coefﬁcient and root-mean-square error (rmse), were used to quantify the forecasting skill of cfsv2."
3,statistical yield prediction model we built a statistical modeling framework for u.s. maize yield prediction.
3,a global linear trend model was used to quantify the steady increase of yield from technology innovations.
3,two types of statistical models were used for yield anomaly prediction: the “climate-only” model and “climate + remote sensing” model.
3,"for “climate-only” model, we used the monthly mean temperature of june, july, and august, precipitation during june to september, and vpd from june up to the yield forecasting time as predictors."
3,"in the “climate + remote sensing” model, we included monthly evi data as an extra predictor besides those used in the “climate-only” model."
3,we updated the model monthly from june to september to include the latest available vpd/evi observations (table s4).
3,"a county-speciﬁc ﬁxed effect was included in all models to account for the local and time-invariant effects from different soils, management practices, seed varieties, etc."
3,"we used spline ﬁtting with speciﬁed knots for temperature, precipitation, and vpd, and second-order polynomial ﬁtting for evi."
3,more details about the yield prediction model can be found in text s3.
3,"model training and yield forecasting performance assessment we trained the models separately for rainfed and irrigated maize yield over the 12 midwest states, which account for 85% of total harvest corn area and 87% of total corn production in the united states during 1982 to 2016 (figure s1)."
3,"we used the forwarding out-of-sample method (i.e., using all the prior years data to train the model and then applying the model to predict yield of the next year), which is closer to opera- tional settings to assess the yield forecasting performance."
3,"as cdl data start to have full coverage of the midwest since 2007 (table s2), we showed the forwarding prediction results during 2010 to 2016 to ensure sufﬁcient training data."
3,"we also tested the leave-one-year-out method (i.e., using all years data during 1982 to 2016 except the target year to train the model and then make prediction for the target year) and found that the results were similar to the forwarding method."
3,"to demonstrate the added value of climate prediction from scp, we conducted forecasting experiments with the same model using the forecasted monthly mean temperature and precipitation from different scp data sets (cfsv2_raw and cfsv2_bc) and then compared the prediction results with that using monthly mean temperature and precipitation from the historical climate ensembles (hist_climate)."
3,the hist_climate ensem- bles were created by treating the observed climate in each year during 1981 to 2016 as an independent ensemble member.
3,"the same hist_climate ensembles were used for each year, assuming no prior knowledge about the climate pattern in the growing season."
3,"in this way, the hist_climate ensembles offered a benchmark for the scp-driven approach."
3,"to demonstrate the added value of remote sensing observations, we compared the yield forecasting performances of both “climate-only” and “climate + remote sensing” peng et al."

4,"in all the forecasting experiments, the observed monthly mean temperature and precipitation prior the yield forecasting month were combined with climate prediction from either cfsv2_raw, cfsv2_bc, or hist_climate till end of the growing season."
4,"the forecasted maize yield at county level was derived as the harvest-area-weighted average of the fore- casted rainfed and irrigated maize yield within a speciﬁc county, and the midwest yield was derived by aver- aging yield of each county within the midwest weighted by harvest area."
4,the midwest yield was then postcalibrated to national yield using a linear regression relationship between nass-reported historical midwestern and national yields.
4,the relationship was ﬁtted at one time using data from 1982 to 2016 and was ﬁxed as a constant for all the yield forecasting experiments (figure s2).
4,we then assessed the forecasting performance at both county and national levels.
4,all national yield forecasts were benchmarked with the wasde forecast.
4,"we used rmse to quantify the yield forecasting performance, and standard deviation of ensemble yield forecast or ensemble rmses to quantify the forecasting uncertainty."
4,"as the last ensemble in the monthly cfsv2 data is produced before eighth of each month (table s3), we set the yield forecasting time as eighth of each month."
4,results 4.1.
4,performance of cfsv2 over the contiguous united states and the midwest we evaluated the prediction performance of cfsv2 over the contiguous united states and compared the performances within and outside the 12 states of the midwest.
4,"generally, the prediction skill for temperature is better than that for precipitation."
4,"when the lead time is 0.5 month, cfsv2 shows better prediction perfor- mance with relatively higher correlation coefﬁcients (figure 1) and lower rmses (figure s3) for both tempera- ture and precipitation than other longer lead time."
4,"after bias correction, the correlation coefﬁcient does not change (figure 1 and figure s4), while rmse does signiﬁcantly decrease for both temperature and precipita- tion (figures s3 and s5)."
4,the performance of cfsv2 also varies spatially.
4,"speciﬁcally, the performance within the midwest shows signiﬁcant difference with that outside the midwest."
4,"the cfsv2_raw temperature shows lower averaged correlation coefﬁcients within the midwest than that outside the midwest, except for the 0.5-month lead time forecast made in may, july, and september (figure 1a), and consistently higher rmses within the midwest than those outside the midwest (figure s3a)."
4,"for cfsv2_raw precipitation forecast, the 0.5-month lead time forecast made in may and june shows lower correlation coefﬁcients within the midwest than the outside (figure 1b), and the rmses of all forecasts made for may to july within the midwest are consistently higher than those outside the midwest (figure s3b)."
4,"additionally, the rmse for precipitation is lower for the western united states where the climate is drier than for the eastern united states (figure s3b)."
4,the performance is also spatially heterogeneous within the midwest.
4,the southern part shows relatively lower correlation coefﬁ- cients than other places of the midwest for temperature forecast in june and july (figure 1a) and is a hotspot with higher rmse value for precipitation forecast across the whole growing season (figure s3b).
4,similar dif- ferences in the spatial pattern of performance were found for cfsv2_bc (figures s4 and s5).
4,"therefore, the prediction performance of cfsv2 for both temperature and precipitation over the midwest has the space for improvement."
4,performance of maize yield forecast at the national level we compared the national yield forecasting performances of different models with cfsv2_bc as climate forcing in figure 2.
4,"compared with the “t + p” model, adding vpd as predictor (“t + p + vpd” model) after june improves the national yield forecasting performance, and adding evi upon the “t + p + vpd” model (“t + p + vpd + evi” model) further improves the forecasting performance during july to september."
4,the performance improvement through adding vpd or evi is much more signiﬁcant in august and september when the observed vpd or evi before end of july or august is available.
4,"the improvement is expected as two most important phenological stages, ﬂowering and grain ﬁlling, happen in july and august, respectively."
4,"when compared with the wasde forecast, the “t + p” model with cfsv2_bc forcing in june outperforms the wasde forecast with 28% lower rmse (17.66 bushels per acre for wasde versus 12.75 bushels per acre for t + p model)."
4,the better performance is not surprising as the june forecast in wasde report is produced peng et al.

6,"the “t + p” and “t + p + vpd” models do not outperform the wasde forecast from july to september, but the “t + p + vpd + evi” model does."

6,"in the following analysis, we will use the “t + p + vpd + evi” model for its high performance on national yield forecasting."
6,we further compared the national yield forecasting performances of the “t + p + vpd + evi” model with different climate forcing data sets (figure 3a).
6,"generally, we ﬁnd that the performance of using cfsv2_raw is worse than those of using hist_climate for maize yield forecasting at national scale."

6,"the yield anomalies can be largely captured as early as august 8th with rmses of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79% of multiyear averaged yield) and 5.63 bushels per acre (3.60% of multiyear averaged yield) for cfsv2_bc and wasde, respectively (figure 3d)."
6,"both cfsv2_raw and cfsv2_bc can capture the yield decrease in 2012, which is an extreme drought year, as early as in june, while wasde forecasted a yield increase in june of 2012 (figure 3b)."
6,using the cfsv2_bc leads to a better forecast that is closer to the nass-reported ﬁnal yield in both june and july (figures 3b and 3c).
6,"moreover, the cfsv2_raw and cfsv2_bc-based yield forecasts have much smaller uncertainties (quantiﬁed as ensemble yield standard deviation in figure s6) than the forecast made using hist_climate before september."
6,"these ﬁndings demonstrate that scp has added value for yield forecast, which improves yield prediction in early months and in extreme years."
6,performance of maize yield forecast at the county level the county-level yield forecasting performance of the “t + p + vpd + evi” model with different climate for- cing data sets were intercompared in figures 4a and 4b.
6,"when using the hist_climate, the yield forecasting performance does not change before june, as the climate prediction performance of hist_climate does not evolve with decreasing lead time."
6,"cfsv2_raw- and cfsv2_bc-based forecasts start to improve as early as in april, which demonstrates that for lead month shorter than 3 months, the climate forecast from the scp adds value to u.s. county-level maize yield forecasting."
6,"after june when prior climate and remote sensing obser- vations are ingested into the forecasting system, the performances of forecasts using all climate forcing data sets (cfsv2_raw, cfsv2_bc, and hist_climate) are signiﬁcantly improved."
6,"especially, there is a signiﬁcant per- formance improvement in august when prior observations in july become available (figure 4a)."
6,"again, these ﬁndings highlight that july is a critical month for u.s. maize yield forecasting."
6,"without bias correction, using the cfsv2_raw in the yield forecasting system cannot achieve the same performance as using the hist_climate, especially in earlier months."
6,the cfsv2_bc shows a better yield forecasting performance than the cfsv2_raw and hist_climate starting from may.
6,another advantage of using climate forecast from the scp is that it can reduce the yield forecasting uncertainty when benchmarked with using the hist_climate from may to july (figure 4b).

8,"discussion this study provided a systematic assessment of incorporating scp into u.s. maize yield forecasting, with explicit comparison with the wasde forecast, benchmarked with the nass yield observation data."
8,we found that monthly cfsv2 product can help improve yield forecast (lower rmse and uncertainties) compared with peng et al.

9,these ﬁndings highlighted that seasonal agricultural production forecasting could directly beneﬁt from the continuously evolving scp.
9,"our study also indicated that the maize yield forecasting performance may be further improved when the prediction skill of cfsv2 is improved in the early growing season over the midwest, especially over its southern part."
9,"we also showed that adding remote sensing observation of crop growth condition (i.e., evi) achieved superior yield forecast when benchmarked with the survey-based wasde forecast, while the “climate-only” model could not match the wasde forecast."
9,the yield forecasting performance improvement from the inclusion of satel- lite remote sensing was most noticeable for forecast made in early august and september.
9,"here we only included evi, which is an indicator for canopy greenness."
9,"as different satellite sensors can provide both shared and unique information that is useful for crop monitoring and yield prediction (guan et al., 2017), an immediate step forward is to add more remote sensing observations, such as ﬂuorescence, thermal, and microwave observations."
9,"therefore, more extensive incorporation of satellite remote sensing data has great potential to improve forecasting food production."
9,we used a multivariate nonlinear regression model here to demonstrate the added value of scp and remote sensing observations.
9,"although decent forecasting performance has been achieved using this simple statistical framework when benchmarked with nass- reported yield, more advanced algorithms, such as machine learning algorithms (cai et al., 2017; you et al., 2017), have the potential for further improvements."
