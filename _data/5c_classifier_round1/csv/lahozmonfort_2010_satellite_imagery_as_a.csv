2,"statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation inter- ventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect."
2,"sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are them- selves diﬃcult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the alaotran gentle lemur hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur conﬁned to the marshes of lake alaotra in madagascar."
2,"we developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indi- ces and image texture measures at diﬀerent scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from landsat7 satellite imagery."
2,"using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (maxent) approach and auc were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the eﬀect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat."
2,"this study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a ﬁne grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable."
2,"in the case of h. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform con- servation management in lake alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future."

2,"this study presents a cost-eﬀective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from landsat7 images."
2,"with a habitat modelling method like maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or diﬃcult to obtain."
