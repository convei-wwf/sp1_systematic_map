2,"if a habitat of interest corresponds to spectrally separable land cover class(es), then this activity can benefit from the production of accurate land cover maps from remotely sensed imagery."
2,"traditionally, the image classification techniques used assume that the set of classes has been defined exhaustively, which requires all of the classes in the region to be included explicitly in the analysis."
2,"often, however, interest focuses on just one or a small sub-set of the classes occurring in the region that represent the habitat(s) of particular interest."
2,"moreover, given that the size of a training set required for an image classification is typically taken to be a function of the number of classes and discriminating variables (e.g. wavebands) used in the classification, the satisfaction of the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes requires that much effort is directed wastefully on classes of little, if any, direct interest."
2,savings in training could be achieved by focusing on the class(es) of specific interest.
2,a more appropriate approach for mapping a specific class may be to adopt a binary classification analysis that simply seeks to separate the class of interest from all others.
2,in this way the analysis focuses on the class(es) of interest and a small training set may be used.
2,an attractive means to achieve this is through the adoption of decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches to classification.
2,"this paper evaluates the accuracy with which a habitat of interest to the eu habitats directive, fen, can be mapped from landsat etm + imagery of the norfolk broads using such classifiers as well as, for comparative purposes, a standard maximum likelihood decision rule implemented by a discriminant analysis."
2,"all analyses yielded accurate classifica- tions, with a conventional approach based on a maximum likelihood allocation providing an overall classification accuracy of 88.4%."
2,"however, both the decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches provided classifications that were significantly more accurate than conventional maximum likelihood classification (p,0.05), with overall accuracies of 91.6 and 93.6%, respectively (table 3)."

3,boyd et al. interest in a manner that is less wasteful of resources and effort and that yields a more accurate classification than the standard approach.
3,introduction habitat fragmentation and destruction have major negative impacts on biodiversity.
3,"the loss of biodiversity is a global problem with economic, biological, societal and ethical consequences; ranking as one of the greatest problems currently facing society (van kooten et al."
3,"2000, harris 2004)."
3,"increasing human activity across the globe has rapidly accelerated the pace of land cover and land use change, resulting in widespread changes in the spatial structure of native habitats and biodiversity loss (collinge 1996)."
3,"as a result, much debate has ensued over ways of retaining biodiversity, with habitat protection being one of many steps (mcneely et al."
3,1990).
3,"the signing of the biodiversity convention at the rio ‘earth summit’ conference in 1992, by a number of countries, demonstrates the political commitment to retaining biodiversity (ledoux et al."
3,2000).
3,"however, there are still decisions to be taken on which habitats to conserve and how much land is required for their conservation."
3,"given that these decisions are subject to ever-changing external forces, there is a need for habitat protection to be approached in a competitive and efficient manner (jones 2004)."
3,"as a signatory of the biodiversity convention, part of the european union’s (eu) response to the problem of biodiversity loss has been to draft its habitats directive, which aims to protect biodiversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (directive 92/43/eec)."
3,"the implementation of the directive establishes the designation of special areas of conservation (sacs) and special protection areas (spas), which form the natura 2000 network of protected areas."
3,"once designated, natura 2000 sites are to be protected from deterioration and damage and so in effect the directive is underpinned by a no-net- loss policy."
3,"consequently, any loss of protected habitats must be compensated for by restoration or creation of new ones of at least the same surface area and providing the same ecological value."
3,"continued monitoring of habitats is also required, not least to keep track of ecosystem changes (including those linked to climate change), natural change and co-evolutionary feedback effects (turner et al."
3,1998).
3,"monitoring the quantitative and qualitative changes of protected habitats has, therefore, become a priority issue and one that may benefit from remote sensing."
3,remote sensing has enormous potential as a source of land cover information (boyd and foody 2004).
3,"in particular, remote sensing is well suited to the task of monitoring land cover and its dynamics for conservation activities at a range of scales (e.g."
3,"roy and tomar 2000, amarnath et al."
3,"2003, kerr and ostrovsky 2003, rouget 2003), including those associated with the demands of the eu habitats directive."
3,"commonly, supervised image classification is the basis of land cover and land cover change assessments."
3,the use of supervised image classification in this instance requires the accurate mapping of the habitat(s) of interest in order to allow the effective management of that habitat and compliance with regulations.
3,this may be achieved if each habitat of interest relates to spectrally separable land cover classes.
3,"for simplicity of discussion, it will be assumed throughout the rest of this article that a single habitat of interest corresponds to a single land cover class (as it does in the example below) and that the terms habitat and class may, therefore, at times be used synonymously."
4,"mapping a specific thematic class 2633 in the context of meeting the eu habitats directive, the accuracy with which the class (habitat) of interest is classified is critical."
4,"although there are many examples of the use of supervised image classifiers to accurately map land cover from remotely sensed imagery, there are many problems that occur to limit accuracy (foody 2002)."
4,a vast array of reasons may be offered to explain the failure to accurately classify land cover ranging from problems with the imagery (e.g. its spectral and spatial resolution) through to the nature of the classes on the ground (e.g. continuous intergradation of some semi-natural classes).
4,"as a result of this situation, considerable research has been directed to solving the problems in order to raise the accuracy with which land cover may be mapped."
4,"much effort has, for example, been directed to the classification techniques used to derive land cover maps from remotely sensed imagery."
4,"recently, for example, the limitations of conventional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classification (mlc) have been recognized and alternatives such as artificial neural networks promoted (liu et al."
4,2003).
4,"although considerable progress has been made, the accuracy with which land cover may be mapped is still a cause for concern."
4,one reason for this is that the fundamental nature of standard image classification approaches is sometimes inappropriate for the application.
4,"in general, standard classification analyses assume that the classes are discrete, mutually exclusive and have been exhaustively defined."
4,in some instances it could be possible to build a classifier that leaves sampling units (e.g. pixels) unclassified if some criterion (e.g. probability threshold) is not met.
4,"however, the problem remains on how to set the criterion."
4,soft or fuzzy classifications have also been promoted as a means of accommodating problems arising from the presence of continuous classes that result in the failure to satisfy the assumptions of discrete and mutually exclusive classes.
4,"however, relatively little work has addressed the issue of an exhaustively defined set of classes."
4,"if a class is present in the region to be mapped but absent from the training stage of the classification (i.e. the failure to exhaustively define the set of classes has resulted in the presence of an untrained class), cases of that class will be commissioned by the set of trained classes in the analysis, leading to error."
4,"furthermore, this may not actually be measured and reflected in the accuracy statement that should accompany the classification (foody 2004a)."
4,"it is, therefore important that all classes be included in an image classification to ensure the assumption of an exhaustively defined set is satisfied."
4,"given that the satisfaction of this assumption has implications for training the classifier, with the size of the training set required for a classification commonly linked to the number of classes as well as the properties of the data used (e.g. number of wavebands), this places substantial demands on the analyst producing a land cover map."
4,"for example, the number of training samples required for a classification is often regarded to be in the order of at least 10–30 samples per class per waveband used in the analysis (mather 2004)."
4,"furthermore, some of the classes may be of little or no interest to the study."
4,"commonly, and as with the demands of the eu habitats directive, interest is focused on just a sub-set of the classes found at the test site."
4,"moreover, the requirement to direct substantial resources and effort to ensure that adequate training data are acquired for all classes, including those for which there is no interest, is wasteful."
4,"another important issue is that standard probabilistic approaches, such as mlc, aim to maximize the overall probability that a pixel is allocated to a class correctly,"
5,2634 d.
5,boyd et al. rather than focus on the accuracy with which the specific class of actual interest is classified.
5,"although this is often an entirely logical basis for some analysis, it may be not appropriate for priority mapping applications."
5,"overall accuracy is just one component of classification accuracy and, as here, need not be suited to the needs of a particular study."
5,"thus, for example, to map the fen class with a conventional classifier, the analyst would have to train not only on this class but also every other class that occurred within the region to be mapped (e.g. forest, water, urban, cereal crops, grass, etc.) and the conventional classifier will seek to optimize overall accuracy, to which the fenland class is only one contributor."
5,"it may be more appropriate and efficient instead to focus on the single class of interest, producing a competitive and efficient approach required by the stakeholders in habitat management."
5,such an approach provides the targeted information required for conservation actions which fits with the evidence-based approach promoted for nature conservation (pullin et al.
5,2004).
5,a variety of methods could be used to accurately map a single class such as fenland from remotely sensed imagery.
5,"for example, a standard probabilistic classifier could be optimized to minimize error associated with that class (lark 1995)."
5,"this approach, however, typically trades one type of error with another and may require further analyses to produce a final map of the class of interest (foody et al."
5,2005).
5,"alternatively, a soft classification using an absolute measure of class membership may be used to indicate the spatial distribution of the class."
5,"this approach is also not without problems, not least the determination of a threshold membership value to apply in separating members of the class from non-members."
5,"moreover, with both approaches, assumptions of the data are also commonly made with the classifiers used."
5,a more appropriate approach may be to adopt a non- parametric binary classification analysis that simply seeks to separate the class of interest from all others.
5,attractive means to achieve this are through the adoption of techniques such as a support vector machine (svm) or a decision tree (dt) classifier.
5,a dt learns from a data set and is able to classify previously unseen cases through the formulation of explicit rules (goel et al.
5,2003).
5,"dt induction algorithms have long been popular in machine learning, statistics and other disciplines for solving classification and related tasks."
5,"recently, dts have become popular for the classification of remotely sensed data for the production of land cover maps (pal and mather 2003, brown de colstoun et al."
5,"2003, joy et al."
5,2003).
5,"dt algorithms are less demanding than the conventional mlc due to their non-parametric nature, conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency (friedl and brodley 1997, pal and mather 2003)."
5,"they can also allow for missing values and are capable of handling both numeric and categorical inputs (fayyad and irani 1992, hampson and volper 1986)."
5,"here, the key feature of the dt is that it may be used to simply discriminate the single class of interest from all others."
5,"as with the dt approach, the potential of svm for the classification of remotely sensed data has been recognized recently."
5,"comparative studies have also demonstrated that an svm may be used to classify land cover more accurately than conventional approaches, such as the mlc as well as popular alternatives like neural networks (huang et al."
5,"2002, foody and mathur 2004a)."
5,an svm is a binary classifier that seeks to fit an optimal separating decision boundary between the classes.
5,"it is, therefore, well suited to the mapping of a single class of interest, by separating it from all others."
5,"the classification process is based on support vectors,"
6,mapping a specific thematic class 2635 essentially training samples that lie near in the border region between the classes on the very edge of the class distributions in feature space.
6,these training samples of the habitat class can be acquired along with a sample of cases from the other classes.
6,"if the classes are spectrally separable, the detailed nature of the cases drawn from the non-habitat class (e.g. if a pure pixel, its exact location and if forest, grass, water, etc.) is of little concern and a small number of cases of this class simply needs to be acquired to indicate its presence to aid the fitting of a separating hyperplane."
6,this would only require a knowledge of the spectral response of the classes (including those that are bound together within the non-fen class) to take advantage of this property.
6,"it was not an advantage explored fully in this study, however others demonstrate this well (e.g."
6,foody and mathur 2004b).
6,"although some effort is required in training the non-habitat class, the degree of rigour and precision required is less than in training a conventional classifier and so the process can be considerably less demanding than with standard classifications (foody and mathur 2004b)."
6,"this paper aims to evaluate the potential of svm and dt classification for the mapping of a specific habitat of interest, fen."
6,fenlands are dynamic semi-natural systems.
6,fen habitats support a large diversity of plant and animal communities.
6,"some of these fens contain up to 550 species of higher plants, a third of the uk’s native plant species; up to and occasionally more than half the uk’s species of dragonflies and several thousand other insect species."
6,this makes fen a particularly important habitat to be considered for protection under the uk’s conservation regulations (cooper et al.
6,2003).
6,"consequently, a number of uk fens have been proposed as sacs under the eu habitats directive."
6,within the uk the management of this habitat falls under the responsibility of several agencies and departments.
6,"one in particular is the broads authority, which manages 5000 ha of undrained fens across east anglia, the largest expanse in lowland britain (figure 1)."
6,"if mapping of fenlands using svm and dt results in higher accuracies than standard probabilistic approaches, then these methods can be used as the basis for informed management to monitor open-fen communities 2."
6,data and methods a landsat 7 etm + image of east anglia acquired on 19 june 2000 was provided by the nerc earth observation centre.
6,the six non-thermal spectral bands (bands 1–5 and 7) with a spatial resolution of 30 m were selected for use in the analyses.
6,these data were geometrically corrected to the uk national grid with an estimated rms error of 0.12 pixels.
6,aerial photography acquired in june 1999 was also geocorrected to the data.
6,these photographs were used to select eight broadly defined land cover classes that dominated the land cover of the norfolk region.
6,"fen was considered the habitat class of interest in this study as opposed to the other seven (salt marsh, grazing marsh, agriculture, forest, urban, sand and water), which together constituted the ‘other class’."
6,"training and testing data sets, comprising pure pixels (100% cover of a single class) drawn from regions of the eight land cover classes were extracted from the landsat etm + image."
6,"the acquisition of these data sets was guided by the aerial photography and focused mainly on the class of interest, fen (table 1)."
6,both the training and testing data were selected randomly for each of the eight land cover classes.
6,"these data were used in classifications by three different methods: a dt, an svm and a mlc by a discriminant analysis, with the classification methods"

8,mapping a specific thematic class 2637 determining how the training and testing data were used.
8,the discriminant analysis was used to generate a standard multi-class classification and as such provided a conventional benchmark against which to evaluate the dt and svm classifications.
8,the discriminant analysis implemented was based on a linear approach which assumes an equal covariance of the classes.
8,"when this covariance is not equal, a quadratic approach is normally adopted."
8,"to assess whether the covariance between all the classes is equal or not, a good definition of each is needed and consequently a big sample is necessary."
8,"this, however, was not of interest in this study."
8,"as well as the conventional classification, the discriminant analysis was also used in a binary fashion where the training set comprised the class of interest (fen) and ‘other’ (all the seven classes amalgamated into one, non-fen, class)."
8,a series of binary classifications (to classify fen and ‘other’) were undertaken using dt and svm classifiers.
8,a dt classifier breaks a classification problem down into multiple stages and at each stage a relatively simple decision is made.
8,"the tree comprises a root node that contains all of the data, a set of internal nodes or splits and a set of terminal nodes or leaves."
8,each internal node has only one parent and two or more descendant nodes.
8,"a remotely sensed data set is classified by sub- dividing it according to the decision framework defined by the tree with each pixel allocated on the basis of the leaf node it is associated with (safavian and landgrebe 1991, friedl and brodley 1997)."
8,"the dt classifier adopted was cart (classification and regression trees), developed by salford systems, which is based upon the original theory developed by breiman et al."
8,(1984).
8,it used a multivariate algorithm and the splitting rule used at the internal nodes of the tree was the gini index (breiman et al.
8,1984).
8,"defined briefly, the gini index is an impurity function approach where impurity is a measure of the class mix of a subset and splits are chosen so that the decrease in impurity is maximized."
8,svm are binary classifiers that may also be used to derive a multi-class classification if desired (huang et al.
8,"2002, foody and mathur 2004a)."
8,"here, attention was focused on basic binary svm."
8,an svm aims to fit an optimal separating hyperplane between the classes.
8,in some instances the classes might not be linearly separable.
8,kernel representations offer a solution to this as boser et al. (1992) showed based upon the work of aizerman et al. (1964) by projecting the data into a high-dimensional space.
8,details on mathematic basis of svm are provided extensively in the literature (e.g.
8,"gunn 1998, huang et al."
8,"2002, foody and mathur 2004a) and so not included here."
8,"the binary svm used for this analysis was developed by image, speech and intelligent systems research group, school of electronics and computer science, university of southampton."
8,the most important factors that affect the classification accuracy of svm classifiers are: (i) the choice of kernel used for data mapping; (ii) the choice of the parameters related to a particular kernel; and (iii) the choice of parameter c (which controls the penalty associated with misclassifications).
8,"there is little guidance in the literature on the criteria to be used to choose a kernel, its specific parameters and value of c (pal and mather 2005)."
8,"however, it is very important that these parameters are specified (vapnik 1995, gunn 1998, brown et al."
8,"1999, foody and mathur 2004a)."
8,according to cherkassky and ma (2004) there are quite a few methods for selecting kernel and kernel parameters for svm classification and regression.
8,"of all of them, the most straightforward option is using a v-fold cross-validation (cherkassky and mulier 1998, schölkopf et al."
8,"1999, hsu et al."
8,2004).
8,"accordingly, the kernel, kernel parameters and value of c were selected from a series of analyses using a range of"
9,2638 d.
9,"boyd et al. kernel types (exponential, polynomial, gaussian and spline) and a variety of settings for c (varying from 1 to 1000) with a focus on accuracy assessed through a 5-fold cross-validation approach."
9,"on the basis of these analyses, the gaussian radial basis function kernel of free parameter value 1 was selected and c5100 for all svm classifications undertaken."
9,the accuracy of every classification was evaluated with the same testing set and expressed in terms of the percentage of correctly allocated cases.
9,the statistical significance of differences in classification accuracy was assessed using a mcnemar test with the assessment based on the evaluation of the derived z statistic (foody 2004b).
9,"throughout the evaluation, particular attention was focused on the accuracy with which the fen class was classified."
9,"since a major concern was to ensure that all areas of fen were identified, omission error (labelling a case ‘other’ when it is actually a member of the fen class) was considered more important than commission error (labelling a case fen when it is actually a member of the ‘other’ class) and so attention focused on producer’s accuracy (story and congalton 1986) of fenland classification."
9,"the derived land cover map could, however, be used to direct field work to reduce commission errors if required."
9,"since it is possible to produce a map with a very high producer’s but also low user’s accuracy for a class, which may be of limited value, the producer’s accuracy was not viewed in isolation of overall and user’s accuracy."
9,"in this way, the assessment of the classifications placed most emphasis on the correct labelling of the fen class within the context of a fenland habitat monitoring application in which it was important to limit omission."
9,"results and discussion as a benchmark, a discriminant analysis was undertaken using all six spectral discriminating variables to classify the eight land cover classes defined."
9,this analysis represented what may be considered to be a standard approach to thematic mapping from remotely sensed imagery.
9,"the overall accuracy with which the test set was classified by the discriminant analysis was 88.4% (table 2), and the producer’s accuracy of fenland classification 92.8% (116 out of 125 cases, table 2)."
9,"as mentioned in the previous section, a concern with this analysis was that the training set size was relatively small for some classes, substantially below the size that would be recommended on the basis of the number of discriminating variables used."
9,"therefore, if a larger number of training samples had been available this might have improved the classifier accuracy and even surpassed that obtained by other non- parametric classifiers, and its use could be more appropriate in some cases."
9,each classifier partitions feature space in its own way; knowledge of this leads to a selection of one that is appropriate for the dataset and the challenge in question.
9,"therefore, although the standard multi-class approach yielded an accurate classification (table 2), particularly so with the producer’s accuracy of fenland classification, all further analysis was focused on the potential of binary classifiers, using the same set of training and testing sites; use of the binary classification approach addresses the resource constraints commonly associated with conservation activities."
9,"for comparative purposes, a binary discriminant analysis was under- taken."
9,"as might be expected from the parametric nature of this approach to classification, the amalgamation of the non-fen classes reduced separability and classification accuracy to an overall accuracy of 81.2% (table 3a)."
9,this emphasizes the advantages of dt and svm over parametric methods when: (1) the aim of the research is to focus on a class(es) of interest; and/or (2) it is not very well known how

11,"both the dt and svm were used to derive accurate classifications, with overall (binary) accuracies of 91.6 and 93.6% respectively (table 3); each significantly higher than the corresponding binary discriminant analysis (z5,3.0, significant at 95% level)."
11,in the case of the dt this was achieved by a simple tree of two splits and three terminal nodes.
11,"moreover, the producer’s accuracy with which the fen class was classified was also very high at 99.2 and 92.8% from the dt and svm classifications, respectively."

11,"the research presented in this paper provides the context of a problem associated with efficiency savings and directed mapping, using the fens class as an example."
11,"further research would be required to fully examine the potential of using binary classifiers and could examine issues such as training data size, spectral separability of the classes of interest."
11,the widespread use of the binary classification approach is highly dependent on the problem to be addressed.
11,"if full thematic detail is required, the use of binary classifiers would not be appropriate."
11,"in some applications it may be useful to have information on the other classes, especially which specific classes are associated with any spectral confusion and mis-classification."
11,"if, however, only figure 2."
11,example of output from the support vector machine binary classification.
11,the white pixels are areas of fenland.
11,commission errors evident in the output are to be addressed with post-classification expert knowledge (e.g. directed fieldwork).
12,"mapping a specific thematic class 2641 information on the specific class of interest is required, the binary classifiers offer a means of deriving more accurate classifications."
12,"monitoring a specific class may, therefore, benefit from the adoption of binary classifiers."
12,"this activity will, however, be sensitive to non-thematic errors, such as those due to spatial mis- registration, which are often a major limitation to monitoring activities by remote sensing."
12,"given that the binary classifiers can be used to separate a single class of interest from all others, their use may also enable a reduction in activities associated with training the classifier without loss of accuracy."
12,"in particular, the use of these classifiers could reduce problems associated with having to exhaustively define and rigorously train all classes."
12,"while the correct use of a conventional statistical classifier such as a discriminant analysis requires a relatively large training sample for each class, and this size increases multiplicatively with an increase in the dimensionality of the data set used, classification with a svm, for example, can be focused mainly on the class of interest."
12,"training data for the ‘other’ class are still required, but if the classes are spectrally separable from the class of interest, large training sets are not necessary."
12,"since resources to support conservation activities are often scarce, the ability to focus on the class of specific interest and to reduce the amount of effort wastefully directed on other classes simply to satisfy the assumptions of some classification techniques may help to realize the potential of remote sensing as a source of targetted information."
12,the potential to classify a specific class with the aid of a small training sample should be evaluated in future work.
12,"similarly, the potential of one-class classifiers should be assessed as these also could greatly reduce the training data requirements."
12,"summary and conclusions remote sensing has enormous potential as a source of land cover information and in particular, for monitoring land cover and its dynamics at the scales associated with the demands of the eu habitats directive."
12,"commonly, supervised image classification is the basis of land cover and land cover change assessments."
12,this type of analysis aims to convert the remotely sensed image into a thematic map that depicts the spatial distribution of the various land cover classes found within the region.
12,"in standard statistical supervised image classifications, the aim is often to maximize the overall probability that a pixel is allocated to a class correctly."
12,this requires that each class within the area to be mapped is included in the analysis to satisfy the implicit assumption made in standard classifications analyses of an exhaustively defined set of classes.
12,"although this is a logical basis for some classifications, it is not always appropriate, especially as it treats all classes, including those of no interest, equally rather than focus on the sub-set of classes that is of actual interest."
12,"while the results show that this conventional approach can yield an accurate classification, statistically significantly increases in accuracy were achieved through the use of simple binary classifications by dt and svm that aimed to separate the class of interest from all others."
12,"moreover, there are potential savings, especially in relation to training the analysis, that may be achieved with the binary approach to classification."
12,"given the resource constraints commonly associated with conservation activities, the ability to usefully target the analysis on the class of interest and use small training sets is an advantageous feature of the binary approaches to classification for the acquisition of information on a specific habitat from remotely sensed imagery."
