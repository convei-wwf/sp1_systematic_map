TI  - Acceleration Of Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope Signal Processing To Real-Time Speed With The Auto-Pipe Design System
JO  - Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment
PY  - 2008
AB  - The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique for high-energy gamma-ray astronomy is emerging as an important new technique for studying the high energy universe. Current experiments have data rates of ≈ 20 TB / year and duty cycles of about 10%. In the future, more sensitive experiments may produce up to 1000 TB/year. The data analysis task for these experiments requires keeping up with this data rate in close to real-time. Such data analysis is a classic example of a streaming application with very high performance requirements. This class of application often benefits greatly from the use of non-traditional approaches for computation including using special purpose hardware (FPGAs and ASICs), or sophisticated parallel processing techniques. However, designing, debugging, and deploying to these architectures is difficult and thus they are not widely used by the astrophysics community. This paper presents the Auto-Pipe design toolset that has been developed to address many of the difficulties in taking advantage of complex streaming computer architectures for such applications. Auto-Pipe incorporates a high-level coordination language, functional and performance simulation tools, and the ability to deploy applications to sophisticated architectures. Using the Auto-Pipe toolset, we have implemented the front-end portion of an imaging Cherenkov data analysis application, suitable for real-time or offline analysis. The application operates on data from the VERITAS experiment, and shows how Auto-Pipe can greatly ease performance optimization and application deployment of a wide variety of platforms. We demonstrate a performance improvement over a traditional software approach of 32 x using an FPGA solution and 3.6 x using a multiprocessor based solution. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Classification Of Coastal Salt Marsh Based On Sentinel-1 Time Series Backscattering Characteristics: The Case Of The Yangtze River Delta
JO  - National Remote Sensing Bulletin
PY  - 2022
AB  - Salt marshes are highly productive ecosystems in the mid-high latitude coastal zone, and the ecological service functions provided by different types of salt marsh vegetation are significantly different. The combination of human activities and natural factors such as reclamation, invasion of Spartina alterniflora, and sea level rise has led to rapid changes in the structure and spatial distribution of salt marshes in China's coastal zone. Existing optical methods are subject to tidal and cloud interference in the coastal zone. Obtaining large-scale and high-efficiency salt marsh vegetation information using hyperspectral or LiDAR data is difficult.This study took the Yangtze River estuary as the research area and proposed a coastal salt marsh vegetation classification method based on vegetation phenology and multi-temporal radar backscatter feature. Sentinel-1 radar data were used to analyze the annual time-series characteristics of radar backscattering in salt marshes, intertidal forest swamps, mudflats, and water bodies. Based on the phenological characteristics of salt marsh vegetation, the separability between the monthly backscattering characteristics of a typical salt marsh was calculated based on the separation threshold method. According to the optimal time-series radar classification characteristics, the random forest method was used to obtain the species, structure, and spatial distribution of salt marsh vegetation.Results showed the following. (1) The average value of VH polarization backscattering can distinguish water bodies, light beaches, intertidal forest swamps, and salt marshes well. (2) The mean backscattering values of VV polarization in April, VH polarization in November, and VV polarization in March were the optimal characteristics of Scirpus × mariqueter, Spartina alterniflora, and Phragmites australis. (3) Obtained by the optimal characteristics and random forest classification algorithm, the general classification accuracy of salt marsh vegetation was 85% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.80.Compared with optical remote sensing, radar images can effectively obtain the inter-annual and inter-monthly time series backscattering characteristics of salt marsh vegetation, and accurately obtain the spatial dynamics of coastal salt marsh vegetation. This study has shown the application potential of radar images in coastal zone research and provides important technical means and data support for coastal biodiversity conservation, wetland ecosystem function enhancement, and ecological environment management. © 2022, Science Press.

TI  - Changes Of Ecosystem Service Values In Response To Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics In Munessa-Shashemene Landscape Of The Ethiopian Highlands
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2016
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics alter ecosystem services values (ESVs), yet quantitative evaluations of changes in ESVs are seldom attempted. Using Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the Ethiopian highlands as an example, we showed estimate of changes in ESVs in response to LULC dynamics over the past four decades (1973-2012). Estimation and change analyses of ESVs were conducted, mainly, by employing GIS using LULC datasets of the year 1973, 1986, 2000 and 2012 with their corresponding global value coefficients developed earlier and our own modified conservative value coefficients for the studied landscape. The results between periods revealed a decrease of total ESVs from US\$ 130.5 million in 1973, to US\$ 118.5, 114.8 and 111.1 million in 1986, 2000 and 2012, respectively. While using global value coefficients, the total ESVs declined from US\$ 164.6 million in 1973, to US\$ 135.8, 127.2 and 118.7 million in 1986, 2000 and 2012, respectively. The results from the analyses of changes in the four decades revealed a total loss of ESVs ranging from US\$ 19.3 million when using our own modified value coefficients to US\$ 45.9 million when employing global value coefficients. Changes have also occurred in values of individual ecosystem service functions, such as erosion control, nutrient cycling, climate regulation andwater treatment, which were among the highest contributors of the total ESVs. However, the value of food production service function consistently increased during the study periods although not drastically. All in all, it must be considered a minimum estimate of ESV changes due to uncertainties in the value coefficients used in this study. We conclude that the decline of ESVs reflected the effects of ecological degradation in the studied landscape and suggest further studies to explore future options and formulate intervention strategies.

JO  - CEUR Workshop Proceedings
PY  - 2016
AB  - Robustness is one of the important issues in watermarking. In particular, robustness against JPEG compression is especially actual. Nowadays there are many different applications requiring image compression, such as Internet, satellite imaging, remote sensing, multimedia, preservation of art work and so on. In this paper, an effective watermarking technique based on the genetic algorithm optimization and even-odd modulation in frequency domain is presented. The genetic algorithm finds the optimum watermark strength and location for its embedding in a spectrum of the cover image. Experimental results have demonstrated high values of robustness and fidelity of the proposed scheme. Copyright © by the paper's authors.

TI  - Workflow, Time And Patient Satisfaction From The Perspectives Of Home Monitoring
JO  - EUROPACE
PY  - 2013
AB  - Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices improves device surveillance and patient clinical management. The greatest challenge in implementing remote monitoring in standard practice is the need to develop new organizational models, capable of combining clinical effectiveness, low resource consumption, and patient acceptance. Since 2005, we developed a new model based on 'Primary Nursing' in which each patient is assigned to a nurse responsible for continuity of care. The model is essentially based on a cooperative interaction between the roles of an expert reference nurse and a responsible physician with an agreed list of respective tasks and responsibilities. After a pilot experience, the model was tested in a wide registry, the HomeGuide Registry, in which 1650 patients were enrolled. In this setting, remote monitoring sensitivity in detecting major cardiovascular events was very high (84\%) with a positive predictive value of 97\%. Overall, 95\% of asymptomatic and 73\% of actionable events were detected during remote monitoring sessions with a median reaction time of 3 days. Manpower was remarkably low: 55.5 min per health personnel per month every 100 patients. The strongest points of this model include strict definition of workflow, early reaction, traceability, continuity of care, maintaining human relationship with the patient. This model has been tested successfully even in a multicentre setting in the Model Project Monitor Centre study, in which one monitor centre screened daily remote monitoring data from nine satellite clinics.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Satellite Data For Carbon Storage Mapping Of Green Space In A Fast Growing Development Corridor In Malaysia
JO  - 37th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2016
PY  - 2016
AB  - Disturbances such as deforestation and land use change on natural vegetation have caused carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere which contributes to global warming and climate change. Malaysia has started to take necessary steps to mitigate the potential impact of increased CO2 and integrating the green infrastructure into urban planning is a way to go. Green space in urban environment provides a variety of benefits to the community by sequestrating carbon, absorbing urban emissions and producing oxygen. In this study we quantified the carbon storage capacity of various green spaces, namely forests, mangroves and urban parks by biometric measurements and remote sensing techniques at a rapidly developing economy region in Iskandar Malaysia (IM) in the southern Peninsular Malaysia that covers an area of 2,217 km2. Satellite imageries such as RapidEye and Advanced Land Observing Satellite phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) were used for mapping the carbon content of different vegetation in IM. The spatial distribution of carbon storage shows that mangroves contribute the largest amount of carbon storage in IM with 0.437M t C and this is mainly due to their vast area (8382 ha). This is followed by tropical forest (0.185M t C). However, tropical forest has the highest carbon density with 161.7 tC ha-1 compared to mangroves (52.1 tC ha-1). In general, trees in urban parks have lower carbon storage (ranging between 32.63 tC ha-1 to 48.81 tC ha-1) compared to forests and mangrove. In total, these vegetation types in IM remove ∼2.29 M tCO2eq. Green space in IM was found to remove about 3% of carbon emitted to the air in IM. These results suggest that the government must make firm policies to increase more green cover in the urban areas and to preserve the existing green space for improving environmental quality for people and supporting biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Statistical Object-Based Method For Forest Change Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
JO  - Linye Kexue/Scientia Silvae Sinicae
PY  - 2017
AB  - Objective: Collecting forest-change information accurately, quickly and efficiently to update forest resource databases in time is critically important for scientific decision-making of forest management and forestry sustainable development, and has long been one of the major technical challenges in forest resource management. Method: In this paper, an object-based statistical method was applied to detect forest changes in a study site located in Shangsi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region where the forest cover has experienced frequent changes over time associated with a large number of parcels with relatively small sizes. High spatial resolution satellite images of ZY-3, GF-1 and the vector sub-compartment map of forest distribution were served as the data sources. Object features were extracted by using multi-resolution segmentation of satellite images accompanying with the thematic map. As the frequencies of the difference of the objects' mean gray value and standard deviation of the two-temporal images were approximate the normal distributions, chi-square distribution statistic was using with the difference between object mean value and standard deviation. Therefore the change objects with abnormal statistics were flagged one by one with a statistical procedure of iterative trimming. Result: The results indicated that for a given confidence level, the detected number of change objects decreased rapidly as the iteration number increased. When the confidence level was set at 0.95, 0.98, 0.99 and 0.999, the corresponding changed objects were labeled through 25, 23, 20 and 15 iterations, respectively. Along with changes in the confidence levels from 0.95 to 0.99, the omission rate increased, as a result, the commission rate decreased and the overall accuracy increased. The best result was achieved with the confidence level was 0.99 as the overall accuracy was 92.6% and the Kappa was 0.764 8. Conclusion: The advantage of the method proposed in this paper was object-based and statistically driven, directly detected forest changes from the dataset generated from the image segmentation, did not rely on external information and human intervention, could be executed automatically in the entire procedure, and generated satisfactory results. Furthermore, this approach was potentially an ideal method for forest change detection. © 2017, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae. All right reserved.

TI  - Evaluating Srtm And Aster Dem Accuracy For The Broader Area Of Sparti, Greece
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2007
AB  - One of the major projects of the Institute of Geology & Mineral Exploration (IGME) is called "Urban Geology". In the frame of that project there is need for a high accuracy DEM covering the whole country. The DEM should be used for the orthorectification of high resolution images and other applications such as slope map creation, environmental planning et.c. ASTER and SRTM are two possible sources for DEM covering the whole country. According to the specifications the ASTER vertical accuracy of DEM is about 20m with 95% confidence while the horizontal geolocation accuracy appears to be better than 50 m. More recent studies have shown that the use of GCP's resulted in a plannimetric accuracy of 15 m and in a near pixel size vertical accuracy. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), used an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) instrument to produce a near-global digital elevation map of the earth's land surface with 16 m absolute vertical height accuracy at 30 meter postings. An SRTM 3-arc-second product (90m resolution) is available for the entire world. In this paper we examine the accuracy of SRTM and ASTER DEMs in comparison to the accuracy of the 1/5.000 topographic maps. The area of study is the broader area of Sparti, Greece. After a first control for random or systematic errors a statistical analysis was done. A DEM derived from digitized contours of the 1:5.000 topographic maps was created and compared with ASTER and SRTM derived DEMs. Fifty-five points of known elevation have been used to estimate the accuracy of these three DEMs. Slope and aspect maps were created and compared. The elevation difference between the three DEMs was calculated. 2D RMSE, correlation and the percentile value were also computed. The three DEMs were used for the orthorectification of very high resolution data and the final orthophotos were compared.

TI  - Analysis Of Navigation Performance With Lunar Gnss Evolution
JO  - Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting of The Institute of Navigation, ITM
PY  - 2022
AB  - The gradual expansion of infrastructure on and around the Moon is key to establishing the long-term exploration of the Moon through e.g., NASA's Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload service missions. Current missions are largely dependent on the support of the Deep Space Network (DSN) for communication and navigation services at lunar distances. The future increase in demand for these services is likely to be beyond the capabilities of the DSN, which is operating close to capacity. Despite recent work showing that Earthbound Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals can be received at lunar distances, these signals are mostly relevant for time synchronization, since the poor Dilution of Precision (DOP) severely limits their usefulness for precise navigation purposes. In this work, we analyze the navigation performance of two 24-satellite Lunar GNSS constellations. The first architecture was identified in a previous study, using a multi-objective evolutionary optimization framework. It consists of a Walker constellation in near-circular polar orbits at an altitude of ~2 lunar radii that requires modest station-keeping delta-V. The second architecture is based on eccentric repeat ground-track orbits that are shown to have long-term stability and are similar to other architectures proposed in the literature. It is shown that the ISECG absolute positioning goal of 40cm can be achieved by a sub-constellation of architecture 1 with at least 16 satellites if pseudorange and delta range measurements are used. The economic analysis shows that a 16-satellite sub-constellation of architecture 1 can outperform the 24-satellite constellation of architecture 2 while being deployed at a similar cost. an 8-satellite Lunar GNSS constellation would outperform the position accuracy of DSN tracking assuming one 8-hour pass/day. It is estimated that the cost of an 8-satellite Lunar GNSS constellation could be amortized in 15 years by DSN tracking cost savings alone. © 2022 Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting of The Institute of Navigation, ITM.

TI  - A Long-Term And Comprehensive Assessment Of Urbanization-Induced Impacts On Ecosystem Services In The Capital City Of India
JO  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Globally, the present rate of urbanization in mega-urban centers is altering ecosystem functions and resultant ecosystem services of the landscapes. The natural and semi-natural ecosystems within the urban regions are under threat of loss and degradation. Estimating the economic values of the ecosystem services obtained from these natural and semi-natural ecosystems can play an important role in urban policy and decision making. The main objective of this paper is to quantify the changes in ecosystem service values (ESVs) in response to land use land cover (LULC) dynamics and urbanization in the capital city of India, Delhi. Using satellite imageries over the past two decades (1998-2018) we show the estimated changes in ESVs with the global value coefficient (VC) of proximate biomes. The study relies on benefit transfer approach of ESs valuation wherein the ESVs of proximate biomes, derived from one/multiple study site, are used in assessing ESVs at another site. For determining the reliability of the study, a sensitivity analysis is performed to check the effectiveness of VC. The results show a total decline of ecosystem services (ESs) in monetary terms by US\$ 7.614 million ha(-1) year(-1) from 1998 to 2018 with prominent changes in LULC. The change analysis shows a loss (US\$ 3.6141 million) of regulatory and provisional services. The prominent part (US\$ 2.675 million) of this loss was due to decline in city forest cover by 6426.09 ha. The city has benefitted from initiatives in implementation of bio-diversity parks and plantation drives, but also suffers widespread loss of forest over the years. The ESs monitoring at the city administrative divisions (i.e. district-wise) highlights the importance of conservation of natural ecosystems within the urban area with distribution equity. The results provide insights that should be considered for urban planning in order to protect natural resources, ESs, and thus overall well-being of residents.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-2 And Landsat 8 For Burn Severity Mapping In Western North America
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Accurate assessment of burn severity is a critical need for an improved understanding of fire behavior and ecology and effective post-fire management. Although NASA Landsat satellites have a long history of use for remotely sensed mapping of burn severity, the recently launched (2015 and 2017) European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite constellation offers increased temporal and spatial resolution with global coverage, combined with free data access. Evaluations of burn severity derived from Landsat and Sentinel generally show comparable results, but these studies only assessed a small number of fires with limited field data. We used 912 ground calibration plots from 26 fires that burned between 2016 and 2019 in western North America to compare Sentinel- and Landsat-derived burn severity estimates with the field-based composite burn index. We mapped burn severity using two methods; the well-established paired scene approach, in which a single pre- and post-fire scene are selected for each fire, and also a mean image compositing approach that automatically integrates multiple scenes using the cloud-based remote sensing platform Google Earth Engine. We found that Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity, particularly when using atmospherically corrected Sentinel imagery. Additionally, we tested the effects of mapping burn severity at Sentinel's finer spatial resolution (10 m) on estimates of the spatial complexity of stand-replacing fire, resulting in a 5\% average reduction per-fire in area mapped as high-severity patch interiors (24,273 ha total) compared to mapping at the resolution of Landsat (30 m). These findings suggest Sentinel may improve ecological discrimination of fine-scale fire effects, but also warrant caution when comparing estimates of burn severity spatial patterns derived at different resolutions. Overall, these results indicate that burn severity mapping will benefit substantially from the integration of Sentinel imagery through increased imagery availability, and that Sentinel's higher spatial resolution improves opportunities for examining finer-scale fire effects across ecosystems.

TI  - Does Mangrove Plantation Reduce Coastal Erosion? Assessment From The West Coast Of India
JO  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
PY  - 2020
AB  - Mangroves are believed to stabilize the coastlines by controlling erosion and facilitating sediment deposition. Coastal managers often plant mangroves to counter coastal erosion. The state of Gujarat in West India has planted thousands of hectares of mangroves over the years, and control of coastal erosion has been one of the prime reasons of plantation. This study performed a statistical assessment of the effect of the planted mangroves on the coastline changes in the state from 1990 to 2013. The study utilized geographic information system and remote sensing data to demarcate the areas under erosion and accretion during this period, and then compared these changes with the change in mangrove cover using statistical models. This cross-sectional analysis was conducted at the level of a tehsil, an administrative unit below a district. The results show that mangrove plantation did not decrease erosion, not even after normalizing the coastline changes by the length of the coastline and using controls for physical and anthropogenic features of the tehsils. Tehsils with increased mangrove cover witnessed both increased erosion and accretion, although the latter was much higher. The geophysical features of the area appeared to be the main determinants of coastline changes in Gujarat.

TI  - Life On The Edge: Reproductive Mode And Rate Of Invasive <I>Phragmites Australis</I> Patch Expansion
JO  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
PY  - 2016
AB  - The dynamics of plant invasions from initial colonization through patch expansion are driven in part by mode of reproduction, i.e., sexual (seed) and asexual (clonal fragments and expansion) means. Expansion of existing patches-both rate and mode of spread into a matrix of varying conditions-is important for predicting potential invader impacts. In this study, we used fine-scale genetic assessments and remote sensing to describe both the rate and mode of expansion for 20 Phragmites australis patches in flooded and unflooded wetland units on the Great Salt Lake, UT. We found that the majority of Phragmites patch expansion occurred via clonal spread but we also documented instances of (potentially episodic) seedling recruitment. The mode of patch expansion, inferred from patch edge genet richness, was unrelated to flooding in the wetland unit in the preceding growing season. The rate of Phragmites patch expansion varied from 0.09 to 0.35 year(-1) and was unrelated to the mode of spread. In six patches monitored across two years, monoclonal patches stayed monoclonal, whereas patches with higher genet richness had a marked increase in diversity in the second year. The findings of the present study suggest how this partially clonal species can exploit the benefits of both sexual (i.e., genetic recombination, widespread dispersal, colonization of new areas) and asexual reproduction (i.e., stability of established clones suited to local environmental conditions) to become one of the most successful wetland plant invaders. To control this species, both forms of reproduction need to be fully addressed through targeted management actions.

TI  - Enabling Efficient Service Function Chains At Terrestrial-Satellite Hybrid Cloud Networks
JO  - IEEE Network
PY  - 2019
AB  - The great improvements in both satellite and terrestrial networks have motivated the academic and industrial communities to rethink their integration. As a result, there is an increasing interest in new-generation hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks, where sufficient flexibility should be enabled to deploy customized SFCs to satisfy the growing diversity of user needs. However, it is still challenging to achieve such a nice vision, since many key issues remain unaddressed comprehensively such as framework design, communication procedures and resource optimization. Therefore, in this article, we focus on how to efficiently deploy customized SFCs at terrestrial-satellite hybrid cloud networks. In particular, we first propose an elastic framework used for SFC deployment at clouds, and second propose an efficient SFC mapping approach for improvement of system resource utilization. Finally, we verify the proposed framework at a proof-of-concept prototype via a number of use cases, and evaluate the proposed mapping approach through extensive simulations based on a real-world topology. Related experimental and simulation results have confirmed the feasibility and benefits of our proposed framework and mapping approach. © 2019 IEEE

TI  - Seasonality And Aquatic Metacommunity Assemblage In Three Abandoned Gold Mining Ponds In The Southwestern Amazon, Madre De Dios (Peru)
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Worldwide demand for gold has caused increased extractive activities in the Western Amazon, resulting in a wide-scale transformation of the Madre de Dios river basin (Peru) due to Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM). These impactful activities profoundly affect the natural landscape and hydroscape as terra firme forest and floodplain habitats are deforested leaving a vast landscape of abandoned ponds that are subsequently colonized from surrounding water bodies. However, the metacommunity dynamics of these emergent networks of connected wetlands and their environmental drivers remain virtually unknown. Here, we present a one-year (May 2017?May 2018) study conducted to assess the composition, abundance and trophic structure of fish assemblages in three abandoned ASGM ponds and their interactions in relation to those of other freshwater groups (macroinvertebrates, phytoplankton and zooplankton). We aimed to determine the influence of environmental parameters on community composition, focused on flood pulse influence (FPI), seasonality, and to identify indicators for predicting aquatic communities? assemblages. A remarkably abundance and diversity were found totaling 4601 sampled fish from 6 orders, 27 families, 68 genera and 103 species, as well as 87 macoinvertebrate, 71 phytoplankton and 44 zooplankton taxa. The two FPI ponds showed a more stable fish trophic structure throughout the year than the unique non-FPI, probably due to the floods provision of buffer against the lack of resources that occurs during the dry season. Conversely, fish of higher trophic levels were not detected during the dry and transition-to-wet seasons in the non-FPI pond surveyed. Community trajectory analysis showed greater stability of fish assemblages in the non-FPI pond compared to the FPI ponds, which experienced larger disturbance of environmental parameters and biotic inputs during flooding events. Detrended correspondence analysis showed floods as the key factor influencing aquatic communities and species accumulation. However, whereas floods had a large influence on fish and macroinvertebrates, seasonality was the main driver for plankton. FPI ponds showed six-fold higher fish and macroinvertebrate species richness than non-FPI ones, while plankton showed an opposite trend. FPI was the main factor determining the taxonomic composition of fish, followed by dissolved oxygen. Macroinvertebrates were also affected by FPI together with pH and the presence of grassed banks, while conductivity determined phytoplankton composition. Our study presents novel evidence on the highly heterogeneous communities of ASGM abandoned ponds, highlighting their important ecological value and potential role in providing of ecosystem services currently overlooked from conservation policies and management of the aquatic resources.

TI  - Effects Of Subsidy And Regulation Policy On Soil And Water Resources Of Cotton Planted Lands In Harran Plain, Turkey
JO  - Land Use Policy
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) provides essential raw material used in the textile, feed, and vegetable oil sectors. Therefore, it is a strategic crop for agricultural, economic, and political strategies around the world. Accurate monitoring of the changes in the cotton production patterns is crucial for decision-makers. Turkey is among the top ten cotton producers and ranks fourth in the world for cotton imports. One third of the total cotton production in Turkey comes from the southeastern Anatolia region of the country. This study analyzed the impact of subsidy and regulation policies on fluctuations in cotton production areas and soil and water quality in Harran Plains, southeastern Anatolia region Turkey. Time-series (between 2016 and 2021) satellite images were utilized to determine actual crop rotation in the study area. Turkish Government implemented a new rule for crop subsidies in 2020 which stated that a farmer will be eligible for subsidy for two consecutive years; however the subsidy will not be paid if the same crop is planted in the third year. Cotton was cultivated in 83 % of the Harran plains prior to new subsidy regulation, which decreased to 26 % after the new regulation. Sudden decrease in cotton cultivation area clearly indicated that farmers need public support to cover the costs in agricultural production. The Gross Production Value (BPV) for each crop was calculated to determine the impact of subsidy regulation on economic value of crops in the rotation.The GPV in 2020 was 2.903,7 $ ha−1 that was 33.6 % and 20.5 % lower than 2019 and 2021, respectively. The results indicated that crop subsidies significantly altered the crop selection behavior of farmers. Water requirement of crops in rotation between 2016 and 2021 was calculated to assess the effects of subsidy changes on water consumption. Cotton cultivation over a large part of the plains during the same season caused excessive water consumption, rise in groundwater level over time, soil salinity and severe water erosion. However, cotton cultivation area as well as water consumption in Harran plain new significantly decreased with the new subsidy regulation; therefore, water consumption in 2020 was the lowest among the time frame evaluated. Total sediment losses through surface runoff from the Harran Plain was estimated as 0.83 tons ha−1 per year. The results revealed that subsidies exert significant impacts on the gross production value in the region, amount of irrigation water consumed, and quality of soil and water resources in addition to the impact on the decision of farmers for crop selection. © 2022

TI  - Assessment Of High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery For Monitoring Riparian Vegetation: Riverine Management In The Smallholding
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Riverine habitats are essential ecotones that bridge aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, providing multiple ecosystem services. This study analyses the potential use of high-resolution satellite imagery, provided by the WorldView-2 satellite, in order to assess its viability for monitoring riparian ecosystems. It is performed by calculating the riparian strip quality index (RSQI) and calibrating it with the riparian quality index (QBR). The methodology was implemented in the Umia River, which is characterised by elevated anthropogenic pressures (located in the northwest of Spain). The results obtained by the method have a 92\% of veracity and a kappa coefficient of 0.88. The average quality value obtained for the RSQI index was 71.57, while the average value for the QBR was 55.88. This difference could be attributed to the fact that the former does not differ between autochthonous and non-autochthonous vegetation. The areas with more accurate mapping corresponded to stretches of vegetation with optimal cover (80-50\%), with good connectivity with the adjacent forest ecosystem and few or no presence of invasive plants. The worst-scoring sites had the next characteristics: low connectivity (< 10\%), low forest cover (< 10\%) and a higher presence of invasive plants. The degradation of vegetation could be explained by the presence of agriculture and deficient land use rationing caused by the type of ownership of the study area. The application of this index through satellite images will facilitate the environmental governance of multiple ecosystems and in special riparian ecosystems, obtaining a quick and objective methodology, easily replicable in other basins.

TI  - Synergy And Regulation Of The South China Karst Wh Site Integrity Protection And The Buffer Zone Agroforestry Development
JO  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Natural World Heritage site (NWH) has a dual role of protection and utilization. The buffer zone of the South China Karst (SCK) World Heritage (WH) site is scattered with village dwellings, which adds pressure to preserve the outstanding universal value (OUV) and integrity protection of the WH site. The development of agroforestry is an essential means to maintain rural livelihoods, protect the ecological environment, and realize the protection and development of the heritage site. Studying the synergy and regulation of the heritage site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development is essential. This study takes the Shibing and Libo-Huanjiang karst WH as the study areas and administrative villages as the evaluation unit. From 2020 to 2023, through data methods such as remote sensing data interpretation, information data survey and collection, comprehensive index analysis, coupling coordination degree model, and GIS spatial analysis, a systematic study was conducted on the basic frontier research, synergy relationship, and regulation of the heritage site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development. The results demonstrate that the Shibing and Libo-Huanjiang karst WH sites integrity protection and agroforestry development in the buffer zone have a high coupling degree and a good coupling coordination relationship. This reveals that the heritage site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development are an interconnected and mutually influential whole, which the synergistic relationship between them is developing in a positive direction; The buffer zone agroforestry development lags behind the heritage site integrity protection, based on which proposed the regulatory measures for the synergy development of the heritage site integrity protection and agroforestry development in the buffer zone. The findings in this study provide references for the synergies development of the WH karst site integrity protection and agroforestry development in the buffer zone.

TI  - Integrating Research Using Animal-Borne Telemetry With The Needs Of Conservation Management
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
PY  - 2017
AB  - 1. Animal-borne telemetry has revolutionized our ability to study animal movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing environments and the threats that animals are experiencing. While there will always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to make informed management decisions. 2. Here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal telemetry devices can influence conservation. We then discuss two critical questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied conservation decision-making: (i) Would my choice of action change if I had more data? (ii) Is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect more data? 3. Policy implications. To answer questions about integrating telemetry-derived data with applied conservation, we suggest the use of value of information analysis to quantitatively assess the return-on-investment of animal telemetry-derived data for conservation decision-making.

TI  - Intuitive Visualization Of Pareto Frontier For Multi-Objective Optimization In N-Dimensional Performance Space
JO  - Collection of Technical Papers - 10th AIAA/ISSMO Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization Conference
PY  - 2004
AB  - A visualization methodology is presented in which a Pareto Frontier can be visualized in an intuitive and straightforward manner for an n-dimensional performance space. Based on this visualization, it is possible to quickly identify 'good' regions of the performance and optimal design spaces for a multi-objective optimization application, regardless of space complexity. Visualizing Pareto solutions for more than three objectives has long been a significant challenge to the multi-objective optimization community. The Hyper-space Diagonal Counting (HSDC) method described here enables the lossless visualization to be implemented. The proposed method requires no dimension fixing. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of visualizing n-f space (i.e. for more than three objective functions in a multiobjective optimization problem). The visualization is shown to aid in the final decision of what potential optimal design point should be chosen amongst all possible Pareto solutions.

TI  - Prediction Of Soil Organic Carbon And The C:n Ratio On A National Scale Using Machine Learning And Satellite Data: A Comparison Between Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 And Landsat-8 Images
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) are the main indicators of soil quality and health and play an important role in maintaining soil quality. Together with Landsat, the improved spatial and temporal resolution Sentinel sensors provide the potential to investigate soil information on various scales. We analyzed and compared the potential of satellite sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3) with various spatial and temporal resolutions to predict SOC content and C:N ratio in Switzerland. Modeling was carried out at four spatial resolutions (800 m, 400 m, 100 m and 20 m) using three machine learning techniques: support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF). Soil prediction models were generated in these three machine learners in which 150 soil samples and different combinations of environmental data (topography, climate and satellite imagery) were used as inputs. The prediction results were evaluated by cross-validation. Our results revealed that the model type, modeling resolution and sensor selection greatly influenced outputs. By comparing satellite-based SOC models, the models built by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 performed the best and the worst, respectively. C:N ratio prediction models based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 showed better results than Sentinel-3. However, the prediction models built by Sentinel-3 had competitive or better accuracy at coarse resolutions. The BRT models constructed by all available predictors at a resolution of 100 m obtained the best prediction accuracy of SOC content and C:N ratio; their relative improvements (in terms of R2) compared to models without remote sensing data input were 29.1% and 58.4%, respectively. The results of variable importance revealed that remote sensing variables were the best predictors for our soil prediction models. The predicted maps indicated that the higher SOC content was mainly distributed in the Alps, while the C:N ratio shared a similar distribution pattern with land use and had higher values in forest areas. This study provides useful indicators for a more effective modeling of soil properties on various scales based on satellite imagery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Industrial Forestry Negatively Affects Small-Farms Honey Production In South-Central Chile: Evidence From A Landscape Scale
JO  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH
PY  - 2023
AB  - Land use and cover change have a high influence on bee species, where honey bees (Apis mellifera) could be affected in terms of resources, dispersal, and habitat. However, the influence of landscape context on honey productivity has been scarcely explored in comparison with population parameters, which is an essential topic for the economic development of rural communities based on apiculture. Here, we tested the hypothesis if honey production decreases with the increase of exotic forest plantations in the landscape as the cover of native forest decreases, vegetation and soils become increasingly degraded. We compiled data on honey productivity for two years (2018 and 2019) of small-scale honey production in 17 landscapes of 1 km radii (Curanilahue state in south-central Chile). Then, the landscapes were characterized by using remote sensing techniques, including biophysical and compositional landscape variables. Finally, Generalized Linear Mixed Models were implemented to explore the relationship between landscape variables and honey productivity. We identified a positive relationship between honey productivity with built cover and grassland cover. On the other hand, a negative relationship was found between honey production and net primary production, exotic forest plantations, and tree senescence index. Our results provide new insights into the landscape-scale drivers of hive productivity in rural landscapes of south-central Chile.

TI  - Oxygen And Hydrogen Isotopic Water Characteristics Of The Aral Sea, Central Asia
JO  - Journal of Marine Systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Aral Sea, located in a semi-arid environment, undergoes substantial annual (1200 mm/yr) and decadal lake-level fluctuations due to extreme seasonality in evaporation and precipitation along with steadily reduced river discharge. To trace the source of the lake water and understand the internal dynamics of the lake, we used oxygen and deuterium isotope composition of the lake water collected at different depths during spring and autumn from 2004 to 2006. We collected data from both the western (W) and eastern (E) basins of the Large Aral Sea as well as the channel connecting the two basins. The oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of the lake water vary widely (+ 4.6 to - 5.3‰ and - 48 to + 11‰, respectively). We further measured isotopic ratios of groundwater leakage near the shoreline of the W basin of the Large Aral Sea and released in an artesian well on the Kulandy Peninsula. These ratios range from - 16 to + 3.4‰ (δ18O) and - 120 to + 2.2‰ (δD). The river water displays ratios of - 12‰ (δ18O) and - 81.3‰ (δD). Precipitation from winter and early spring 2006 exhibit δ18O values of - 14‰ (snow) and + 0.2‰ (rain) and δD values of - 97‰ (snow) and + 3.6‰ (rain). The oxygen and hydrogen isotope snapshots show that in addition to evaporation, groundwater effluent flows at different depths are major contributors to the lake in spring and autumn. The d-excess, ranging between - 25‰ (lake water) and + 10‰ (groundwater), further demonstrates the impact of both effluent groundwater and evaporation on the isotopic composition of the lake water. Thus, stable isotope ratios can provide a first insight into seasonally triggered hydrologic interactions in the western part of the endorheic Aral Sea region. Remote sensing studies prove that major groundwater leakage occurs along the entire shoreline, except for the western shore where spatial resolution was too low. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Safety Leading To An Integrated National Airspace System (Nas) - Meeting The Challenges With A Comprehensive Safety Case
JO  - AUVSI Unmanned Systems 2013
PY  - 2013
AB  - Integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems into the National Airspace System (NAS) continues to be plagued by safety challenges, the most critical of them being the ability of a UAS to avoid colliding with a manned aircraft and other obstacles during flight. Regulations governing integration of UAS have been the goal of various industry and government sponsored working groups for well over a decade; and still those regulations do not exist. Operators and equipment manufacturers have not yet been provided with the standards and guidance they need to develop systems to ensure that UASs can safely enter the same airspace and operate with manned aircraft. The ongoing transition from the current ground radar based air traffic control system to the space based Next Generation (NextGEN) air traffic management system offers significant opportunity to improve safety, while also increasing capacity that can accommodate the introduction of UASs into the NAS. With ADS-B, the backbone of NextGEN, providing GPS position accuracy for any participating ("cooperative") aircraft, both manned and unmanned aircraft reap the safety benefits from state of the art technology that is substantially better than radar positioning. Additional safety benefits that accompany NextGEN technology include the ability of the FAA to transmit traffic data, weather information and other important messages to ADS-B receivers, vastly improving situational and environmental awareness for all participants. Taken together, the introduction of new technology as the air traffic management system evolves into NextGEN presents a historic opportunity to increase safety for all who use the NAS, especially those who choose to "participate" with ADS-B, while also safely integrating UASs. Because not all aircraft are required to " participate" by electronically identifying themselves and their position - even in NextGEN - this paper reports results of a pilots survey, demonstrating their support for and use of electronic technologies that improve safety; also that cost is a critical factor. An affordable means for all aircraft to be participating in NextGEN is clearly the safest, most direct route for integration of UASs into the NAS.

AB  - This article presents evidence for the positive effects of digitalization on the institutional capacity of key stakeholders, which is a necessary precondition for narrowing the existing implementation gap in European Union environmental law. Based on document analysis and semistructured interviews with actors involved in the implementation process, four main factors are considered. First, the Commission's institutional capacity benefits from a change of focus of the reporting system from textual information to data and indicators and by the development of new data harvesting methods. Second, subnational actors have improved their institutional capacity through knowledge transfers and strategic planning, facilitated by better information and communication technology and statistical data. Third, inspection networks benefitted from technical advances, such as the access to satellite images, presenting new opportunities for the detection of environmental crimes, and new software programs facilitating risk-based inspections. Finally, citizens' and nongovernmental organizations' improved access to data and to justice in environmental matters strengthened their monitoring capacities.

TI  - Watershed Characteristics, Land Use And Fabric: The Application Of Remote Sensing And Geographical Information Systems
JO  - Lakes and Reservoirs: Science, Policy and Management for Sustainable Use
PY  - 2005
AB  - Integrated watershed assessment, especially relying on remote sensing (RS), is a newly established procedure in developing countries. It is proving to be a major component in river-basin environmental management. The recurrence of environmental problems in the Akkar El Kabir River watershed, as well as the lack of proper data on sources and sinks of pollutants, and the extent of human interference, led to the current study. Advanced geoinformation tools, such as RS and geographical information systems (GIS), prove to be a valuable asset in securing data on the fabric of the Akkar watershed in relation to its natural setting and anthropic interference. This is particularly true in the current study as the river constitutes the boundary between Lebanon and Syria. Remote sensing captures the watershed characteristics and land use on both sides without constraints. The natural fabric includes geology, drainage, hydrogeology, forest and soil. The anthropic fabric includes settlements, utilities, roads, agriculture and land use. If it were not for geoinformation techniques, the task of securing such data would be difficult. Also, these techniques show the impact of malpractices from excessive human interference that result in degradation of land and water quality. Changes in the watershed, such as environmental deterioration, are observed as water pollution, soil erosion, forest decline and socioeconomic imbalance. Obviously, this is the outcome of malpractices in a multisectorial system. A major challenge for RS and GIS is to quantify, model and predict, if possible, the extent of these changes. Remote sensing inherently captures the impact of interaction between nature and human beings. Detection of change is a major indicator that RS can contribute to the evaluation of the state of the environment. The application of it on this watershed reveals that significant changes have occurred over the last 10-15 years, most of which are anthropic.

TI  - The Origin And Research Progress Of Big Earth Data
JO  - Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin
PY  - 2024
AB  - The information age has been a product of, and has been fueled by, the process of decades-long digitization, consequently transforming human societies globally. Big data is a revolutionary innovation born out of the information age that has allowed the development of many new methods in scientific research, new ways of thinking about discovery, and a new strategic high ground for knowledge economies and national interests. In the context of big data, scientific big data was proposed in 2013 to represent a paradigm shift from model-driven science to data-driven science. This transition challenges the traditional scientific research methodologies relying on observation-based science, emphasizing the search for relationships within massive datasets. This approach allows for exploration and discovery without heavy reliance on preexisting models or prior knowledge. Scientific big data exhibits complexity, comprehensiveness, and globalization, driving a shift towards multidisciplinary approaches and international collaboration. The digital revolution is providing unprecedented access to unconventional data that quantifies societal trends at a scale not possible before. The continuous development of big data technology has brought about “Big Earth Data”, referring to big data with spatial attributes mainly generated from large-scale scientific experiment devices, detection equipment, sensors, socio-economic observations, and computer simulation processes in space and on the ground. The aim of Big Earth Data science is to significantly enhance the information value of these discrete sources of data through proper integration and interpretation. Big Earth Data provides an opportunity to fill in various gaps in data and information on global challenges, in particular sustainable development goals (SDGs), and key insights into socio-environmental interconnections. Big Earth Data, unlike conventional big data, gives geographic context and naturally emphasizes the utility of large volumes of Earth observation data and its interoperability with conventional big data systems and methods. To integrate cutting-edge science and technology in Earth, space, and information sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched its leading strategic science and technology initiative, the “Big Earth Data Science Engineering Program” (CASEarth). CASEarth paved the way for Big Earth Data to serve the development of Earth science and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. CASEarth also facilitated the establishment of the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (CBAS). An important objective of CASEarth is to scientifically understand, model, and apply the process of transforming data into information, and to provide knowledge for global sustainable development. This was a response to the important realization that SDGs have been restricted due to missing data, development disequilibrium, and association and mutual restriction between SDGs. CASEarth is working to integrate ever-increasing data sources to significantly fill various gaps in data and information on global challenges for the SDGs.

TI  - Multiband Sar Data For Rangeland Pasture Monitoring
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Rangelands in Australia cover approximately 80 percent of the continent and include a diverse group of relatively undisturbed ecosystems such as tropical savannas, woodlands, shrublands and grasslands. It is important to monitor and understand change in the rangelands so that effective actions can be taken to maintain ecological, economic and social values in Australia. Efficient use of feed resources in the livestock industries of Australia is a major factor in determining farm profitability and sustainability. With limited information, many producers forego potential production because of ineffective management of their feed resources. Further, poor management can also lead to environmental degradation. Therefore, CSIRO have invested to investigate, develop and validate new methodologies for integration of remote sensing data with in-situ field measurements, in order to map the dynamics in aboveground plant biomass in forests, crops, grassland and rangelands of Australia. Pasture biomass mapping is a main component of this project given rangelands the majority of Australia. Due to good sensitive to diverse rangelands in tropical and subtropical regions, multi-band SAR data for pasture mapping are investigated in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Relating Vegetation Dynamics To Climate Variables In Taiwan Using 1982-2012 Ndvi3g Data
JO  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2016
AB  - This research aims to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics and associated climate variables in Taiwan by utilizing mean-variance analysis (MVA), relative directional persistence analysis, and Pearson's product moment correlation analysis on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived NDVI3g data from 1982 to 2012. The results indicate a slightly increasing mean-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value with a relatively higher variance during the 1990s and lower variance during the 2000s, which may be explained by the observed fluctuation in precipitation. Additionally, NDVI patterns are identified as increasing in the first half of the year and decreasing in the second half of the year. Spatially, decreasing patterns are observed in all regions except that the northern counties exhibit an increasing NDVI pattern supported by the observed increase in precipitation. Moreover, sunshine duration and temperature are positively correlated with NDVI, whereas precipitation and cloud amount exhibit a negative correlation with NDVI in Taiwan. In the context of global environmental change, this research highlights the utility of applying a combined spatial-temporal approach to remote sensing products. This is an approach with potential applications such as landscape management, conservation practice, and water resource management for policy makers and stakeholders in and beyond Taiwan.

TI  - Geospacelab: Python Package For Managing And Visualizing Data In Space Physics
JO  - Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the space physics community, processing and combining observational and modeling data from various sources is a demanding task because they often have different formats and use different coordinate systems. The Python package GeospaceLAB has been developed to provide a unified, standardized framework to process data. The package is composed of six core modules, including DataHub as the data manager, Visualization for generating publication quality figures, Express for higher-level interfaces of DataHub and Visualization, SpaceCoordinateSystem for coordinate system transformations, Toolbox for various utilities, and Configuration for preferences. The core modules form a standardized framework for downloading, storing, post-processing and visualizing data in space physics. The object-oriented design makes the core modules of GeospaceLAB easy to modify and extend. So far, GeospaceLAB can process more than twenty kinds of data products from nine databases, and the number will increase in the future. The data sources include, e.g., measurements by EISCAT incoherent scatter radars, DMSP, SWARM, and Grace satellites, OMNI solar wind data, and GITM simulations. In addition, the package provides an interface for the users to add their own data products. Hence, researchers can easily collect, combine, and view multiple kinds of data for their work using GeospaceLAB. Combining data from different sources will lead to a better understanding of the physics of the studied phenomena and may lead to new discoveries. GeospaceLAB is an open source software, which is hosted on GitHub. We welcome everyone in the community to contribute to its future development.

TI  - Robust Approach For Optimal Positioning And Ranking Potential Rainwater Harvesting Structure (Rwh): A Case Study Of Iraq
JO  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2017
AB  - Rainwater harvesting (RWH) structure is considered as the best solution to conserve water for arid regions. The selection of RWH location is based on several key determinants such as hydrology, environment, topography, and socio-economic. This study proposed a robust methodology to identify and select the location of RWH using geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) with multi-criteria decision techniques in areas where data are scarce. Several thematic maps were extracted such as vegetation cover, soil group, slope, land use, and digital elevation (DEM). The RWH sites were ranked based on four major indexes: evaporation, cost-benefit, sediment, and hydrological index. Sensitivity analysis shows that the variance inverse (VI) and rank order method (ROM) considered all indices that effect ranking as compared to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP. Sensitivity analysis also proved that the proposed method is suitable to be used for RWH site selection in arid regions.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Estimation Of Mangroves In Siargao Island, Philippines Using Sentinel-1 Image
JO  - 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future
PY  - 2020
AB  - Above ground biomass (AGB) of mangroves is considered as an important ecological and habitat management indicator of various environmental conditions and processes in mangrove ecosystems. In this study, Sentinel-1 images were used to model and estimate AGB of mangroves in Del Carmen, Siargao Islands, Philippines. There were three predictor variables derived from the Sentinel -1 image used for modeling the AGB: the backscatter value from VV polarization, backscatter value from VH polarization, and the combination of the backscatter values from VV and VH polarizations. The modeling was done through linear regression between the field-measured AGB and the predictor variables, and the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were determined. Among the three predictor, the combination of the VV and VH polarizations produced a better model compared to the two predictor variables as it obtained the highest R2 of 0.43 and the lowest RMSE of 12.65 Mg/ha. Based on the developed model, a map of AGB of mangroves in the study area was generated. The generated map showed that AGB of mangroves in the study site ranges from 73.37 Mg/ha to 225.51 Mg/ha with an average of 140.2 Mg/ha. The AGB model derived in this study can be used for multi-temporal monitoring of mangroves in the study area using Sentinel-1 images. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: "Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future".

TI  - Evaluation Of Spatiotemporal Differences In Suspended Sediment Concentration Derived From Remote Sensing And Numerical Simulation For Coastal Waters
JO  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2017
AB  - Remote sensing and numerical models are often used to monitor the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in coastal waters; however, the derived SSC varies between the two methods in both space and time. In this study, a method was proposed to assess the spatiotemporal differences in SSC derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and numerical simulation for coastal waters, using the Bohai Sea in China as an example. An empirical model for SSC retrieval from remote sensed images was initially established. A comparison of the temporal synchronicity over a single day period was performed between the observed data and the numerically simulated results. The range in the SSC at different observation sites was significantly different. Both the SSC values and their daily variation ranges were larger near the estuary of the Yellow River compared with the open area due to the concurrence of tidal flow and the introduction of fresh river water with high turbidity near the estuary. The areas that exhibited spatial differences were defined according to their differences in remotely sensed and numerically simulated SSC distribution patterns. Finally, the reasons for these spatiotemporal differences were discussed. The results provided understanding into the spatiotemporal differences that were introduced when multi-source data were used, thus improving the accuracy of the results when monitoring coastal environments for the management of coastal conservation.

TI  - Simulation Tools For The Assessment Of Gnss Based Road Tolling Systems
JO  - ENC-GNSS 2008 - European Navigation Conference
PY  - 2008
AB  - It is foreseen that traditional ways of road tolling will be substituted by solutions based on positioning by means of GNSS in a few years. These new solutions are very promising because of their low cost for large infrastructures as well as their flexibility. It is clear that road tolling simulation tools constitute a powerful element for the evaluation of these emerging systems. The applicability of these simulation tools is wide, from the design and preliminary evaluation of a tolling system before being established, to the evaluation of the improvement in the tolling performances with the inclusion of Galileo. Road tolling based on GNSS implies that the position and trajectory of a vehicle is estimated by means of a GNSS system in order to decide if the vehicle must be charged and to compute the charging value. A road tolling simulation tool should be capable of computing an estimation of the charging performances based on parameters related to the quality of the GNSS navigation solution and its environment, like User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) values, Dilution of Precision (DOP) matrices, geometry and multipath in urban canyons. The assessment of the tolling system performance to be evaluated by the simulator will be represented by concepts such as the charging availability and the overcharging. In addition, the road tolling simulator would have to provide statistical analysis over the time of these figures of merit. In this way, the different quality of the navigation solution for different epochs as the GNSS constellations evolve will be considered. The possibility of modification of all the parameters involved in the road tolling system definition is a desired characteristic for developing trade-off simulations between several tolling systems. Recently, the GMV Polaris tool has been upgraded with road tolling evaluation and simulation capabilities, in line with the characteristics mentioned in the paragraph above. Polaris computes now tolling performances based on a UERE model provided as input and DOP matrices computed for each time epoch of the simulation. The tool will consider different GNSS constellations (GPS/Galileo), augmentations (SBAS, differential GPS, pseudollites, UMTS) and hybridations (odometers, gyroscopes, accelerometers⋯). Regarding the statistical analysis over the time, it allows the inclusion of satellite failure models that are very useful to obtain more realistic results. The simulation performance results are showed in graphical and textual modes for a fast evaluation of the quality of the road tolling system. With its new road tolling simulation capabilities, Polaris becomes a key tool for the design and validation of the incoming GNSS based tolling systems for technicians and decision makers.

TI  - Operational Algorithm Development And Refinement Approaches
PY  - 2003
AB  - Next-generation polar and geostationary systems, such as the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R, will deploy new generations of electro-optical reflective and emissive capabilities. These will include low-radiometric-noise, improved spatial resolution multi-spectral and hyperspectral imagers and sounders. To achieve specified performances (e.g., measurement accuracy, precision, uncertainty, and stability), and best utilize the advanced space-borne sensing capabilities, a new generation of retrieval algorithms will be implemented. In most cases, these advanced algorithms benefit from ongoing testing, and validation using heritage research mission algorithms and data (e.g., the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Shuttle Ozone Limb Scattering Experiment (SOLSE)/Limb Ozone Retrieval Experiment (LORE). In these instances, an algorithm's theoretical basis is not static, but rather improves with time. Once frozen, an operational algorithm can "lose ground" relative to research analogs. Cost/benefit analyses provide a basis for change management. The challenge is in reconciling and balancing the stability, and "comfort," that today's generation of operational platforms provide (well-characterized, known, sensors and algorithms) with the greatly improved quality, opportunities, and risks, that the next generation of operational sensors and algorithms offer. By using the best practices and lessons learned from heritage/groundbreaking activities, it is possible to implement an agile process that enables change, while managing change. This approach combines a "known-risk" frozen baseline with preset completion schedules with insertion opportunities for algorithm advances as ongoing validation activities identify and repair areas of weak performance. This paper describes an objective, adaptive implementation roadmap that takes into account the specific maturities of each system's (sensor and algorithm) technology to provide for a program that contains continuous improvement while retaining its manageability.

TI  - Automated Predictive Ecological Mapping In A Forest Region Of B.c., Canada, 2001-2005
JO  - Geoderma
PY  - 2007
AB  - Procedures for automated predictive thematic mapping were developed and applied to project areas totaling more than 3 million ha of forested land in British Columbia, Canada. The effective scale of mapping was 1:20,000 using data at a grid resolution of 25 m. The methods can be described as a form of automated feature extraction or object recognition where the objects of interest consist of ecological site types. The methods implement a hybrid of automated, semi-automated and manual procedures that develop and apply heuristic, rule-based conceptual models of ecological-landform relationships. The methods rely heavily upon terrain derivatives extracted from available digital elevation models (DEMs) in addition to satellite imagery and manually digitized maps of ancillary environmental conditions. The primary input has been the BC provincial Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) digital elevation model (DEM) surfaced to a regular grid of 25 m. Other input layers include manually interpreted maps of parent material texture, depth and ecological exception classes, manually prepared maps of the spatial distribution of ecological zones of the BC Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system and, to a limited extent, LandSat7 digital satellite imagery. The procedures do not use any field sampling to develop or train classification rules. A knowledge-based approach is used to establish classification rules which are defined and implemented using a Semantic Import (SI) Model implementation of fuzzy logic. All rules are constructed by examining and deconstructing published field guides that define the required ecological output classes and that document the current expert understanding of the conditions and criteria that control the spatial distribution of these desired output classes. An iterative, trial and error, process is used to develop, apply, evaluate and revise object recognition rules that relate ranges of values of key input data layers to an expert-assigned likelihood of occurrence for each ecological class of interest. Local expert knowledge is used at each stage to evaluate each new set of output results and to guide refinement of the fuzzy SI model classification rules. Field sample observations obtained along randomly selected closed traverses were collected following a line intercept approach and used to assess the accuracy of the final predictions of ecological classification. Application of the procedures has progressed from an initial pilot project through projects to evaluate operational scale-up to full-scale commercial application to millions of hectares. Costs have been reduced from a high of $3.50/ha to less than $0.20/ha. Rates of progress increased from 150,000 ha per person year to more than 2.0 million ha per person year. Independent assessments of map accuracy produced results superior to the highest accuracies reported for all alternatives, including traditional manual mapping methods. We conclude that we have formalized and automated many of the concepts and techniques previously used to create thematic maps of ecosystems using manual interpretation of stereo air photos and ancillary data combined with field observations. We have shown that automated feature extraction is able to capture and apply the concepts of landform control referenced by typical landform-based ecological models and classification systems. We have demonstrated that it is possible to produce accurate and cost-effective ecological-landform maps by applying fuzzy and Boolean logic and automated landform analysis procedures to widely available spatial data.

TI  - The Utility Of Earth Observation Technologies In Understanding Impacts Of Land Reform In The Eastern Region Of Zimbabwe
JO  - Journal of Land Use Science
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACT: Land tenure and land policies influence the spatial variations of land use/cover (LULC) at any given time or place. Thus, it is important to evaluate the role of land tenure policies on land cover changes. In this study, we evaluate the utility of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images in understanding the impacts of the 2000 fast track land reform (FTLR) policy on LULC in the eastern region, Zimbabwe. Landsat images for the year 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2011 were classified using traditional image classification techniques (i.e. the maximum likelihood (ML) classifier) in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Results indicate that forested areas drastically decreased by approx. 30% between the year 2000 and 2005 (during and after the FTLR), while croplands marginally increased by (approx. 30%) the results further showed that slight increase in bare lands (degraded lands) and disturbed lands. The observed LULC changes after FTLR were mostly induced by human activities resulting from changes in land tenure. Overall, the findings of this study underscores the importance of remotely sensed data in assessing the impact of FTLR on forest resources for purposes of informed and sustainable forest management. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Strategies For Early Detection - Using The Wildfire Model
JO  - WEED TECHNOLOGY
PY  - 2004
AB  - The wildfire model for invasive weed management is a simple yet effective strategic guide framed on the cornerstones of prevention, early detection, timely control, and vegetation restoration. These guidelines are the same fundamental ingredients that make up this nation's formula for effective wildfire management. Just as early detection is critical for success in fighting fires, early detection is also essential for minimizing ecological effects and to control costs asociated with new weed invasions. Both active and passive detection are important in wildfire management, and the same is true for invasive weed management. Passive weed detection-the chance discovery of new infestations by individuals pursuing other outdoor activities-can be helpful but is generally haphazard and incomplete. Passive detection alone will almost certainly fail to find many weed infestations until they have grown too large for true eradication. However, passive detection should neither be discouraged nor its value minimized because it can provide a meaningful way to inform and include additional people who otherwise would not be concerned or involved in weed management. Active weed detection consists of periodic field surveys conducted by trained individuals having clearly defined objectives and using sound search and mapping methods. Traditional methods of on-the-ground weed surveys remain important, but new technology such as remote sensing now offers additional options. Systematic field surveys and other early detection efforts are as important to successful weed management as the organized network of fire lookouts and aircraft patrols are to modern wildfire management. Any wildland invasive weed management program that does not include an effective early detection component will most likely fail.

TI  - Monitoring Of The Risk Of Farmland Abandonment As An Efficient Tool To Assess The Environmental And Socio-Economic Impact Of The Common Agriculture Policy
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2014
AB  - Farmland abandonment (FLA) could be defined as the cessation of agricultural activities on a given surface of land (Pointereau et al., 2008). FLA, often associated with social and economic problems in rural areas, has significant environmental consequences. During the 1990s, millions of hectares of farmland in the new EU Member States, from Central and Eastern Europe, were abandoned as a result of the transition process from centralized and planned to market economy. The policy tools adopted gradually within the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (EU CAP), as well as the EU environmental and structural policies, aimed to prevent further expansion of this phenomenon and to facilitate the revival of the agriculture land, being abandoned (ComReg 1122/2009). The Agri-Environment (AGRI-ENV) component of the Core Information Service (CIS), developed within the scope of the FP7-funded project "geoland2" were designed to support the agricultural user community at pan-European and national levels by contributing to the improvement of more accurate and timely monitoring of the status of agricultural land use in Europe and its change. The purpose of the product 'Farmland abandonment', as part of the AGRI-ENV package, is to detect potentially abandoned agriculture land, based on multi-annual SPOT data with several acquisitions per year. It provides essential independent information on the status of the agricultural land as recorded in the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which is one of the core instruments of the implementation of CAP. The production line is based on object-based image analysis and benefits from the extensive availability of Biophysical parameters derived from the satellite data (geoland2). The method detects/tracks those land (or so-called reference) parcels in the LPIS, holding significant amount of land agriculture found as potentially abandoned. Reference parcels with such change are flagged and reported, enabling the National Administrations to further analyze the spatial distribution and magnitude of this phenomenon at regional and national levels. Test results have been successfully generated for one test area (the Bulgarian part of the Strymunas-Struma River Basin). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Constellation Coverage Performance Analysis Based On Markov-Adc Model
JO  - Zhongguo Kongjian Kexue Jishu/Chinese Space Science and Technology
PY  - 2023
AB  - Coverage performance is the basis for communication, navigation and remote sensing constellation to provide services. It is one of the important indicators to evaluate the effectiveness or health status of constellation system. On the basis of studying the coverage performance of large constellation in low orbit, a constellation health status evaluation model based on ADC(availability, dependability, capability)was proposed. The initial status probability of constellation was calculated by using the full probability formula combining with the availability of single satellite. The constellation state transition probability was put forward considering the failure rate and repair rate of a single satellite. The constellation coverage performance system was established based on four parameters:coverage weight, revisit interval, average access number per day, and the time required for full coverage. The objective weighting method and subjective weighting method were used to give the weight values to the parameters respectively. By the way of simulation and analysis, the health status values of the constellation are obtained, which can provide a basis for the design, optimization, maintenance and other issues of the constellation. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Space Technology.

TI  - An Indicator And Min-Cost Approach For Shoreline Extraction From Satellite Imagery In Muddy Coasts
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Shoreline location plays a key role in coastal research, management, and engineering. Remote sensing enables the quantification of shoreline information with the large spatial extent and high temporal frequency. Driven by river discharge and ocean dynamics, muddy coasts exhibit complicated spatiotemporal variations. It is essential, yet challenging to extract effective shoreline features from satellite images. Taking the Yellow River Delta coast in China as the study area, we present an indicator and min-cost approach to extract the shoreline in muddy coasts. The shoreline is represented as a set of linearly connected central points with high shoreline probabilities, and a set of image and spatial indicators are developed to assess these probabilities. The Salient Value indicator integrates the gradient magnitude and the edge intensity to detect the boundary strength; the Regional Difference indicator separates the water/land class from edge intensity to measure the possibility of being water or land; and the Seaward Distance indicator spatially distinguishes the true shoreline from other spectrally similar boundaries. A cost function combines these indicators to evaluate the local shoreline possibilities. A shoreline set is produced by an improved min-cost path method to evaluate the overall shoreline possibilities. The optimal shoreline paths are selected based on the parameter analyses of the shoreline set. The performance of the approach is confirmed by comparing with the ground truth and state-of-the-art methods. The effectiveness of the approach is tested for different spatial resolution data and coastal environments. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Digitalization provides access to an integrated network of unexploited big data with potential benefits for society and the environment. The development of smart systems connected to the internet of things can generate unique opportunities to strategically address challenges associated with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure an equitable, environmentally sustainable, and healthy society. This perspective describes the opportunities that digitalization can provide towards building the sustainable society of the future. Smart technologies are envisioned as game-changing tools, whereby their integration will benefit the three essential elements of the food-water-energy nexus: (i) sustainable food production; (ii) access to clean and safe potable water; and (iii) green energy generation and usage. It then discusses the benefits of digitalization to catalyze the transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices and enhance citizens' health wellbeing by providing digital access to care, particularly for the underserved communities. Finally, the perspective englobes digitalization benefits by providing a holistic view on how it can contribute to address the serious challenges of endangered planet biodiversity and climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - 19-Year Remotely Sensed Data In The Forecast Of Spectral Models Of The Environment
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
PY  - 2021
AB  - The aims of this study were: i) to compare no-till areas in two municipalities located in different regions of Brazil, along with the influence on CO(2)Flux and GPP, and ii) to verify the difference between environmental factors followed by the trends of these variables regarding future scenarios (ARIMA time-series model number). The study was carried out in two areas with different latitudes in the municipalities of Sinop-MT and Passo Fundo-RS, both in Brazil. A time series of 19 years was performed with data acquired by remote sensing from the following satellites: i) Landsat-8 (OLI and TIRS), and ii) TERRA/AQUA (MODIS). The results propound that the spectro-temporal variables are directly influenced by soil management and agricultural practices over the observation time, with a satisfactory correlation in future predictions of the variables for the next ten years, in which presented that the variation of GPP and albedo values for the two study sites would gradually increase until 2028 and the temperature remained constant between the range of its seasonality, and CO(2)Flux tends to decrease in its seasonality, indicating a higher CO2 absorption.

TI  - National Height System Testing In Baltic Countries Using Gnss Measurements
PY  - 2017
AB  - Baltic States have changed their national height systems from Baltic Normal Height System 1977 (BHS-1977) to European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) realizations. There is a transformation formula for getting height difference theoretical value between EVRS realizations and BHS-1977. Performing practical Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements and obtained data mathematical processing, there is a possibility to calculate point height difference between GNSS data and data of 1st order levelling networks. For GNSS measurements use for height determination it is very significantly to use advanced measuring technologies and verified data processing methodology. Performed measurements have high accuracy which describes RMS errors. Average error value for axis N and E is 0.001 m, but measurement height component average error value is 0.003 m. Correct and reliable height reference system is an important part of economic planning in Baltic region while the world ocean level rises and rapid climate changes happens.

TI  - Integration Of Remote Sensing Data And Ground-Based Information To Solve Natural Resources And Environmental Problems
JO  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
PY  - 2020
AB  - We consider the rationale for the integration of remote sensing data and ground information using a statistical criterion to solve natural resources and environmental problems. The method is proposed to be implemented as the module of the "computer assistant". The algorithm that describes a set of the sequence of operations for automation of the decision-making procedure is presented. This algorithm should free the operator from a significant amount of subjective and labor-intensive work, which is performed using visual methods. Based on the proposed methodology, we perform the object recognition in aerospace images of the territory with different geological and landscape conditions and, respectively, with standard objects of different classes with different sets of values of informative features (of different nature and dimension). For the recognition and classification of images of studied objects, the probabilities of the ratios of informative features of the studied areas to ones of each standard object present in the aerospace image were determined. The results of testing the proposed methodology are presented on the examples of assessing oil and gas prospects in the areas of the Dnieper-Donetsk cavity and the problem of classifying crops of different varieties in different periods of vegetation in the agricultural fields in the Kyiv region.

TI  - Quantum Svr For Chlorophyll Concentration Estimation In Water With Remote Sensing
JO  - IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters
PY  - 2022
AB  - The increasing availability of quantum computers motivates researching their potential capabilities in enhancing the performance of data analysis algorithms. Similarly, as in other research communities, also in remote sensing (RS), it is not yet defined how its applications can benefit from the usage of quantum computing (QC). This letter proposes a formulation of the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm that can be executed by D-Wave quantum computers. Specifically, the SVR is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that is solved with quantum annealing (QA). The algorithm is tested on two different types of computing environments offered by D-Wave: the advantage system, which directly embeds the problem into the quantum processing unit (QPU), and a hybrid solver that employs both classical and QC resources. For the evaluation, we considered a biophysical variable estimation problem with RS data. The experimental results show that the proposed quantum SVR implementation can achieve comparable or, in some cases, better results than the classical implementation. This work is one of the first attempts to provide insight into how QA could be exploited and integrated in future RS workflows based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Uav Assisted Spatiotemporal Analysis And Management Of Bushfires: A Case Study Of The 2020 Victorian Bushfires
JO  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
PY  - 2021
AB  - Australia is a regular recipient of devastating bushfires that severely impacts its economy, landscape, forests, and wild animals. These bushfires must be managed to save a fortune, wildlife, and vegetation and reduce fatalities and harmful environmental impacts. The current study proposes a holistic model that uses a mixed-method approach of Geographical Information System (GIS), remote sensing, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based bushfire assessment and mitigation. The fire products of Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used for monitoring the burnt areas within the Victorian Region due to the 2020 bushfires. The results show that the aggregate of 1500 m produces the best output for estimating the burnt areas. The identified hotspots are in the eastern belt of the state that progressed north towards New South Wales. The R-2 values between 0.91-0.99 indicate the fitness of methods used in the current study. A healthy z-value index between 0.03 to 2.9 shows the statistical significance of the hotspots. Additional analysis of the 2019-20 Victorian bushfires shows a widespread radius of the fires associated with the climate change and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomenon. The UAV paths are optimized using five algorithms: greedy, intra route, inter route, tabu, and particle swarm optimization (PSO), where PSO search surpassed all the tested methods in terms of faster run time and lesser costs to manage the bushfires disasters. The average improvement demonstrated by the PSO algorithm over the greedy method is approximately 2\% and 1.2\% as compared with the intra route. Further, the cost reduction is 1.5\% compared with the inter-route scheme and 1.2\% compared with the intra route algorithm. The local disaster management authorities can instantly adopt the proposed system to assess the bushfires disasters and instigate an immediate response plan.

TI  - Direct Impacts Of Landslides On Socio-Economic Systems: A Case Study From Aranayake, Sri Lanka
JO  - Geoenvironmental Disasters
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Landslides area controversial issue worldwide and cause a wide range of impacts on the socio-economic systems of the affected community. However, empirical studies of affected environments remain inadequate for prediction and decision making. This study aims to estimate the direct impact of a massive landslide that occurred around areas with Kandyan home gardens (KHGs)in Aranayake, Sri Lanka. Results: Primary data were gathered by structured questionnaire from residents of the directly affected regions; the questionnaire data were combined with spatial data to acquire detailed information about the livelihoods and hazards at the household level. Satellite images were used to find affected land use and households prior to the landslide. Further, secondary data were obtained to assess the recovery cost. A multiple regression model was established to estimate the economic value of the home gardens. Field surveys and satellite images revealed that land-use practices during the past decades have caused environmental imbalance and have led to slope instability. Conclusions: The results reveal that 52% of household income is generated by the KHG and that the income level highly depends on the extent of the land (R 2 = 0.85, p < 0.05). The extent of destroyed land that was obtained from the satellite images and the age of the KHG were used to develop a multiple regression model to estimate the economic loss of the KHG. It was found that the landslide affected region had been generating approximately US$ 160,000 annually from their home gardens toward the GDP of the country. This study found that almost all houses in the area were at risk of further sliding, and all of them were partially or entirely affected by the landslide. Among the affected households, 60% (40 houses) had completelycollapsed, whereas 40% (27 houses) were partially damaged. Because of these circumstances, the government must provide US $ 40,369 to recover the fully and partially damaged households. Finally, a lack of awareness and unplanned garden cultivation were the main contributing factors that increased the severity of the damage. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Optimized Behavior Of Long-Term Rainfall For The Red Sea Semi-Arid Region
JO  - Advances in Nano Research
PY  - 2021
AB  - Precipitation is one of the most significant variables with an impact on the environment, agriculture, as well as the design of any hydraulic infrastructures. The rainfall analysis predicts the highest, average, and minimal values of rainfall that are expected in certain catchments for return periods. The long-term variability of rainfall over the Arbaat watershed was studied at the various stations in a duration (day, month, and year) from 1942 to 2010 rainfall runoff using the Isohyetal Map of the area besides using different plotting position formulae of rainfall ratios. This statistical analysis will offer valuable data for water resource planners for Port Sudan, farmers, and Red Sea Water Corporations engineers (RSSWC) to evaluate the availability of water and create the storage accordingly. From the rainfall-depth analysis outcomes, the rainfall pattern was found to be irregular. Although the historical data was used, the meteorological observation of Suakin, Sinkat, and Arbaat stations was stopped from work. However, Port Sudan station gave reliable results without resorting to precipitation data measured by the satellites. Besides, the outcomes of this study can provide rational guidelines and policy concerning water resources to preserve the health of several ecosystems in the regions of under study. © 2021 Techno-Press, Ltd.

TI  - The Impact Of Geography On Energy Infrastructure Costs
JO  - Energy Policy
PY  - 2009
AB  - Infrastructure planning for networked infrastructure such as grid electrification (or piped supply of water) has historically been a process of outward network expansion, either by utilities in response to immediate economic opportunity, or in response to a government mandate or subsidy intended to catalyze economic growth. While significant progress has been made in access to grid electricity in Asia, where population densities are greater and rural areas tend to have nucleated settlements, access to grid electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low; a problem generally ascribed to differences in settlement patterns. The discussion, however, has remained qualitative, and hence it has been difficult for planners to understand the differing costs of carrying out grid expansion in one region as opposed to another. This paper describes a methodology to estimate the cost of local-level distribution systems for a least-cost network, and to compute additional information of interest to policymakers, such as the marginal cost of connecting additional households to a grid as a function of the penetration rate. We present several large datasets of household locations developed from satellite imagery, and examine them with our methodology, providing insight into the relationship between settlement pattern and the cost of rural electrification. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Dynamics Of Human-Induced Lakes And Their Impact On Land Surface Temperature In Toshka Depression, Western Desert, Egypt
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) give rise to several environmental problems which modify the microclimate of a region. Therefore, land surface temperature (LST) is a significant environmental variable that is appreciably influenced by LULC changes. The main aim of this research was to quantify the impacts of LULC changes from the drying of Toshka Lakes on LST by remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Landsat series Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images were used to estimate LST from 2001 to 2019. Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) was applied to the mosaicked Landsat images to extract water bodies from the research area. Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) was utilized to predict the reclaimed land in the Toshka region until 2019. The kappa coefficient had been involved in this research to assess the accuracy of water extraction. The results indicated a decrease in the lakes by about 1517.79 km(2) with an average increase in LST by about 25.02 degrees C from 2001 to 2019. It was observed that the dried areas of the lakes were converted to bare soil and are covered by salt crusts. The results indicated that the land-use change was a significant driver for the increased LST. The mean annual LST increased considerably by 0.6 degrees C/year from 2009 to 2019. A strong negative correlation between LST and Toshka Lakes area (R-square = 0.98) estimated from regression analysis implied that Toshka Lakes drying considerably affected the microclimate of the study area. Severe drought conditions, soil degradation, and many environmental issues were predicted due to the rise of LST in the research area. The findings of this research focus on the benefits of satellite data for assessing human-induced changes and their impacts on microclimate. There is an urgent need to develop favorable strategies for sustainable environmental management in the Toshka region.

TI  - The Relative Value Of Facebook Advertising Data For Poverty Mapping
JO  - Proceedings of the 14th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, ICWSM 2020
PY  - 2020
AB  - Having reliable and up-to-date poverty data is a prerequisite for monitoring the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for planning effective poverty reduction interventions. Unfortunately, traditional data sources are often outdated or lacking appropriate disaggregation. As a remedy, satellite imagery has recently become prominent in obtaining geographically-fine-grained and up-to-date poverty estimates. Satellite data can pick up signals of economic activity by detecting light at night, it can pick up development status by detecting infrastructure such as roads, and it can pick up signals for individual household wealth by detecting different building footprints and roof types. It can, however, not look inside the households and pick up signals from individuals. On the other hand, alternative data sources such as audience estimates from Facebook's advertising platform provide insights into the devices and internet connection types used by individuals in different locations. Previous work has shown the value of such anonymous, publicly-accessible advertising data from Facebook for studying migration, gender gaps, crime rates, and health, among others. In this work, we evaluate the added value of using Facebook data over satellite data for mapping socioeconomic development in two low and middle income countries - the Philippines and India. We show that Facebook features perform roughly similar to satellite data in the Philippines with value added for urban locations. In India, however, where Facebook penetration is lower, satellite data perform better. Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

TI  - Exploring The Spatial Patterns Of Vegetation Fragmentation Using Local Spatial Autocorrelation Indices
JO  - Journal of Applied Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of urban vegetation obtained from discrete land cover classes is sensitive to classification errors and can result in a substantial loss of information, due to the degradation of continuous quantitative information. Although there is an increasing ecological need to use continuous methods to understand spatial heterogeneity and vegetation fragmentation, they remain unexplored. Since local indicators of spatial association (LISA) can capture important spatial patterns of clustering and dispersion at a local scale, it can capture important ecological patterns and process of vegetation fragmentation. This work examines the utility of LISA which allows exploration of local patterns in spatial data in identifying high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) spatial clusters of vegetation patches and fragmentation patterns in Harare metropolitan city in Zimbabwe. The LISA indices of Getis-Ord Gi∗ and local Moran's I are computed both on continuous normalized difference vegetation index and discrete land cover data of vegetation and nonvegetation of Sentinel 2016 and 2018. Local spatial clustering patterns are identified with Z-score values that indicate the significance of each statistic. High positive Z-scores are located in the large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation. Negative Z-scores are located in more dispersed and highly fragmented vegetation. The results suggest that there is a strong tendency for large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation patches to be spatially clustered and for small, isolated and sparse vegetation patches to be dispersed. The highly fragmented vegetation patches are located in the heavily urbanized part of the city. Overall, findings of this study underscore the relevance of the spatially explicit method of LISA as a valuable source of spatial information for the assessment of local spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. This can be used to develop policies that support effective conservation and restoration strategies. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration Based On The Satellite-Retrieved Near-Infrared Reflectance Of Vegetation (Nirv) Over Croplands
JO  - GIScience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accurate information on cropland evapotranspiration (ET) can facilitate effective agricultural management. However, the application of existing physical models over broad regions may be impeded due to the need for difficult to acquire information about environmental factors that constrain ET. The recently developed near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), which can reasonably characterize ecosystem photosynthesis without the need for additional environmental information, is potentially useful for estimating cropland ET and reducing the difficulty in ET modeling. As such, we proposed two simply formulated semi-empirical models that utilize NIRv as a major factor constraining cropland ET. The first model, termed Penman–Monteith+ (PM+), computed canopy transpiration using the PM equation along with canopy conductance values estimated from NIRv-derived gross primary productivity (NIRv-GPP) and calculated soil evaporation using an empirical approach. Another model, termed underlying water-use efficiency+ (uWUE+), used the uWUE approach along with the NIRv-GPP to predict ET. We calibrated and validated PM+ and uWUE+ over 32 cropland flux sites and then compared them with six complex models. The better model between PM+ and uWUE+ was applied to estimate regional ET over North China Plain (NCP), where typical C3 and C4 crops were planted during 2010–2018, along with remote sensing and meteorological data. Results indicated that the two new models can reasonably estimate cropland ET. The PM+ model reproduced an eight-day value of ET (denoted as eight-day ET) with R2 = 0.741 and RMSE = 5.638 mm/8d, slightly better than the uWUE+ model (R2 = 0. 674 and RMSE = 6.275 mm/8d) for a cross-site validation over 17 flux sites of the validation dataset. Site-level validation revealed consistently better performance of PM+ compared to uWUE+ over most flux sites. For the comparisons with six existing models, PM+ can perform better than all these models and uWUE+ is better than five of them. Subsequently, the PM+ (uWUE+) model reasonably reproduced eight-day ET over four sites under a dry climate (Arid Index ≤ 0.5) with site-level R2 = 0.691 (0.617) and RMSE = 6.663 (7.906) mm/8d on average, which is better than the six existing models. In addition, the regional mean annual ET varied from 590 mm per year (mm/yr) to 680 mm/yr over NCP with a significant increasing trend of 9.05 mm/yr (p < 0.01), and the ET values in maize growing season were higher than that in wheat growing season. Our results demonstrated that the simply formulated PM+ and uWUE+ models can provide simple and robust approaches to estimate regional and global cropland ET. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Modeling Rainfall-Runoff Estimation And Assessing Water Harvesting Zone For Irrigation Practices In Keleta Watershed, Awash River Basin, Ethiopia
JO  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
PY  - 2023
AB  - The world's water demand is increasing twice as quickly as the world's population. Contrarily, the greatest problem facing humanity in the twenty-first century is the supply of food. During dry seasons, when water collecting is a crucial survival strategy, the communities in the study area experience water deficit for agricultural production. In this study, socioeconomic and biophysical parameters were considered to evaluate the water harvesting zone for irrigation practices. With the aid of this technology, water harvesting sites can be found in acceptable sites, and water resource management can be improved to address water shortages during the dry season when crops are at key stages of growth and filling. The integrated geographical information system/Remote Sensing (GIS/RS), Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), fuzzy logic, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model were used to carry this out. Rainfall, drainage density, surface runoff, percentage of clay content, land use land cover, slope, lithology, lineament, and Euclidian distance to settlement and road were the criteria utilized to choose the Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) sites. The run-off was estimated using the SWAT model, weights for each influential component were determined using AHP, the input factor was standardized using fuzzy membership, and factors were combined using gamma fuzzy (ℽ= 0.9) overlay weighting. The model's statistical performance was demonstrated by R2 values of 0.79 and NSE values of 0.77 for monthly calibration periods and R2 values of 0.81 and NSE values of 0.75 for monthly validation periods. The study area's Rainwater Harvesting potential suitability classes covered very highly suitable (16.91\%), extremely suitable (27.6\%), moderately suitable (20.23\%), low suitable (13.1\%), and not suitable (6.43\%), and restrictions (15.73\%). The study's findings could help decision-makers identify more lucrative and long-lasting irrigation investment options in the Keleta watershed and make better decisions regarding the development of irrigation projects there.

AB  - Manesar Nala watershed, having an aerial extent of 71.53 km(2), was subjected to modelling of its hydrological behaviour for assessing its water resource potential. Modern tools and techniques of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used for assessment of runoff generating potential using the Hydrologic Soil Cover Complex (HSCC) Method {[}U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Soil Conservation System-Curve Number (SCS-CN) approach]. RS and GIS were used in generation and integration of thematic maps {[}such as Land use/Land cover (using LISS-III data) and Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG), (using soil map of study area) to derive the Curve Number (CN) for simulating Runoff (R-o)]. The daily rainfall (P) data for the study period 2002-2015 were acquired from NOAA Climate Prediction Center (NCPC). Corresponding R-o from the watershed for intense storm events for 14 years were calculated through RS and GIS. GIS and SCS-CN model was employed for modelling the runoff production to study its hydrological behaviour. The study showed that the Manesar Nala watershed was having a composite Curve Number - II (CNII) value of 82.5 for normal conditions. For dry and wet conditions these values were estimated at 66.44 (CNI) and 91.56 (CNIII), respectively. This investigation showed that Manesar Nala watershed exhibited an annual average (of 14 years, 2002-2015) R-o volume of 4 542 514.37 m(3) based on the average annual rainfall (P) of 0.72 m (720 mm). The average annual surface runoff (R-o) was predicted to be approximately 0.21 m with annual runoff coefficient (C-R) of 0.29. During the study, we also found a strong correlation 'r' between satellite driven P and R-o from NRCS-CN method of the order of 0.94. The methodology so developed has the potential to be used in other similar ungauged watersheds in the same agro-climatic conditions for the purpose of planning of watershed conservation measures and other developmental activities.

TI  - Large-Scale Construction For A Space-Based Economy
JO  - Space 2002 and Robotics 2002
PY  - 2002
AB  - The paper articulates the need for a coherent plan for a Space-Based economy. Such a plan would allow all segments of industry and the public to participate as stakeholders rather than as spectators. The architecture as laid out provides the argument to synergize efforts directed at the Moon, NEO, Mars and the Asteroids, and identifies the engineering roles of the construction, mining and transportation industries in enabling such an economy. Long-term human habitation beyond Earth requires radiation shielding. This requirement drives the design of orbital habitats, which are an essential component of a Space-based economy. Past attempts to design such habitats have been hindered by the lack of suitable construction means for such high-mass, large structures. This problem is revisited in the light of advances in lunar power production, metal extraction, robotic manufacturing, solar-heated propulsion for orbit transfer vehicles, and telepresence. It is shown that the construction of a 1km-radius cylindrical radiation shield is both feasible and cost-effective when done as part of a coherent plan for a Space-based economy. The architecture presents a scheme for bootstrapping resources on the Moon to provide power, metal extraction, and an electromagnetic mass driver, followed by a process for automated construction of the massive radiation shield and essential internal structure. Methods for costing and financing such a project are considered. It is seen that when set in the context of a coherent plan for a Space-based economy, the level of public investment comes down to levels of present public infrastructure and environmental projects. In addition, risk assessments for each of the component entities shows that risk is brought down to levels which can appeal to investors.

TI  - Development Of A Solar Irradiance Dataset For Oahu, Hawai'i
JO  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
PY  - 2018
AB  - Solar power as an alternative energy source in Hawai'i has grown in recent years {[}1], with increasing amounts of photovoltaic panels found statewide. Power resource management and grid stability require that the variability in irradiance, hence, solar power coming into the electric grid be understood. The aim of this study is to produce an irradiance dataset for Oahu, Hawai'i, containing temporal and spatial variability, so it can be used in modeling power generation. Images from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite are used to estimate surface irradiance within the Heliosat method and are validated against ground-based pyranometer measurements. The diurnal cycle was then removed to assess the accuracy of the Heliosat method in estimating atmospheric attenuation. Lastly, the irradiance data was converted into DC power to consider the dataset in terms of power generation. The irradiance dataset produced has RMSE values of 15-30\% depending on location, with correction for viewing angle discrepancies found to improve the performance. Variability on sub hourly, diurnal, monthly and yearly time scales are found within the dataset, as well as events such as an El Nino year, a La Nina year and Kona lows, together with a spatial distribution consistent with previous research.

TI  - Design And Simulation In Sar Satellites' Task Planning System Using Genetic Algorithm With Entropy Operator
JO  - AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to innovatively propose to improve the efficiency of satellite observation and avoid the waste of satellite resources, a genetic algorithm with entropy operator (GAE) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites' task planning algorithm. Design/methodology/approach - The GAE abbreviated as GAE introduces the entropy value of each orbit task into the fitness calculation of the genetic algorithm, which makes the orbit with higher entropy value more likely to be selected and participate in the remaining process of the genetic algorithm. Findings - The simulation result shows that in a condition of the same calculate ability, 85\% of the orbital revisit time is unchanged or decreased and 30\% is significantly reduced by using the GAE compared with traditional task planning genetic algorithm, which indicates that the GAE can improve the efficiency of satellites' task planning. Originality/value - The GAE is an optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. It combines entropy in thermodynamics with task planning problems. The algorithm considers the whole lifecycle of task planning and gets the desired results. It can greatly improve the efficiency of task planning in observation satellites and shorten the entire task execution time. Then, using the GAE to complete SAR satellites' task planning is of great significance in reducing satellite operating costs and emergency rescue, which brings certain economic and social benefits.

TI  - Global Burden Of 369 Diseases And Injuries In 204 Countries And Territories, 1990–2019: A Systematic Analysis For The Global Burden Of Disease Study 2019
JO  - The Lancet
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries. Methods: GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. Findings: Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. Interpretation: As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and developm nt investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

TI  - Baseline Surface Radiation Network (Bsrn/Wcrp): New Precision Radiometry For Climate Research
JO  - Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society
PY  - 1998
AB  - To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radiometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN, consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S, and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to scientific communities in various ways depending on the communication environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base, organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future tasks to be accomplished.

TI  - Fallowing Temporal Patterns Assessment In Rainfed Agricultural Areas Based On Ndvi Time Series Autocorrelation Values
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fallowing is a common practice in Mediterranean areas where water scarcity becomes a limiting factor, affecting soil productivity, crop yield and biodiversity. In mainland Spain, fallow lands expand across three million hectares every year, constituting around 30\% of rainfed arable lands and 6\% of the national surface. There is a need of monitoring fallow lands to better map land use intensity and therefore achieve a sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture. However, most of current land use classification systems do not include lands under fallowing practices as a specific class. In this research, a new and highly operative methodology based on NDVI time series autocorrelation values to assess fallowing temporal patterns across rainfed agricultural areas is proposed. This approach was tested in mainland Spain, using the autocorrelation function of MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2012 at 250 m spatial resolution. The field observational database from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was used for validation purposes. The dataset used includes 338 pixels with annual information about the cultivated and fallowed surface within the entire study period. It was demonstrated that specific autocorrelation values at lags corresponding to one, two, and three years contained relevant information to identify lands under fallowing practices and assess their temporal pattern. Integrating autocorrelation variables in a random forest model made it possible to improve the assessment. The classification results were in agreement with the field dataset with an overall accuracy higher than 80\%. Results revealed that approximately half of rainfed agricultural areas were regularly cultivated and distributed mainly in the northwestern Spain. The other half mainly located across northeast, center and south of Spain, showed crop-fallow rotation patterns. This methodology is a promising technique to map land management intensity using the entire time series in a highly operative manner. It is expected that in the near future the availability of remote sensing time series with better spatial resolution will make it possible to improve the assessment of agricultural intensification.

TI  - Social Disparities In Tree Canopy And Park Accessibility: A Case Study Of Six Cities In Illinois Using Gis And Remote Sensing
JO  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
PY  - 2013
AB  - Easy access to green space and the presence of lush tree canopy in neighborhoods provide substantial psychophysical benefits to residents. However, these urban amenities are often unevenly distributed between white and racial/ethnic minority residents. In this study, we investigated racial/ethnic disparities in access to parks and tree canopy using a geographic information system (GIS) and remote-sensing techniques in six Illinois cities. An accessibility index based on a new Google Maps application programming interface (API) was used to calculate walking distances between points of origins and parks, and integrated classification techniques were applied to calculate the amount of tree canopy. Kernel-smoothing function was applied to both canopy and park layers to transform point value to continuous surface value. Both ordinary regression and spatial regression were used to find the relationship.The results of this study show that racial/ethnic minorities have less tree canopy in their neighborhoods, but it did not find significant differences in terms of access to parks. Spatial regression was determined to be an effective modeling approach for the data used in this study. Methods used in this study can be extended to study accessibility to various destinations using different means of transit, and the results can guide intervention programs to help reduce environmental inequity. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Epidemio: Earth Observation In Epidemiology
JO  - European Space Agency, (Special Publication) ESA SP
PY  - 2005
AB  - The objective of the EPIDEMIC project is to provide earth-observation- derived information on the environment to epidemiologists working to study, monitor and predict threats to human health. End-user organizations directly involved in the project include the World Health Organization, European research institutes, and several organizations based in Africa. Earth observation provides a broad range of information types: digital elevation maps, urban maps, cartography, maps of water bodies, vegetation maps, land surface temperature maps, and monitoring of wind-blown Sahelian dust. This information is used in applications such as malaria and meningococcal meningitis epidemic early warning, in planning fieldwork campaigns for research into the Ebola virus's reservoir, and in the management of development projects in public health. This paper describes the work done in the DUE EPIDEMIC project and the potential benefits that earth observation can bring to the epidemiological research.

TI  - An Approach For Gis-Based Statistical Landslide Susceptibility Zonation - With A Case Study In The Himalayas
JO  - LANDSLIDES
PY  - 2005
AB  - Landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) is necessary for disaster management and planning development activities in mountainous regions. A number of methods, viz. landslide distribution, qualitative, statistical and distribution-free analyses have been used for the LSZ studies and they are again briefly reviewed here. In this work, two methods, the Information Value (InfoVal) and the Landslide Nominal Susceptibility Factor (LNSF) methods that are based on bivariate statistical analysis have been applied for LSZ mapping in a part of the Himalayas. Relevant thematic maps representing various factors (e.g., slope, aspect, relative relief, lithology, buffer zones along thrusts, faults and lineaments, drainage density and landcover) that are related to landslide activity, have been generated using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The LSZ derived from the LNSF method, has been compared with that produced from the InfoVal method and the result shows a more realistic LSZ map from the LNSF method which appears to conform to the heterogeneity of the terrain.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Salt Marsh Vegetation For Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve, Shanghai
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2007
AB  - Salt marsh vegetation is one of the most important components of coastal wetlands, and its evolution and dynamics have direct influences on the ecosystem service and value of wetlands. Based on analyses and interpretation of four Landsat TM remotely sensed images, integrated with historical data and field surveys, this study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of salt marshes at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve for the period 1998-2005. The results showed that the total area of salt marsh increased from 2478.32 hm2 in 1998 to 4687.74 hm2 in 2005 along with the expansion and accretion of tidal flats in the natural reserve. Results also indicated that Spartina alterniflora expanded at a much faster rate than the native species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis. In less than 10 years, the area of S. alterniflora increased from the initial introduction to 1283.4 hm2 by 2005 and it had formed a large area of mono-dominant community. During this same period, the area of the P. australis community decreased significantly, mainly due to the influences of wetland reclamations in 1998 and 2001, and the invasion of S. alterniflora. S. alterniflora expanded very quickly in the nature reserve due to its stronger competitive capacity and wider ecological niche, and the rapid accretion of intertidal flats which provided more suitable habitat. It can be concluded that the range expansion of exotic S. altemiflora poses a potential threat to local ecosystems, and measures should be taken for the management and control of this invasive species at the nature reserve.

TI  - Economic Valuation Of Mangroves In The Niger Delta: An Interdisciplinary Approach
JO  - World Fisheries: A Social-Ecological Analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Today, the concept of an interdisciplinary approach to research has gained tremendous attention, both because it is an antithesis to the conventional divisions of knowledge-based research, and because complex problems in applied research almost always span various disciplines. This study explores one interdisciplinary approach to research, which addresses the problem of equitable mangrove valuation for the sustainable management of the resource in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. By integrating results from satellite remote sensing analysis and socioeconomic surveys, the economic value of mangroves in the Niger Delta, discounted over a 30- year period at 20% discount rate, ranges from $640-2,825ha. The variation in economic value is attributed to the variation in the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities that participated in the study. © 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Characterisation Of Landscape Pattern For Environmental Assessment. A Gis Approach Based On Remotely Sensed Data
PY  - 1997
AB  - The land cover map of an area in Northern Italy is obtained by integrating remotely sensed data (Landsat TM and scanned aerial photographs) with various topographic information using GIS technology. The patterns of the resulting nine land cover classes are studied with two classic indices of common use in landscape pattern analysis: the fractal dimension and the diversity index. In the analysis, the patterns are considered under the influence of different gradients of human influence, elevation and aspect. The combination of fractal dimension and diversity values is used to generate graphs of trajectories along the mentioned gradients for each of the land cover classes. The results suggest that the combination of fractal dimension and diversity indices is an efficient tool to characterise landscape pattern response to natural influence and /or human disturbance. For any situation of the landscape, these trajectories can be used to evaluate and compare pattering of different scenarios, real or simulated, in planning studies.

TI  - Insights Into The Environmental Conditions Contributing To Variability In The Larval Recruitment Of The Tropical Sardine<I> Sardinella</I><I> Lemuru</I>
JO  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
PY  - 2021
AB  - The small pelagic fishery in the southern Philippines is one of the largest contributors to fisheries production in the country, and is dominated by the Bali sardine Sardinella lemuru. This species is a year-round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the northeast monsoon (NEM) months of November to February. However, there is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species' survival during its early life history stages. Here, we attempt to discern the importance of temperature, prey density and advection on sardine larvae. The larvae were represented as passive particles that were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal. The conditions the larvae experienced, namely, temperature and estimated prey density based on satellite chlorophyll-a values were recorded at each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days. The temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed that sardines spawned during the NEM months experienced higher chlorophyll-a, lower (more optimal) sea surface temperature, albeit higher advective loss, than sardines spawned during other months. Comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch years, sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher retention nearshore. Our results emphasize that sardine stock management efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently in catches.

TI  - Rapid Urban Growth, Land-Use Changes And Air Pollution In Santiago, Chile
JO  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 1999
AB  - This paper is a contribution to the understanding of the topoclimatic and environmental geography of the basin where Santiago - one of the most polluted Latin American city - is located. In the first part, land-use change is analysed looking at the climatic transformation caused by the rapid transit from natural semiarid surface to urban areas. In the second part, seasonal weather and daily cycles of slope winds and the available ventilation are described trying to relate those patterns with the spatial distribution of air pollution. A combination of meteorological, geographical and cultural factors explain extreme air pollution events: meteorologically, Santiago is under permanent subsidence inversion layers. Geographically, the city is located in a closed basin surrounded by mountains. Culturally, the urban area has the highest population concentration (40\% of the national total), industries (near 70\% of the total) and vehicles, which are the main sources of smog. The urban and suburban transport system is based on a large number of buses (diesel) and private cars, both experiencing a rapid growth from the past few years. The city and specially the transport system generates high emissions of pollutant, bur the natural semiarid deforested soils and slopes are also important sources. The local wind system can explain the differential spatial distribution on the concentration of air pollutants in the city and its periphery. In winter train season concentrations of particulate matter are higher at the centre and the SW part of the city. The andean piedmont area (E part of the city) shows minimum values, suggesting major ventilation effects of slope and valley winds. Ozone exceeds air quality standards in summer (dry season) at all sites in the centre and periphery. However, the O-3-concentrations are higher on preferred residential areas located at the piedmont area (E part of the city), suggesting air pollution transport effects. Currently, there is no consideration of these local climatic features in the process of urban planning. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Scientific directorate of the European Space Agency provides the scientific community a gateway to space by its large number of space missions. Several satellites are continuously developed with diverse scientific and mission objectives. Encouraging reuse and commonality among spacecrafts has been a target, with ambitions of reducing cost and development time, for about a decade. So far reuse and commonality has been achieved among spacecrafts, which shares objectives, or by reusing a platform and shaping it for the next mission. Within Attitude Control and Measurement Subsystems (ACMS) commonality has mainly been reached for satellites sharing orbit, stabilisation technique and pointing requirements. This article will describe a new direction within commonality development. It will describe the achievement of a common ACMS subsystem for a fixed observatory, a spin stabilised spacecraft and an agile moving observatory. The article including requirements definitions, design tradeoffs, assembly integration and verification approach concluding with the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.

TI  - Detecting Tropical Peatland Degradation: Combining Remote Sensing And Organic Geochemistry
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Tropical peatlands are important carbon stores that are vulnerable to drainage and conversion to agriculture. Protection and restoration of peatlands are increasingly recognised as key nature based solutions that can be implemented as part of climate change mitigation. Identification of peatland areas that are important for protection and restauration with regards to the state of their carbon stocks, are therefore vital for policy makers. In this paper we combined organic geochemical analysis by Rock-Eval (6) pyrolysis of peat collected from sites with different land management history and optical remote sensing products to assess if remotely sensed data could be used to predict peat conditions and carbon storage. The study used the North Selangor Peat Swamp forest, Malaysia, as the model system. Across the sampling sites the carbon stocks in the below ground peat was ca 12 times higher than the forest (median carbon stock held in ground vegetation 114.70 Mg ha-1 and peat soil 1401.51 Mg ha-1). Peat core sub-samples and litter collected from Fire Affected, Disturbed Forest, and Managed Recovery locations (i.e. disturbed sites) had different decomposition profiles than Central Forest sites. The Rock-Eval pyrolysis of the upper peat profiles showed that surface peat layers at Fire Affected, Disturbed Forest, and Managed Recovery locations had lower immature organic matter index (I-index) values (average I-index range in upper section 0.15 to -0.06) and higher refractory organic matter index (R -index) (average R-index range in upper section 0.51 to 0.65) compared to Central Forest sites indicating enhanced decomposition of the surface peat. In the top 50 cm section of the peat profile, carbon stocks were negatively related to the normalised burns ratio (NBR) (a satellite derived parameter) (Spearman's rho = -0.664, S = 366, p-value = <0.05) while there was a positive relationship between the hydrogen index and the normalised burns ratio profile (Spearman's rho = 0.7, S = 66, p-value = <0.05) suggesting that this remotely sensed product is able to detect degradation of peat in the upper peat profile. We conclude that the NBR can be used to identify degraded peatland areas and to support identification of areas for conversation and restoration. Copyright: © 2023 Brown et al.

TI  - Seasonality Of Vegetation Types Of South America Depicted By Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) Time Series
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2018
AB  - The development, implementation and enforcement of policies involving the rational use of the land and the conservation of natural resources depend on an adequate characterization and understanding of the land cover, including its dynamics. This paper presents an approach for monitoring vegetation dynamics using high-quality time series of MODIS surface reflectance data by generating fraction images using Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) over South America continent. The approach uses physically-based fraction images, which highlight target information and reduce data dimensionality. Further dimensionality was also reduced by using the vegetation fraction images as input to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The RGB composite of the first three PCA components, accounting for 92.9\% of the dataset variability, showed good agreement with the main ecological regions of South America continent. The analysis of 21 temporal profiles of vegetation fraction values and precipitation data over South America showed the ability of vegetation fractions to represent phenological cycles over a variety of environments. Comparisons between vegetation fractions and precipitation data indicated the close relationship between water availability and leaf mass/chlorophyll content for several vegetation types. In addition, phenological changes and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic pressure were identified, particularly those associated with agricultural practices and forest removal. Therefore the proposed method supports the management of natural and non-natural ecosystems, and can contribute to the understanding of key conservation issues in South America, including deforestation, disturbance and fire occurrence and management.

TI  - Mapping Beach Morphodynamics Remotely: A Novel Application Tested On South African Sandy Shores
JO  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
PY  - 2011
AB  - Sandy beaches have been identified as threatened ecosystems but despite the need to conserve them, they have been generally overlooked. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) has emerged as an efficient method of selecting areas for conservation priority. However, SCP analyses require digital shapefiles of habitat and species diversity. Mapping these attributes for beaches from field data can take years and requires exhaustive resources. This study thus sought to derive a methodology to classify and map beach morphodynamic types from satellite imagery. Since beach morphodynamics is a strong predictor of macrofauna diversity, they could be considered a good surrogate for mapping beach biodiversity. A dataset was generated for 45 microtidal beaches (of known morphodynamic type) by measuring or coding for several physical characteristics from imagery acquired from Google Earth. Conditional inference trees revealed beach width to be the only factor that significantly predicted beach morphodynamic type, giving four categories: dissipative, dissipative-intermediate, intermediate and reflective. The derived model was tested by using it to predict the morphodynamic type of 28 other beaches of known classification. Model performance was good (75\% prediction accuracy) but misclassifications occurred at the three breaks between the four categories. For beaches around these breaks, consideration of surf zone characteristics in addition to beach width ameliorated the misclassifications. The final methodology yielded a 93\% prediction accuracy of beach morphodynamic type. Overlaying other considerations on this classification scheme could provide additional value to the layer, such that it also describes species' spatial patterns. These could include: biogeographic regions, estuarine versus sandy beaches and short versus long beaches. The classification scheme was applied to the South African shoreline as a case study. The distribution of the beach morphodynamic types was partly influenced by geography. Most of the long, dissipative beaches are found along the west coast of the country, the south coast beaches are mostly dissipative-intermediate, and the east coast beaches range from short, estuarine pocket and embayed beaches in the former Transkei (south east), to longer intermediate and reflective beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (in the north east). Once combined with the three biogeographic regions, and distinguishing between estuarine and sandy shores, the South African coast comprised 24 different beach types. Representing shorelines in this form opens up potential for numerous spatial analyses that can not only further our understanding of sandy beach ecology at large spatial scales but also aid in deriving conservation strategies for this threatened ecosystem.

TI  - Application Of Database Approaches To The Study Of Earth's Aeolian Environments: Community Needs And Goals
JO  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aeolian science is faced with significant challenges that impact its ability to benefit from recent advances in information technology. The discipline deals with high-end systems in the form of ground and satellite based sensors, computer modeling and simulation, and wind tunnel experiments. Aeolian scientists also collect field data manually with observational methods that may differ significantly between studies with little agreement on even basic morphometric parameters and terminology. Data produced from these studies, while forming the core of research papers and reports, is rarely available to the community at large. Recent advances are also superimposed on an underlying semantic structure that dates to the 1800's or earlier that is confusing, with ambiguously defined, and at times even contradictory, meanings. The aeolian "world-view" does not always fit within neat increments nor is defined by crisp objects. Instead change is continuous and features are fuzzy. Development of an ontological framework to guide spatiotemporal research is the fundamental starting point for organizing data in aeolian science. This requires a "rethinking" of how we define, collect, process, store and share data along with the development of a community-wide collaborative approach designed to bring the discipline into a data rich future. There is also a pressing need to develop efficient methods to integrate, analyze and manage spatial and temporal data and to promote data produced by aeolian scientists so it is available for preparing diagnostic studies, as input into a range of environmental models, and for advising national and international bodies that drive research agendas. This requires the establishment of working groups within the discipline to deal with content, format, processing pipelines, knowledge discovery tools and database access issues unique to aeolian science. Achieving this goal requires the development of comprehensive and highly-organized databases, tools that allow aeolian scientists as well as those in related disciplines to access and analyze the wealth of data available, and a supporting infrastructure and community-wide effort that allows aeolian scientists to communicate their results in replicable ways to scientists and decision and policy makers. Fortunately, much of the groundwork required to move aeolian science into a data rich future has been developed in other data rich physical science fields, and within the computer science and information technology disciplines.

TI  - Progress In Achieving Airborne Oil Slick Thickness Measurement
JO  - Environment Canada Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program Technical Seminar (AMOP) Proceedings
PY  - 2000
AB  - A joint project between Environment Canada, the US Minerals Management Service, Imperial Oil Resources Ltd, and the Industrial Materials Institute of the National Research Council of Canada developed a prototype slick thickness measurement system, known as the Laser Ultrasonic Remote Sensing of Oil Thickness (LURSOT) sensor. This laboratory sensor was the initial step in the ultimate goal of providing an airborne sensor with the ability to remotely measure oil thickness on water. The LURSOT sensor employs three lasers to produce and measure the time-of-flight of ultrasonic waves in oil and hence provide a direct measurement of oil slick thickness. The successful application of this technology to the measurement of oil slick thickness will benefit the scientific community as a whole by providing information about the dynamics of oil slick spreading and the spill responder by providing a measurement of the effectiveness of spill countermeasures such as dispersant application. Initial results from laboratory testing prior to a second round of airborne test flights of the modified LURSOT system are presented. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 23rd Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, AMOP Technical Seminar (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 6/14-16/2000).

TI  - On-Road, In-Use Gaseous Emission Measurements By Remote Sensing Of School Buses Equipped With Diesel Oxidation Catalysts And Diesel Particulate Filters
JO  - Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association
PY  - 2009
AB  - A remote sensing device was used to obtain on-road and in-use gaseous emission measurements from three fleets of schools buses at two locations in Washington State. This paper reports each fleet's carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) mean data. The fleets represent current emission retrofit technologies, such as diesel particulate filters and diesel oxidation catalysts, and a control fleet. This study shows that CO and HC emissions decrease with the use of either retrofit technology when compared with control buses of the same initial emission standards. The CO and HC emission reductions are consistent with published U.S. Environmental Protection Agency verified values. The total oxides of nitrogen (NOx), NO, and the NO2/NOx ratio all increase with each retrofit technology when compared with control buses. As was expected, the diesel particulate filters emitted significantly higher levels of NO2 than the control fleet because of the intentional conversion of NO to NO2 by these systems. Most prior research suggests that NOx emissions are unaffected by the retrofits; however, these previous studies have not included measurements from retrofit devices on-road and after nearly 5 yr of use. Two 2006 model-year buses were also measured. These vehicles did not have retrofit devices but were built to more stringent new engine standards. Reductions in HCs and NOx were observed for these 2006 vehicles in comparison to other non-retrofit earlier model-year vehicles. Copyright 2009 Air & Waste Management Association.

TI  - Epidemiology Of Escherichia Coli Bacteraemia In England: Results Of An Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance Programme
JO  - Journal of Hospital Infection
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background Escherichia coli causes more than one-third of the bacteraemia cases in England each year, and the incidence of these infections is increasing. Aim To determine the underlying risk factors associated with E. coli bacteraemia. Methods A three-month enhanced sentinel surveillance study involving 35 National Health Service hospitals was undertaken in the winter of 2012/13 to collect risk factor information and further details on the underlying source of infection to augment data already collected by the English national surveillance programme. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for E. coli isolated from blood and urine were also collected. Findings A total of 1731 cases of E. coli bacteraemia were included. The urogenital tract was the most frequently reported source of infection (51.2% of cases) with previous treatment for a urinary tract infection being the largest independent effect associated with this infection source. Half of all patients had previous healthcare exposure in the month prior to the bacteraemia with antimicrobial therapy and urinary catheterization being reported in one-third and one-fifth of these patients, respectively. Previous healthcare exposure was associated with a higher proportion of antibiotic non-susceptibility in the blood culture isolates (P = 0.001). Conclusion Analysis of risk factors suggests the potential benefit of community- and hospital-related interventions, especially the better use of urinary catheters and improved antibiotic management of urinary tract infections. As part of the latter strategy, antibiotic resistance profiles need to be closely monitored to ensure that treatment guidelines are up to date to limit inappropriate empiric therapy. © 2016

TI  - Simplifying Residual Nitrogen (N<Sub>Min</Sub>) Sampling Strategies And Crop Response
JO  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Globally, important nitrogen fertilizer decisions are often made at the early stages of plant development, when plants are not yet sufficiently indicative of their needs. Optimizing nitrogen fertilization of crops requires assessing the available soil mineral nitrogen content (N-min) at the beginning of the season and was assessed exemplarily for wheat and maize. Since 2020 a mandatory soil N-min, analysis for each crop on a representative field is required in Germany in zones characterized by increased nitrate concentrations in the groundwater, encompassing approximately 28 \% of the arable land. However, soil analysis is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive and requires further optimization beyond the current practice. In this study, wheat fields in 2018 and 2019 and maize fields in 2018 were sampled in a grid pattern in spring, and the soil nitrate-N content was determined in 30 cm layers down to 60 cm soil depth in 11 fields and further down to 90 cm soil depth in two of the fields. For each single and the combined soil depths, all fields could be sampled with a deviation of less than 10 kg nitrate-N ha(-1) with only two soil samples. Overall, the reduced fieldspecific soil sampling strategy proved advantageous compared to crop-specific, regionally representative N-min, values offered by the official advisory authorities based on multiple averaged field investigations with an increased sampling intensity of 16 samples per field. Further, the reduced field-specific soil sampling strategy delivered more precise N-min, values by 11.2 kg nitrate-N ha(-1) for wheat fields and slightly less precise values by 4.8 kg nitrate-N ha(-1) for maize fields. The reduced field-specific soil sampling has great potential to reduce analysis and soil sampling costs. Nitrogen fertilization experiments supported the usefulness of the new simplified N-min, strategy. Multispectral in-season satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 could not adequately capture the spatial nitrate-N level differences and confirms soil samplings needs early in the season. Because most farmers base their fertilization strategy on regionally crop-specific aggregated N-min, values delivered by the official advisory system, we consider a simplified strategy to be more indicative of the field-specific soil N-min, status, which is eased by a markedly reduced sampling frequency and further simplifies the analysis by aggregating the separately analyzed soil depths to only one single depth. Further, currently available simplified on-farm analyses of the soil nitrate content allow for conducting more intensive field-specific soil N-min, analysis, thus contributing to improved nitrogen demand management and decreasing adverse environmental effects.

TI  - Using Satellite Remote Sensing To Survey Transport-Related Urban Sustainability. Part 1: Methodologies For Indicator Quantification
JO  - International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation
PY  - 2006
AB  - Urban sustainable development (SD) is a key concern of policy and decision-makers. As a result, numerous sustainability studies have been commissioned by government agencies that have led to the recommendation of suites of indicators to assess a host of related socio-economic and environmental issues. Many of these indicators have been described in concept only and a major challenge for science remains in translating verbal indicator descriptions into quantifiable measures. A Landsat-based Canadian national urban land database is being generated at the Canada Centre of Remote Sensing along with a set of urban sustainability indicators as value-added information to support informed transportation energy policy decision-making. This paper addresses indicator quantification, using the remote-sensing derived urban land use data, in the context of urban transportation-related energy consumption resulting from urban sprawl. Our work on quantification of sustainability indicators involves extraction of information about the characteristics of urban form (density, compactness and land use mix) and analysis of its impacts on land use efficiency, transportation and the environment. A generalized methodology for the categorization of indicators is presented based the level of information input and sophistication of computation needed for their quantification. Four indicators are discussed (population density, compactness, travel mode index and probability of travel distance) that span the category spectrum. Each indicator presents unique challenges in achieving its quantification in the form of information integration, analytic formulation or modeling. Example results for the cities of Ottawa-Gatineau and Calgary provide a preliminary insight into the difficulties in utilizing indicators for inter-city sustainability comparisons.

AB  - Summary form only given. The Earth Observing System (EOS) has the potential to be of crucial value in the US and international efforts to obtain sufficient understanding of the earth system to allow predictions to be made of its variability and evolution over the next few decades and centuries. Achieving that potential requires that the copious data expected to be produced by the EOS spacecraft beginning in 1995 be readily available to the earth system science community. It is argued that the development of an adequate information management and communications system must begin now in order to be ready to take advantage of EOS.

JO  - Revista de Biologia Marina y Oceanografia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Sea turtles are migratory species that occupy several marine and coastal habitats along their different life stages. The study of the spatial and temporal distribution of these vertebrates has been revolutionized with technological advances such as satellite telemetry, which in the last two decades has substantially increased its implementation. This technology attends the need of knowing and locating their critical habitats (such as inter-nesting, migrating, feeding and mating) as well as know their migratory movements for the understanding of their biology and protection through the deployment of satellite transmitters on sea turtle individuals. Because the cost of a satellite transmitter is high, its effective deployment on a sea turtle in a quickly, safely, and firmly way is of vital interest to the researcher to ensure that the transmitter persists for an extended time maximizing the information contribution and benefit the research. In this context, the objective of this contribution is to describe and document experiences applying standardized and verified methodological steps for deploying satellite transmitters on hard shell marine turtles. This contribution represents a documented and step-by-step viable description on the path to have clear and versatile basis as reference for the satellite transmitter deployments. © 2018, Universidad de Valparaiso.

TI  - The Rights Of Foreign Investors Over Land According To Investment Protection Treaties: A View From Latin America
JO  - ACDI Anuario Colombiano de Derecho Internacional
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the last ten years foreign investment in agriculture has increased notably in Latin America. Foreign investors, as much private as state, are interested on agricultural production, either for an expected benefit, or to assure the food supply. This increase in investment can be positive for the countries of the region. Nevertheless, in order to carry out this determination it is necessary to understand, among other things, the legal effects of these investment flows. This work maintains that the property rights acquired by foreign investors over the land and their agricultural undertakings may be different from the rights of national investors. This is because of foreign investment protection treaties. The strengthening of the rights of foreign investors affects the relationship between these investors and the receiving state. This article analyzes the effects of the rights of foreign investors in ration to five categories of state initiatives. Specifically, they are 1) the right to export production or the cost of exportation in the face of commercial and taxation measures; the right to continue a project in the face of changes within the regulatory paradigm; 3) the right to continue a project in the face of political change or new social preferences; 4) the right to receive better compensation in the face of agricultural reforms or programmes of historical reparation; 5) the right to maintain the business plan in the face of a food crisis. © 2016, Universidad del Rosario.

TI  - Revealing Preferences For Urban Biodiversity As An Environmental Good
JO  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Biodiversity is essential for human well-being, but little is known about urban dwellers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban biodiversity. Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers' WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators. This finding is significant for benefit transfer studies and primary biodiversity valuation in regions with limited data availability. The results can inform biodiversity conservation and management decisions by highlighting the importance of incorporating urban biodiversity in biodiversity policies.

TI  - Nasa's Global Precipitation Measurement Mission: Leveraging Stakeholder Engagement & Applications Activities To Inform Decision-Making
JO  - Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment
PY  - 2023
AB  - The application of satellite precipitation estimates from NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission for decision-making has been a focus for the mission since launch. As a result, GPM data have enabled a range of applications that address societal needs, including water resource management, crop forecasting, ecological monitoring, disaster response, public health, aviation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling, among others. GPM applications activities have continued to focus on user engagement through in person trainings and interviews, workshops, webinars, and educational outreach activities. The goals of these efforts are to synthesize community data needs in order to effectively support and enable decision-making across agencies, academia and the global community. While these efforts have helped the GPM mission establish a large stakeholder community that encompasses federal and state partners, academic institutions, and private and nonprofit companies, there remains difficulties associated with accessing, processing, and applying the data to support or enable applications. In this article, we present GPM applications strategies and approaches used to enhance the applications value of GPM data, and most importantly, demonstrate how these efforts have and can inform different decision-making contexts. This work also provides a discussion on key lessons learned from the user community and how this information can be utilized to help better support and shape applications approaches for future NASA Earth Science missions. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Mapping Above Ground Carbon Storage And Sequestration In Thoria Watershed, India: A Spatially Explicit Ecosystem Service Assessment Using Invest Model
JO  - 2022 10th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics, Agro-Geoinformatics 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - Globally, the commons provide important ecosystem functions and services and contribute towards sustainable development and human population. About 2.5 billion people depend on these commons for many material and non-material benefits and to support and improve their livelihoods. However, the contribution of the commons to the smallholder farmers and the economy are not very clear. Quantitative analysis of the contribution of ecosystem services will help to develop policies to better support their management and allocate resources to protect them. In this study, we assess the carbon storage and sequestration of the commons in the Thoria watershed, India using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. InVEST is a suite of spatially explicit models for evaluating trade-offs associated with land-use induced ecosystem service changes, developed by the partners of the Natural Capital Project. The InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model uses maps of land use along with stocks in carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape or the amount of carbon sequestered over time. Aboveground biomass comprises all living plant material above the soil (e.g., bark, trunks, branches, leaves). The model maps carbon storage densities to LCLU rasters which may include classes such as forest, pasture, or agricultural land. The carbon stocking contents of over a hundred samples are measured in the field among major land cover types. The average of carbon stocking values is used and assigned to designated land cover types. The LCL U map is developed by using a machine learning algorithm with Landsat 7 imageries and ground truth points collected by the local collaborators. The model summarizes results into raster outputs of storage, sequestration, and value, as well as aggregate totals. The ground truth data and remotely sensed data are used to calibrate the parameters of the model inputs. We also perform two scenario analyses: 1) expansion of forest, 2) expansion of agricultural land. The two land-use scenarios are generated using proximity-based approaches where the user determines which land-use type can be converted to, as well as the type of patterns based on proximity of the edge of focal land use. Results of the scenario analysis demonstrate the potential changes of carbon stocking to land cover and land-use change. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Retrospective Analysis Of Recent Flood Events With Persistent High Surface Runoff From Hydrological Modelling
PY  - 2014
AB  - Floods are one of the most common and widespread disasters in India, with an estimated 40Mha of land prone to this natural disaster (National Flood Commission, India). Significant loss of property, infrastructure, livestock, public utilities resulting in large economic losses due to floods are recurrent every year in many parts of India. Flood forecasting and early warning is widely recognized and adopted as non-structural measure to lower the damages caused by the flood events. Estimating the rainfall excess that results into excessive river flow is preliminary effort in riverine flood estimation. Flood forecasting models are in general, are event based and do not fully account for successive and persistent excessive surface runoff conditions. Successive high rainfall events result in saturated soil moisture conditions, favourable for high surface runoff conditions. The present study is to explore the usefulness of hydrological model derived surface runoff, running on continuous times-step, to relate to the occurrence of flood inundation due to persistent and successive high surface runoff conditions. Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), a macro-scale hydrological model, was used to simulate daily runoff at systematic grid level incorporating daily meteorological data and land cover data. VIC is a physically based, semi-distributed macroscale hydrological model that represents surface and subsurface hydrologic process on spatially distributed grid cell. It explicitly represents sub-grid heterogeneity in land cover classes, taking their phenological changes into account. In this study, the model was setup for entire India using geo-spatial data available from multiple sources (NRSC, NBSS\&LUP, NOAA, and IMD) and was calibrated with river discharge data from CWC at selected river basins. Using the grid-wise surface runoff estimates from the model, an algorithm was developed through a set of thresholds of successive high runoff values in order to identify grids/locations with probable flooding conditions. These thresholds were refined through iterative process by comparing with satellite data derived flood maps of 2013 and 2014 monsoon season over India. India encountered many cyclonic flood events during Oct-Dec 2013, among which Phailin, Lehar, and Madi were rated to be very severe cyclonic storm. The path and intensity of these cyclonic events was very well captured by the model and areas were marked with persistent coverage of high runoff risk/flooded area. These thresholds were used to monitor floods in Jammu Kashmir during 45 Sep and Odisha during 8-9 Aug, 2014. The analysis indicated the need to vary the thresholds across space considering the terrain and geographical conditions. With respect to this a sub-basin wise study was made based on terrain characteristics (slope, elevation) using Aster DEM. It was found that basins with higher elevation represent higher thresholds as compared to basins with lesser elevation. The results show very promising correlation with the satellite derived flood maps. Further refinement and optimization of thresholds, varying them spatially accounting for topographic/terrain conditions, would lead to estimation of high runoff/flood risk areas for both riverine and drainage congested areas. Use of weather forecast data (NCMWRF, (GEFS/R)), etc. would enhance the scope to develop early warning systems.

TI  - Development And Validation Of A Case Definition To Estimate The Prevalence And Incidence Of Cirrhosis In Pan-Canadian Primary Care Databases
JO  - CANADIAN LIVER JOURNAL
PY  - 2023
AB  - Aims:To develop and validate case definitions to identify patients with cirrhosis and alcohol-related cirrhosis using primary care electronic medical records (EMRs) and to estimate cirrhosis prevalence and incidence in pan-Canadian primary care database, between 2011 and 2019.Methods:A total of 689,301 adult patients were included with >= 1 visit to a primary care provider within the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Study Network between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Subsample of 17,440 patients was used to validate the case definitions. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated with their 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and then determined the population-level prevalence and incidence trends with the most accurate case definition.Results:The most accurate case definition included: >= 1 health condition, billing, or encounter diagnosis for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 571.2, 571.5, 789.59, or 571. Sensitivity (84.6; 95\% CI: 83.1-86.\%), specificity (99.3; 95\% CI: 99.1-99.4\%), positive predictive values (94.8; 95\% CI: 93.9-95.7\%), and negative predictive values (97.5; 95\% CI: 97.3-97.7\%). Application of this definition to the overall population resulted in a crude prevalence estimate of (0.46\%, 95\% CI: 0.45\%-0.48\%). Annual incidence of patients with a clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis nearly doubled between 2011 (0.05\%, 95\% CI: 0.04\%-0.06\%) and 2019 to (0.09\%, 95\% CI: 0.08\%-0.09\%).Conclusions:The EMR-based case definition accurately captured patients diagnosed with cirrhosis in primary care. Future work to characterize patients with cirrhosis and their primary care experiences can support improvements in identification and management in primary care settings.

TI  - Responsible Use Of Agile Robots In Public Spaces
JO  - Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science and Technology: Engineering and Corporate Social Responsibility, ETHICS 2021
PY  - 2021
AB  - In late 2019, a quadruped agile robot, named Spot, was introduced by the robotics company Boston Dynamics for lease to the public. Spot found quick commercial success and social media fame with its sophisticated computer vision enabled inspection and environmental data collection capacity as well as its hypermobility. Spot was also leased by non-commercial organizations such as metropolitan police departments that integrated Spot into various aspects of their operations. Civil rights groups have criticized these deployments of Spot into public spaces based on its potential weaponization and its repeated use in poor and marginalized communities. Law enforcement organizations have responded to the conflict over their use of Spot in a variety of ways. This paper examines the issues raised by the increased use of agile robots through a combination of case studies and ethical design frameworks. We argue that while it may be too late to completely prohibit the use of this technology in public spaces, it is imperative that different stakeholder groups (i.e. technologists, policy makers, ethicists, etc.) must come together now to lay the groundwork for the responsible design, development, and deployment of agile robots. Several models for proactive computing ethics work are presented for stakeholder engagement around complex public safety, security, and equity concerns. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The economics and financing of satellite communications is a very large and complex topic. It ranges from normal business planning, analysis, and investment financing, to issues of government policy, dual-use technologies, and national security and defense. Commercial satellite systems represent a special case of economic analysis since such systems are heavily dependent on a government market that is focused on political considerations of budgeting and regulation. Today, satellite telecommunications systems are critical to almost all nations of the world, and they are especially important in the approximately 60 nations that have domestic launch and/or satellite operations capabilities. This chapter will specifically focus on four topics: (1) a summary of the economic characteristics of the industry and a review of major trends in the industry, (2) a summary of the elements of a business plan for satellite telecommunications, (3) an analysis of issues in the manufacturing productivity for satellites and an analysis of commercial satellite manufacturing compared to government satellites, and (4) a brief discussion of future cost considerations including the increasing risk of space sustainability, insurance, and rules concerning disposal of satellites after their useful lifetime. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

TI  - Mangrove Mapping And Change Detection In Ca Mau Peninsula, Vietnam, Using Landsat Data And Object-Based Image Analysis
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2015
AB  - Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem goods and services for human society. Extensive coastal development in many developing countries has converted mangrove forests to other land uses without regard to their ecosystem service values; thus, the ecosystem state of mangrove forests is critical for officials to evaluate sustainable coastal management strategies. The objective of this study is to investigate the multidecadal change in mangrove forests in Ca Mau peninsula, South Vietnam, based on Landsat data from 1979 to 2013. The data were processed through four main steps: 1) data preprocessing; 2) image processing using the object-based image analysis (OBIA); 3) accuracy assessment; and 4) multitemporal change detection and spatial analysis of mangrove forests. The classification maps compared with the ground reference data showed the satisfactory agreement with the overall accuracy higher than 82%. From 1979 to 2013, the area of mangrove forests in the study region had decreased by 74%, mainly due to the boom of local aquaculture industry in the study region. Given that mangrove reforestation and afforestation only contributed about 13.2% during the last three decades, advanced mangrove management strategies are in an acute need for promoting environmental sustainability in the future. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Open Spaces And Urban Ecosystem Services Cooling Effect Towards Urban Planning In South American Cities
JO  - TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2014
AB  - Open space (OS) is a key element in the provision of ecosystem services (ES) in urban environments. Under a land cover-land use perspective, cities are incorporating into the expansion process to different types of surfaces: sealed, paved surfaces and OS. The first corresponds to a land cover change while the second, which includes bare soil, grass, forest or any other type of nonsealed surface, corresponds to a land use change, without physical transformations. As a land use change OS is able to keep fundamental pre-existing ecological properties. However, besides specific ecological characteristics, the overall capacity to provide ES depends also on the size, number and spatial distribution of OSs within the urban fabric. Those aspects which can determine the very ecological performance of urban ecosystem services (UES) are not yet included in the current urban planning in Latin America. OS is still understood mainly as green infrastructure and related mostly with aesthetic and cultural benefits. On the contrary, under an ecological point of view, OS is capable to provide fundamental UES, which can be spatially assessed and analyzed. In this paper the provision of cooling services (CS) is assessed in 2 South American cities: Lima and Santiago de Chile. The provision of CS is measured by means of a Remote Sensing-GIS-based method. Two aspects of CS are explored: (1) the current amount of existing OS; and (2) the trend of increasing/reducing CS within the urban tissue, in a dynamic assessment of spatial distribution and rates of OS incorporation to the continuous urban tissue. The aim is to analyze the CS generated by OS in those two cities. The analysis discusses the role of OS in the provision of CS, considering the current urban development trends and planning practice in these specific Latin American cities, highlighting the need to keep unsealed surfaces and increase in trees coverage, to retain the CS provision in certain levels.

TI  - Adjoint Inverse Modeling Of No<I><Sub>X</Sub></I> Emissions Over Eastern China Using Satellite Observations Of No<Sub>2</Sub> Vertical Column Densities
JO  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2009
AB  - A four-dimensional variational data assimilation system for optimization of NOx emissions (RC4-NOx) was developed. A parameterized NOx chemistry scheme was introduced into the RC4-NOx system, and key parameters such as chemical production and loss terms of NOx were calculated in advance using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. RC4-NOx was applied to optimize NOx emissions over eastern China (EC) in July 1996,1999, and 2002 using Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite observations of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and a priori emissions from the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS). After assimilation, RC4-NOx generally reproduced the spatial distribution, regional averaged values, and time evolution of GOME NO2 VCDs. Over EC, a priori emissions were reduced by 20\% in 1996 and by 8\% in 1999, whereas a posteriori emissions were almost the same as a priori emissions in 2002. A priori emissions in the Beijing region were reduced by optimization over the whole simulation period. A posteriori emissions over the Yangtze Delta were larger than a priori emissions in 2002, although they were smaller in both 1996 and 1999. As in other areas, a priori emissions over the North China Plain were reduced in 1996; but those over the eastern part of the plain were increased in 1999, and the area of increased emissions moved slightly westward in 2002. In each region, the growth rates of a posteriori emissions during both 1996-1999 and 1999-2002 became generally larger than those of a priori emissions, and the trends of a posteriori emissions became similar to those of GOME NO2 VCDs. Our inverse modeling analysis indicates that the rate of increase of NO, emissions over EC from 1996 to 2002 was much larger for a posteriori emissions (49\%) than for a priori emissions (19\%).

Here we aimed to develop an approach to design ecological corridor by employing the ecological source - resistance surface - ecological corridor framework in combination with semi-natural habitat planning and ecosystem service trade-off assessment. ‘Ecological source patches’ were identified based on a ‘Remote Sensing Ecological Index’ (RSEI) to objectively classify ecological and environmental conditions. Our resulting spatial resistance surface was further modified used based on the ‘Cultivated Land Use Intensity’ index, to derive a high accuracy and rationality of ecological corridor extraction in agriculture landscape. While planning the ecological network, key nodes and resulting semi-natural habitat (SNH) distribution were identified using Linkage Mapper tools and circuit theory. We constructed ecological network scenarios with different amounts of semi-natural habitats and calculated resulting regional ecosystem service values (ESV) using an equivalence factor method to explore optimal spatial layouts. The results showed, while regional ecosystem service values generally increased in line with semi-natural habitat area contained within the ecological network, ecological networks with forests covering 10% of the total area were predicted as an optimal scenario balancing ecosystem services with agricultural yield in the study region. Networks with mixed forest and grassland cover totaling 20% of the area represented an alternative choice that strongly enhanced regional ecosystem services while may still allowing for high agricultural productivity. In constructing corridors, identifying, restoring and protecting key ecological nodes using targeted management and habitat restoration, while protecting existing wetlands and other water bodies that support regional water cycle and supply services, should be prioritized. Regional policy measures furthermore need to promote targeted ecological network planning to help improve the overall sustainability of agricultural production. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Soil Erosion Assessment In Basaltic-Associated Landscapes Of Central India Using Integrated Approach Of Rusle, Remote Sensing And Gis
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Soil Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Deforestation, wastelands, intensive cultivation and more marginal lands under plough sans soil and water conservation measures have collectively induced soil erosion causing a threat to long-term soil productivity. Soil erosion models coupled with remote sensing and GIS techniques can provide a quantitative and consistent approach for reasonable soil loss estimates and sediment yield covering large areas. Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) factors viz., R, K, LS, C, and P were derived using meteorological data, temporal LANDSAT-TM data, land use/land cover, NDVI, soil maps, Cartosat-1 DEM and expert knowledge to compute soil loss in Nagpur district of Maharashtra. The R factor values ranged from 359.34 to 512.95 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1. The values of K factor for different soil series ranged between 0.02 and 0.26. The LS factor ranged from 0 to 50. The C factor, generated using the relationship between C-factor and NDVI, ranged from 0-1. The P factor varied from 0.1 to 1.0. The RUSLE factors were integrated in GIS framework to compute soil loss. The soil loss values have been reclassified into five classes viz., minimal (0-5 t ha-1 yr-1), low (5-15 t ha-1 yr-1), moderate (15-25 t ha-1 yr-1), severe (25-50 t ha-1 yr-1) and extreme (>50 t ha-1 yr-1) and a soil loss map was generated. The data indicate that majority of the area in the district (60.3% of TGA) was under minimal to low soil erosion, 4.3% of TGA was under moderate, whereas, severe to extreme soil loss was observed to the extent of 27.4% of TGA. Severe (25-50 t ha-1 yr-1) and extreme (>50 t ha-1 yr-1) soil erosion areas are located on moderate to very steeply sloping lands of hills and ridges, escarpments which needs immediate attention for soil and water conservation measures to improve the productivity of these lands. Five prioritized soil conservation units have been delineated using a weighted multi-criteria analysis in Arc GIS (version 10.2.2) taking into account the soil loss, slope, soil depth, soil texture and land cover. Suitable soil and water conservation measures and appropriate land use options have been suggested for each conservation unit for land resource development and management. © 2019, IndianJournals.com.

AB  - The Natural Reserves Fund (NRF) has a special environmental and other value and functions to preserve the natural diversity of landscapes, maintain the overall ecological balance and provide background monitoring of the environment (Law of Ukraine "About Nature Reserve Fund of Ukraine"). The preservation, development and effective use of NRF, the formation of a national network of environmental protection areas and its integration into the All-European Econet is an extremely urgent task of Ukraine state policy. Nowadays, NRF protected areas, especially national nature parks, regional landscape parks, etc. have become increasingly popular among tourists. The number of recreants and tourists is increasing. Recreants and tourists are important stakeholders in territory management in Carpathian region. They are interested in staying in natural environment and sites with the uppermost visual attractive values. Recreants most of all need high level of natural resources for treatment and rehabilitation (mineral waters, climatic factors, etc.). (Liashenko et al., 2021). That is why the necessity of sustainable recreational nature management is increasing, too. The most powerful recreational nature management instruments are GIS. These technologies are convenient for describing recreational resources quality and availability. They are useful for spatial data analyses, synthesis and visualizing with modern cartographic resources; web maps, web atlases, tourist web portals, etc. © 2022 International Conference of Young Professionals, GeoTerrace 2022.

TI  - Mapping Fine-Scale Population Distributions At The Building Level By Integrating Multisource Geospatial Big Data
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
PY  - 2017
AB  - Fine-scale population distribution data at the building level play an essential role in numerous fields, for example urban planning and disaster prevention. The rapid technological development of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in recent decades has benefited numerous population distribution mapping studies. However, most of these studies focused on global population and environmental changes; few considered fine-scale population mapping at the local scale, largely because of a lack of reliable data and models. As geospatial big data booms, Internet-collected volunteered geographic information (VGI) can now be used to solve this problem. This article establishes a novel framework to map urban population distributions at the building scale by integrating multisource geospatial big data, which is essential for the fine-scale mapping of population distributions. First, Baidu points-of-interest (POIs) and real-time Tencent user densities (RTUD) are analyzed by using a random forest algorithm to down-scale the street-level population distribution to the grid level. Then, we design an effective iterative building-population gravity model to map population distributions at the building level. Meanwhile, we introduce a densely inhabited index (DII), generated by the proposed gravity model, which can be used to estimate the degree of residential crowding. According to a comparison with official community-level census data and the results of previous population mapping methods, our method exhibits the best accuracy (Pearson R=.8615, RMSE=663.3250, p<.0001). The produced fine-scale population map can offer a more thorough understanding of inner city population distributions, which can thus help policy makers optimize the allocation of resources.

TI  - Evaluation Of Long-Term Estuarine Vegetation Changes Through Landsat Imagery
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - Salt marshes support estuarine biodiversity and provide ecosystem services; however, their general decay is being observedworldwide, in large part due to land reclamation. Accordingly, there is a growing concern about saltmarsh preservation status having in mind the promotion of effective management decisions towards their conservation and restoration. Satellite imagery offers the opportunity tomonitor land surface dynamics, constituting a fundamental information source for wetland monitoring. This study analyses spatial and temporal vegetation changes within Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon between 1984 and 2017, by processing and analyzing TM and ETM+ Landsat imagery. A database consisting of 264 cloud-free images was collected and analyzed. The Normalized DifferenceWater Index was computed using the remote surface reflectance and was then used to distinguish land from water and to estimate the flooded lagoon area. Moreover, the tidal statewas determined for each image froma tidal elevation record monitored at the lagoon entrance. Subsequently, four vegetation indices (VI) were computed and their spatial variability in the lagoon area uncovered by waterwas assessed. Spatially averaged spectral indiceswere also statistically analyzed and seasonal variations and interannual trends evaluated. Results show that the intertidal area increased, and VI values decreased indicating a possible reduction in the Chlorophyll content and suggesting that the new intertidal regions are mostly covered by mud. The spatially averaged VI values show seasonal patterns, with peaks in spring and summer, coinciding with high biomass productivity periods. The largest flooded area and VI modifications occurred after 1999, suggesting that changes are associated with dredging activities performed in themain lagoon channels. This study reinforced the potential of Landsat archives tomonitor coastalwetlands, highlighting their importance for coastal managers of threatened systems, and therefore helping to define management strategies about the ecological conservation of estuarine systems.

TI  - Automatic Detection Of Ships In Radarsat-1 Sar Imagery
JO  - Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2001
AB  - NOAA/NESDIS has initiated a program called the Alaska SAR Demonstration with the goal of demonstrating the utility of RADARSAT-1 C-band SAR imagery to provide useful, timely environmental and resource management information to users in Alaska. One product generated under the program is a list of ship locations. This paper describes the algorithm developed to generate this product by automatically detecting ships based on changes in the local statistics. Using low resolution imagery (100 metres sample spacing) it is shown that ships of lengths greater than 35 metres can be detected (representing 105 ships out of a total of 272 in the test set) with a false alarm rate of 0.01% for a single detection. With high-resolution imagery (50 metres sample spacing) ships of lengths greater than 32 metres can be detected (representing 124 ships out of 272) with a false alarm rate of 0.002% for a single detection. The algorithm is completely automated and takes approximately 10 minutes of elapsed time to run on a ScanSAR Wide B Mode image. © Canadian Journalof Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de teledetection.

TI  - Sentinel-2 And Aisa Airborne Hyperspectral Images For Mediterranean Shrubland Mapping In Catalonia
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Mediterranean ecosystem exhibits a particular geology and climate, which is characterized by mild, rainy winters and long, very hot summers with low precipitation; it has led to the emergence of resilient plant species. Such habitats contain a preponderance of shrubs, and collectively harbor 10% of the Earth’s species, thus containing some of the most unique shrubby formations protecting against environmental natural degradation. Due to shrub species diversity, initial phases of forestland, heterogenous grasses, bare ground and stones, the monitoring of such areas is difficult. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to assess semi-automatic classifications of the shrubby formations based on multispectral Sentinel-2 and visible and near infrared (VINR) AISA-EAGLE II hyperspectral airborne images with a support of Canopy High Model (CHM) as a three-dimensional information and field-verified patterns, based on Match-T/DSM and aerial photos. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers have been tested on a few scenarios featuring different combinations of spectral and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformed bands and vegetation indices. Referring to the results, the average overall accuracy for the SVM and AISA images (all tested data sets) was 78.23%, and for the RF: 79.85%. In the case of Sentinel-2, the SVM classifier obtained an average value of 83.63%, while RF: 85.32%; however, in the case of the shrubland, we would like to recommend the RF classifier, because the highest mean value of F1-score achieved was 91.86% (SVM offered few-percent-point worse results), and the required training time was quicker than SVM. Commonly available Sentinel-2 data offered higher accuracies for shrubland monitoring than did the airborne VNIR data. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Determining The Cost Of Implementing And Operating A Remote Patient Monitoring Programme For The Elderly With Chronic Conditions: A Systematic Review Of Economic Evaluations
JO  - Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare
PY  - 2018
AB  - Introduction: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) in conjunction with home nursing visits is becoming increasingly popular for the follow-up of patients with chronic conditions and evidence exists that it improves patients’ health outcomes. Current cost data is reported inconsistently and often gathered from studies of poor methodological quality, making it difficult for decision-makers who consider implementing this service in their organizations. This study reviewed the cost of RPM programmes targeting elderly patients with chronic conditions. Methods: After evaluation against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and appraisal against two criteria which are important for economic evaluations, data from selected studies were extracted and grouped into meaningful cost categories, then adjusted to reflect November 2015 US dollars. Results: In the 13 selected studies, the newly-created cost category ‘Combined intervention cost’ (reflecting equipment purchasing, servicing and monitoring cost) for the various RPM programmes ranged from US$275–US$7963 per patient per year. The three main findings are: (a) RPM programme costs have decreased since 2004 due to cheaper technology; (b) monitoring a single vital sign is likely to be less costly than monitoring multiple vital signs; and (c) programmes targeting hypertension or congestive heart failure are less costly than those targeting respiratory diseases or multiple conditions. Conclusions: This review recommends that future studies present their cost data with more granularity, that grouping of costs should be minimized and that any assumptions, such as amortization, should be made explicit. In addition, studies should compare programmes with similar characteristics in terms of type of conditions, number of vital signs monitored, etc. for more generalizable results. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - Capability Of Crop Water Content For Revealing Variability Of Winter Wheat Grain Yield And Soil Moisture Under Limited Irrigation
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Understanding its water status is important for irrigation planning. A few crop water indicators, such as the leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT: g cm−2), leaf water content (LWC: %) and canopy water content (CWC: kg m−2), have been estimated using remote sensing techniques for a wide range of crops, yet their suitability and utility for revealing winter wheat growth and soil moisture status have not been well studied. To bridge this knowledge gap, field-scale irrigation experiments were conducted over two consecutive years (2014 and 2015) to investigate relationships of crop water content with soil moisture and grain yield, and to assess the performance of four spectral process methods for retrieving these three crop water indicators. The result revealed that the water indicators were more sensitive to soil moisture variation before the jointing stage. All three water indicators were significantly correlated with soil moisture during the reviving stage, and the correlations were stronger for leaf water indicators than that of the canopy water indicator at the jointing stage. No correlation was observed after the heading stage. All three water indicators showed good capabilities of revealing grain yield variability in jointing stage, with R2 up to 0.89. CWC had a consistent relationship with grain yield over different growing seasons, but the performances of EWT and LWC were growing-season specific. The partial least squares regression was the most accurate method for estimating LWC (R2 = 0.72; RMSE = 3.6%) and comparable capability for EWT and CWC. Finally, the work highlights the usefulness of crop water indicators to assess crop growth, productivity, and soil water status and demonstrates the potential of various spectral processing methods for retrieving crop water contents from canopy reflectance spectrums. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Optimization Of Effects-Assessment Of Greenside Darter (Etheostoma Blennioides) Exposed To Tertiary Treated Municipal Wastewater Based On Seasonal Changes Of Reproductive Endpoints
JO  - Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry
PY  - 2014
AB  - The present study describes the seasonal changes in reproductive endpoints of the greenside darter (Etheostoma blennioides) and its implications for environmental monitoring. Fish collections conducted at the appropriate time for the site-specific sentinel fish species can provide a wide variety of population-level information including recruitment, reproduction, and energy storage. The objectives of the present study were to: 1) characterize seasonal changes in reproductive endpoints of the greenside darter (both sexes) to determine the appropriate period for monitoring of this sentinel species; and 2) evaluate the effect of exposure of this sentinel species to tertiary treated municipal effluent at the selected monitoring period. Based on the selected parameters (gonadosomatic index [GSI], liver somatic index [LSI], condition factor, and in vitro gonadal steroid production [testosterone (T) in both sexes; estradiol (E2) in females; and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) in males]), the present study provides evidence for the value of collecting darters during recrudescence (late fall/early winter) to ensure temporal stability, minimum variability, and stable steroid production capacity. Darters exposed to tertiary treated municipal effluent tended to be larger and heavier relative to reference fish but did not demonstrate any consistent responses in terms of condition or relative liver size. No effect on gonadal development was observed, even though these tertiary-effluent-exposed fish demonstrated a significant reduction in the ability to produce hormones. The present study suggests that although fish exposed to tertiary treated effluent demonstrate no population-level effects, they are still responding at a physiological level. Documentation of the reproductive cycle of sentinel species allows for selection of the most appropriate sampling period to reduce variability and greatly enhances the reliability and interpretation of biological responses. © 2014 SETAC.

TI  - Habitat Choices Of African Buffalo (Syncerus Caffer) And Plains Zebra (Equus Quagga) In A Heterogeneous Protected Area
JO  - Wildlife Research
PY  - 2020
AB  - Context: An understanding of large herbivore habitat choices in heterogeneous African protected areas is important for the better management of these key ecosystems. Aims: To determine habitat use of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and plains zebra (Equus quagga) in a heterogeneous protected area. Methods: Zambezi National Park (ZNP), Zimbabwe, was divided into five vegetation types using an unsupervised classification on a Landsat satellite image that was classified into five land cover classes, using the K-means classification algorithm. African buffalo and plains zebra densities were then determined in each vegetation type using road transect surveys monthly between January 2013 and December 2015. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), grass biomass, grass height and grass quality (nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and acid detergent fibre content) were determined in each vegetation type during the wet (November to April) and dry (August to October) seasons to establish their quality as habitats for African buffalo and plains zebra. Key results: Both African buffalo and plains zebra mostly foraged in mixed and grassland areas, and avoided Zambezi teak vegetation type. Zambezi teak vegetation type had high NDVI due to the dense tree cover. Both African buffalo and plains zebra preferred vegetation types with intermediate grass biomass (approximately 300 g m-2) and grass height (approximately 16 cm). Grass nutritive value (in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and acid detergent fibre) declined from wet to dry season in all vegetation types. Conclusions: African buffalo and plains zebra in the ZNP confined their habitat use mostly to two vegetation types (mixed and grassland), which together covered 25% of the protected area. Implications: Teak (Baikiaea plurijuga) vegetation, which accounted for about 60% of the ZNP, was avoided by both African buffalo and plains zebra, suggesting that a significant part of the protected area was not used by the two herbivores. © 2020 CSIRO.

TI  - Assessing The Effectiveness Of Land Restoration Interventions In Dry Lands By Multitemporal Remote Sensing - A Case Study In Ouled Dlim (Marrakech, Morocco)
JO  - LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2015
AB  - Atriplex nummularia has been extensively planted in Northern Africa to combat desertification. However, few studies evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions. This study aimed at assessing the dynamic performance of a number of Atriplex plantations located in the Marrakech province in terms of multitemporal dry biomass production. Three SPOT 5 images (2004, 2008 and 2012) and field biomass measurements were integrated to quantify the dry biomass production dynamics of plantations established from 1996 to 2007. Different plant ages covered the whole plant life cycle curve. Vegetation indices were derived from the images and those of 2012 were coupled to the measured biomass of 2012 to formulate biomass models. An analysis of shrub biomass production was conducted in plantations and in adjacent rangelands, covering varying degree of plant development, and an estimate of the economic benefits generated by the plantations in terms of available fodder biomass was performed. The results show that, on average, the plantation sites produced 221 to 361Mgha(-1) of dry biomass more than the surrounding rangelands. The best performing plantations yielded even greater differences, up to more than 7Mgha(-1). It was observed that the most performing plantations, while contributing to mitigating land degradation, have generated economic value and could compensate the economic cost of the intervention even under drought conditions. However, in several cases the plantation performance was far from sustainability, particularly due to poor management (early and/or over grazing), revealing that management is a critical factor for the success of this restoration practice.

TI  - Geographic Information Systems (Gis) And Remote Sensing - A Guide For Parameter Development In Water Resources And Environmental Modelling
PY  - 1991
AB  - Development in both software and hardware engineering in the last decade has resulted in the proliferation of GIS and remote sensing packages. While computer-based packages have experienced dramatic cost reductions to levels 'affordable' by most firms and government agencies, and cost is no longer considered a significant barrier for GIS/Remote Sensing Technology acquisition, the average practicing professionals has not benefitted from the innovative and powerful tools these systems offer. One of the basic reasons preventing the popularization of GIS/Remote Sensing among Civil Engineer practitioners, is the lack of knowledge. Many professionals have not received formal GIS training in college and can seldom afford to attend rather expensive specialized systems-oriented training sessions at work. A second applies to the majority of professionals who have gained a basic familiarity of these systems, but feel overwhelmed by their assumed complexity and packaged-oriented application. This paper is being presented to aid the practicing professionals in the process of GIS/Remote Sensing technology acquisition and transference to project work. Guidelines will be offered for development of input parameters for impact modelling in water resources and environmental modelling. Vector and raster (grid cell) GIS database structures will be qualified for use in model parameter development. Specific impact model data structures will be analyzed for linkage to GIS and Remote Sensing.

PY  - 2023
AB  - (1) Background: Satellite monitoring of fire effects is widespread, but often satellite-derived values are considered without respect to the characteristic severity of fires in different vegetation types or fire areas. Particularly in regions with discontinuous vegetation or narrowly distributed vegetation types, such as the state of Utah, USA, specific characterization of satellite-derived fire sensitivity by vegetation and fire size may improve both pre-fire and post-fire management activities. (2) Methods: We analyzed the 775 medium-sized (40 ha <= area < 400 ha) and 697 large (>= 400 ha) wildfires that occurred in Utah from 1984 to 2022 and assessed burn severity for all vegetation types using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio. (3) Results: Between 1984-2021, Utah annually experienced an average of 38 fires >= 40 ha that burned an annual average of 58,242 ha with a median dNBR of 165. Fire was heavily influenced by sagebrush and shrubland vegetation types, as these constituted 50.2\% (17\% SD) of area burned, a proportion which was relatively consistent (18\% to 79\% yr(-1)). Medium-sized fires had higher mean severity than large fires in non-forested vegetation types, but forested vegetation types showed the reverse. Between 1985 and 2021, the total area burned in fires >= 40 ha in Utah became more concentrated in a smaller number of large fires. (4) Conclusions: In Utah, characteristic fire severity differs both among vegetation types and fire sizes. Fire activity in the recent past may serve as an informative baseline for future fire, although the long period of fire suppression in the 20th century suggests that future fire may be more active. Fire managers planning prescribed fires < 400 ha in forests may find the data from medium-sized fires more indicative of expected behavior than statewide averages or vegetation type averages, both of which are weighted to large fires.

TI  - Water Accounting Plus (Wa+) - A Water Accounting Procedure For Complex River Basins Based On Satellite Measurements
JO  - Hydrology and Earth System Sciences
PY  - 2013
AB  - Coping with water scarcity and growing competition for water among different sectors requires proper water management strategies and decision processes. A prerequisite is a clear understanding of the basin hydrological processes, manageable and unmanageable water flows, the interaction with land use and opportunities to mitigate the negative effects and increase the benefits of water depletion on society. Currently, water professionals do not have a common framework that links depletion to user groups of water and their benefits. The absence of a standard hydrological and water management summary is causing confusion and wrong decisions. The non-availability of water flow data is one of the underpinning reasons for not having operational water accounting systems for river basins in place. In this paper, we introduce Water Accounting Plus (WA+), which is a new framework designed to provide explicit spatial information on water depletion and net withdrawal processes in complex river basins. The influence of land use and landscape evapotranspiration on the water cycle is described explicitly by defining land use groups with common characteristics. WA+ presents four sheets including (i) a resource base sheet, (ii) an evapotranspiration sheet, (iii) a productivity sheet, and (iv) a withdrawal sheet. Every sheet encompasses a set of indicators that summarise the overall water resources situation. The impact of external (e.g., climate change) and internal influences (e.g., infrastructure building) can be estimated by studying the changes in these WA+ indicators. Satellite measurements can be used to acquire a vast amount of required data but is not a precondition for implementingWA+ framework. Data from hydrological models and water allocation models can also be used as inputs to WA+. © Author(s) 2013.

TI  - Framework For Structural Health Monitoring Of Steel Bridges By Computer Vision
JO  - SENSORS
PY  - 2020
AB  - The monitoring of a structural condition of steel bridges is an important issue. Good condition of infrastructure facilities ensures the safety and economic well-being of society. At the same time, due to the continuous development, rising wealth of the society and socio-economic integration of countries, the number of infrastructural objects is growing. Therefore, there is a need to introduce an easy-to-use and relatively low-cost method of bridge diagnostics. We can achieve these benefits by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing. In our study, we present a state-of-the-art framework for Structural Health Monitoring of steel bridges that involves literature review on steel bridges health monitoring, drone route planning, image acquisition, identification of visual markers that may indicate a poor condition of the structure and determining the scope of applicability. The presented framework of image processing procedure is suitable for diagnostics of steel truss riveted bridges. In our considerations, we used photographic documentation of the Fitzpatrick Bridge located in Tallassee, Alabama, USA.

TI  - Videoconference-Based Education For Psychiatry Registrars At The University Of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa
JO  - African Journal of Psychiatry (South Africa)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objective: Psychiatry registrars form the backbone of specialized psychiatric service provision in South Africa. Medical schools are centralized while clinical services need to be widespread and accessible. Video-conferencing has the potential to link registrars at satellite hospitals with academic centers. The study thus evaluated of the use of videoconferencing in a Psychiatry Education Program delivered via videoconferencing. Method: To evaluate the implementation of the videoconference-based psychiatry registrar program, a pre- and post evaluative design was used. This involved all registrars in the 2008 and 2009 academic education program at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Access to education, satisfaction, suitability and costs of the psychiatry registrar education were studied. Results: In the evaluation of the Registrar Program, general satisfaction with the videoconferencing program was reported, though concerns were expressed about the level of interaction using this mode, the quality of the transmitted pictures of the anatomy specimens and the quality of the sound. Access to education was improved with potential cost savings identified. Conclusion: Well supported and planned videoconference-based teaching is a feasible, cost-effective and acceptable method of supporting registrars at sites distant from academic centers.

TI  - Winter Habitat Indices (Whis) For The Contiguous Us And Their Relationship With Winter Bird Diversity
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - The seasonal dynamics of snow cover strongly affect ecosystem processes and winter habitat, making them an important driver of terrestrial biodiversity patterns. Snow cover data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites can capture these dynamics over large spatiotemporal scales, allowing for the development of indices with specific application in ecological research and predicting biodiversity. Here, our primary objective was to derive winter habitat indices (WHIs) from MODIS that quantify snow season length, snow cover variability, and the prevalence of frozen ground without snow as a proxy for subnivium conditions. We calculated the WHIs for the full snow year (Aug-Jul) and winter months (Dec-Feb) across the contiguous US from 2003/04 to 2017/18 and validated them with ground-based data from 797 meteorological stations. To demonstrate the potential of the WHIs for biodiversity assessments, we modeled their relationships with winter bird species richness derived from eBird observations. The WHIs had clear spatial patterns reflecting both altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in snow cover. Snow season length was generally longer at higher latitudes and elevations, while snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow were highest across low elevations of the mid latitudes. Variability in the WHIs was largely driven by elevation in the West and by latitude in the East. Snow season length and frozen ground without snow were most accurately mapped, and had correlations with station data across all years of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. Snow cover variability was accurately mapped for winter (r = 0.79), but not for the full snow year (r = -0.21). The model containing all three WHIs used to predict winter bird species richness patterns across the contiguous US was by far the best, demonstrating the individual value of each index. Regions with longer snow seasons generally supported fewer species. Species richness increased steadily up to moderate levels of snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow, after which it steeply declined. Our results show that the MODIS WHIs accurately characterized unique gradients of snow cover dynamics and provided important information on winter habitat conditions for birds, highlighting their potential for ecological research and conservation planning.

TI  - Cost Factors In Urban Telemedicine
JO  - Medical Care
PY  - 1977
AB  - This paper reports on the cost effectiveness of a pediatric primary care system utilizing nurse practitioners (NPs) linked to a physician consultant through bidirectional interactive cable television. In addition, it discusses ways in which multiple uses enhance the economic feasibility of a telemedicine consultation link in a given geographic area. The overall consultation rate during periods of remote physician coverage was 21 per cent, compared with 24 per cent during on-site coverage. The telephone became a partial substitute for the TV for some uses but could not replace it in diagnostic decisions. As telemedicine is obviously underutilized in a one-satellite system, we compare a five-satellite network with other ways of delivering service. The resulting estimated cost of $18.50 an hour, or 2/3 of the cost of a physician providing direct care, includes a TV component of $5.30 an hour of use in a 1,750-hour year. The critical factor is that the NP can be a physician substitute if there is TV backup. The TV appears to prevent unnecessary referrals compared to a physician on site. Whether TV increases the length of the consult compared to the phone for conditions of equal severity is not entirely clear. If TV is compared to transporting a patient to a central place, the implicit value of transport time and disutility required to justify using TV is $7.55 per consult in a five-clinic network. Geographic and other barriers to physician availability enhance the potential for application of telemedicine. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.

TI  - A Comparison Of Multispectral Aerial And Satellite Imagery For Mapping Intertidal Seaweed Communities
JO  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
PY  - 2018
AB  - 1. Habitat- forming seaweeds are vital components of marine ecosystems, supporting immense diversity and providing ecosystem services. Reports of major changes in the distribution and abundance of large brown seaweeds in the north- east Atlantic are an increasing cause for concern, but a lack of consistent monitoring over time is a key impediment in obtaining reliable evidence of change. There is an urgent need to recognize change rapidly and efficiently in marine communities, which are increasingly affected by pressures of human population growth, climate change, and ocean acidification. 2. Here, the potential for remote monitoring of seaweed habitats is investigated using freely available, high- resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Three sources of imagery were used: ( i) Channel Coastal Observatory ( CCO) aerial imagery; ( ii) aerial images from the Bing webmap server; and ( iii) RapidEye multispectral satellite data. 3. The study area, the Thanet Coast, is an area of chalk outcrop in south- east England of high conservation status, and includes three Marine Conservation Zones. Eight habitat classes, including brown, red, and green algal zones, were recognized based on ground- truthing surveys. 4. A multi- class classification model was developed to predict habitat classes based on the chromatic signature derived from the aerial images. The model based on the high- resolution CCO imagery gave the best outcome ( with a kappa value of 0.89). 5. Comparing predictions for images in 2001 and 2013 revealed habitat changes, but it is unclear as to what extent these are natural variability or real trends. This study demonstrates the potential value for long- term monitoring with remote- sensing data. Repeated, standardized coastal aerial imaging surveys, such as those performed by CCO, permit the rapid assessment and re- assessment of habitat extent and change. This is of value to the conservation management of protected areas, particularly those defined by the presence or extent of specific habitats.

TI  - Radiative Transfer Modeling To Measure Fire Impact And Forest Engineering Resilience At Short-Term
JO  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest managers demand reliable and cost-efficient methodologies to implement forest resilience concepts in post-fire decision-making at different spatio-temporal scales. In this paper, we developed a generalizable remote sensing-based tool to measure disturbance impact and engineering resilience at short-term in forest ecosystems affected by wildland fires. The case study was a mixed-severity wildfire that burned several shrubland (dominated by gorse, broom and heath) and tree forest (dominated by oak and pine) ecosystems. Specifically, we retrieved fractional vegetation cover (FVC) over a time-series of pre and post-fire Deimos-2 imagery (spatial resolution of 4 m) from a radiative transfer model (RTM) hybrid inversion approach (Gaussian processes regression algorithm learned from a simulation dataset generated using the PROSAIL-D model). Pre and post-fire FVC retrieval was validated with field data stratified by dominant ecosystem. High accuracy (>90\%) and low error (<7\%) were achieved in the retrieval over the time-series, despite the influence of background signal of soil and burned legacies. A random point sampling stratified by ecosystem and burn severity was used to extract validated FVC values for the time-series. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to evaluate the effect of burn severity along the time-series on FVC for each ecosystem. One-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's pairwise comparison test were applied to determine the earliest point in the time-series for which the FVC does not differ significantly from the pre-fire FVC. In tree forest ecosystems, the fire impact on FVC was stronger at high burn severity, being similar the impact on shrub ecosystems at medium and high burn severity. Engineering resilience was conditioned both by burn severity and species regenerative strategies. In ecosystems dominated by facultative or obligate seeders, pre-fire FVC was reached later across the time-series, compared to resprouter-dominated ecosystems. The RTM hybrid inversion tool has proved its reliability for assessing disturbance impact and ecosystem engineering resilience at short-term in heterogeneous fire-prone landscapes affected by mixed severity wildfires.

TI  - Road Extraction From A High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Image Based On Richer Convolutional Features
JO  - IEEE Access
PY  - 2018
AB  - The extraction and vectorization of roads from high spatial resolution remote sensing (HSRRS) images are of great significance to city planning and development. However, significant as they are, it is usually an arduous task to put them into practice because the HSRRS images are often filled with complex ground information. Furthermore, extracted roads may suffer from netsplit or brokenness. This paper thus proposes Richer convolutional features (RCFs)-based road extraction (Road-RCF) as a method which targets these issues. A modified roads sample set and RCF network are applied to generate road probabilities in order to extract initial road information. After the road centerlines extraction by the refinement algorithm, vectorized roads are ultimately extracted. The compared experiment results show that the Road-RCF method produce better road extraction results than the other four state-of-the-art methods, in both quantitative road extraction accuracy metrics and the qualitative visual evaluation. The benefits of this model are threefold. First, the image-to-image network structure of side-output realizes multi-scale and multi-level road feature fusion in order to make a full use of the information from a low level to a high level. Second, according to the deep supervision of the side-output, it guides the learning of the correct road information. Third, after the detection of the road, the road centerlines are vectorized to facilitate the attribute information management and electronic map production. In a word, the proposed Road-RCF method is both practical and meaningful toward updating the geo-information system database. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Assessment Of Soil Erosion By Universal Soil Loss Equation Model Based On Geographic Information System Data: A Case Study Of The Mafragh Watershed, North-Eastern Algeria
JO  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
PY  - 2023
AB  - Soil resources in Algeria are limited by physical surface area, geogenic, and anthropogenic degradation. Given the importance of food production, soil resource management is an essential part of Algeria's long-term agricultural development. Furthermore, soil erosion is one of the serious natural environmental problem, affects millions of hectares of arable farmland. Soil erosion assessments coupled with hydrologic modeling is tool to estimate this phenomenon and is useful for watershed management and conservation. In this study, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) data to assess annual soil erosion rates in the Mafragh watershed located in northeastern Algeria. The aim was to generate practical erosion risk maps of the catchment area. Results showed that 74 \% of the watershed is within a tolerant erosion rate (A value between 0 and 1), while the remaining 26 \% of the study area is classified under moderate to severe erosion risk (A value between 1 and > 10). The study suggests considering these results when evaluating soil erosion management practices to ensure sustainable agricultural development in the region.\& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Prescribed Burning Benefits Threatened Mammals In Northern Australia
JO  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite substantial investment in prescribed burning for biodiversity conservation there has been surprisingly little demonstration of its efficacy in achieving intended conservation aims for fauna. In the case of northern Australia's threatened mammal fauna, most studies have reported negative responses to fire. We used satellite-derived fire scar imagery and small mammal survey data to compare fire regimes and threatened mammal abundance before and after implementation of broad-scale prescribed burning in north-western Australia. Specifically, we tested: (1) whether prescribed burning was effective in changing fire regimes; (2) whether all mammal species and functional groups responded to prescribed burning; and (3) what regional fire and environmental variables explained changes in mammal status. Low-intensity, patchy prescribed burning in the early dry season reduced the extent of high intensity late dry season wildfires. In sandstone habitats the abundance of all mammals, and the large marsupials and specialist rodent functional groups, increased concurrently with early dry season prescribed burning. All mammals and the small dasyurid functional group in woodland habitats also increased during this period. Early dry season prescribed burning extent was the strongest explanatory variable for mammal increases. Early dry season burning was also the strongest explanatory variable for woodland mammal abundance, but these mammals also had a positive association with extent of large patches of old growth vegetation (> 4 years since fire). Generalist rodents did not respond to prescribed burning and two other species declined following prescribed burning in one habitat. Generalist rodents and the two declining species had a negative association with extent of late dry season fire and a positive association with old growth vegetation (interacting with patch size). These results suggest an increased application of patchy early dry season prescribed burning of up to ca. 30\% of the area will benefit positive fire responder species of threatened mammals including large specialist rock/arboreal rodents and most marsupial species. For mammals such as generalist terrestrial rodents with predominantly negative associations with fire, managers should seek to increase the size and extent of old growth vegetation.

TI  - Cropland Prediction Using Remote Sensing, Ancillary Data, And Machine Learning
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Temporal and spatial environmental factors have a substantial influence on crop yields, and an accurate prediction can benefit timely decision-making in global food production. Thus for better agricultural management, the precise estimation of the croplands is helpful. Mapping the cropland dynamics with regular requirement of crops is an important prerequisite for monitoring crops, yield estimation, and crop inventories. Remote sensing and geographic information systems play a significant role in tracing and understanding environmental impacts of agriculture. The use of machine learning aids in developing a model that can give precise predictions based on the historical data. The main objective of our study is to use these machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions about the best crop types using the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric features. A big dataset incorporating optical and polarimetric aperture radar experimental values is used to train the machine learning classifiers for predicting the right crop type in the study area. It has been observed that these features aid in accurate mapping of the cropland. Our study involves the performance comparison of the various machine learning algorithms, and it has been observed that a single-layer neural network offers prediction accuracy of similar to 99.6\% for this big PoISAR dataset.

TI  - Scale Effects Of Leaf Area Index Inversion Based On Environmental And Disaster Monitoring Satellite Data
JO  - Science China Earth Sciences
PY  - 2010
AB  - The spatial distribution of sub-pixel components has an impact on retrieval accuracy, and should be accounted for when inverting a three-dimensional adiative transfer model to retrieve leaf area index (LAI). To investigate this effect, we constructed three realistic scenarios with the same LAI values and other properties, except that the simulated plants had different distributions. We implemented the radiosity method to subsequently produce synthetic bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) datasets based upon these simulated scenes. The inversion was conducted using these data, which showed that spatial distribution affects retrieval accuracy. The inversion was also conducted for LAI based on charge-coupled device (CCD) data from the Environment and Disaster Monitor Satellite (HJ-1), which depicted both forest and drought-resistant crop land cover. This showed that heterogeneity in coarse-resolution remote sensing data is the main error source in LAI inversion. The spatial distribution of global fractal dimension index, which can be used to describe the area of sub-pixel components and their spatial distribution modes, shows good consistency with the coarse resolution LAI inversion error. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - A High-Resolution Map Of Singapore’s Terrestrial Ecosystems
JO  - Data
PY  - 2019
AB  - The natural and semi-natural areas within cities provide important refuges for biodiversity, as well as many benefits to people. To study urban ecology and quantify the benefits of urban ecosystems, we need to understand the spatial extent and configuration of different types of vegetated cover within a city. It is challenging to map urban ecosystems because they are typically small and highly fragmented; thus requiring high resolution satellite images. This article describes a new high-resolution map of land cover for the tropical city-state of Singapore. We used images from WorldView and QuickBird satellites, and classified these images using random forest machine learning and supplementary datasets into 12 terrestrial land classes. Close to 50 % of Singapore’s land cover is vegetated while freshwater fills about 6 %, and the rest is bare or built up. The overall accuracy of the map was 79 % and the class-specific errors are described in detail. Tropical regions such as Singapore have a lot of cloud cover year-round, complicating the process of mapping using satellite imagery.

TI  - Monitoring Of Agricultural Landscape In Norway
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2012
AB  - An overall societal aim is to ensure a sustainable use and management of agricultural landscapes. This requires continuous delivery of reliable and up-to-date information to decision-makers. To be able to deliver this information, a monitoring program for agricultural landscapes was initiated in Norway 13 years ago. The program documents and reports on land use / land cover changes from data captured through interpretation of true colour aerial photos using stereo instruments. The monitoring programme is based on a sample of 1000 squares of 1 x 1 km and the entire sample of squares is photographed over a five-year period. Each square is then mapped repeatedly every fifth year to record changes. Aerial photo interpretation is based on a custom classification system which is built up hierarchically, with three levels. The first level comprises seven land type classes: Agricultural land, Bare ground, Semi-natural open vegetation, Unforested wetland vegetation, Forest, Urban areas and Water. These land classes are further divided into 24 land types at level two, and approximately 100 land types at level 3. In addition to land type units we map both line elements like stone fences and point elements like buildings and solitary threes. By use of indicators that describe status and change focusing on themes of particular policy interest, we can report on whether policy aims are being fulfilled or not. Four indicator themes have been in focus hitherto: landscape spatial structure, biological diversity, cultural heritage and accessibility. Our data is stored in databases and most of the data quality check/structure process and analyses are now being made in open source software like PostGIS and PostSQL. To assess the accuracy of the photo-interpretation, ground truthing is carried out on 10 % of the squares. The results of this operation document the benefits of having access to photos of the same area from two different years. The program is designed first and foremost to provide reliable statistics at a national level but the aim is also to report at regional levels - for example for counties or for agricultural landscape regions. The national coverage and application of standardized methods enable frequent updating. This method is cost effective and enables us to quantify changes in landscape qualities as well as adapting the programme to take account of e.g. new findings on relevant indicators.

TI  - Cost Analysis Of A Multidisciplinary Vascular Anomaly Clinic
JO  - Annals of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objective: Multidisciplinary vascular anomaly clinics (VACs) offer important value to pediatric patients with complex vascular anomalies whose care overlaps specialties. These clinics are labor intensive and costly to operate since providers see fewer patients compared to their individual specialty clinic. Our North American tertiary care institution’s VAC specialists include a pediatric otolaryngologist, pediatric surgeon, pediatric plastic surgeon, pediatric dermatologist, and interventional radiologist. To assess financial feasibility, we conducted a cost analysis of our VACs comprised of 2 half-day multidisciplinary physician attended clinics (5 specialists at our main campus and 2 specialists at a satellite clinic) and a half-day nurse practitioner clinic. Method: Assessment of net revenue based on net collections for clinic, professional, operative, hospital setting, and facility charges generated during 12 consecutive monthly VACs beginning July 1, 2015. Expense calculations included provider and staff salaries, benefits, supply costs, and clinic leasing costs. Results: There were 469 clinic visits, of which 202 were new patient evaluations. Sixty-eight patients underwent 93 procedures under general anesthesia, including procedures performed by our interventional radiologist, most commonly sclerotherapy or embolization (n = 37), surgical interventions including endoscopy (n = 36), or laser procedures (n = 20). Three patients were admitted. Fifty-seven patients received a new diagnosis different from that for which they were referred. Gross revenue was $1 810 525, and net revenue was 42.5%, or $783 152. Expenses totaled $453 415 for a net positive revenue of $329 737. Conclusion: When including direct downstream revenue, particularly from operative procedures, our VAC program operates on a net positive margin, making the program financially feasible. © The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Karstic Water Storage Response To The Recent Droughts In Southwest China Estimated From Satellite Gravimetry
PY  - 2015
AB  - The water resources crisis is intensifying in Southwest China (SWC), which includes the world's largest continuous coverage of karst landforms, due to recent severe drought events. However, because of the special properties of karstic water system, such as strong heterogeneity, monitoring the variation of karstic water resources at large scales remains still difficult. Satellite gravimetry has emerged as an effective tool for investigating the global and regional water cycles. In this study, we used GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data from January 2003 to January 2013 to investigate karstic water storage variability over the karst region of SWC. We assessed the impacts of the recent severe droughts on karst water resources, including two heavy droughts in September 2010 to May 2010 and August 2011 to January 2012. Results show a slightly water increase tend during the studied period, but these two severe droughts have resulted in significant water depletion in the studied karst region. The latter drought during 2011 and 2012 caused more water deficits than that of the drought in 2010. Strong correlation between the variations of GRACE-based total water storage and precipitation suggests that climate change is the main driving force for the significant water absent over the studied karst region. As the world's largest continuous coverage karst aquifer, the karst region of SWC offers an example of GRACE applications to a karst system incisively and will benefit for water management from a long-term perspective in karst systems throughout the world.

TI  - Detection Of Alternaria Blight Disease Severity In Mustard Crops Using Ground-Based Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
JO  - Current Science
PY  - 2023
AB  - Alternaria blight is a destructive disease of mustard crops that causes significant economic loss and usually warrants extensive pesticide application. Characterization and estimation of pest severity for better management is the need of the hour to increase the scope of advisories to the farmers. In this study, statistical approaches like multiple stepwise linear regression, principal component regression and partial least square regression have been employed to detect the disease severity of Alternaria blight in mustard leaves using hyperspectral reflectance data. The predicted values of diseased leaves in all the regression models were significantly reduced vis-à-vis healthy mustard leaves. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to detect the disease severity of Alternaria blight in mustard crops using hyperspectral reflectance data. © (2023), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

TI  - New Built Land Threat Of Martapura River – Implementation Of Environmental Sustainability In Banjarmasin City, South Kalimantan, Indonesia
JO  - Journal of Ecological Engineering
PY  - 2023
AB  - The threat of environmental degradation of the Martapura River as a result of an increase in built-up land has become a serious problem, so it is important to implement a new method using the integration of calculations of changes in built-up land and the sustainability of river area environmental management. This study aimed to calculate the change in built-up land directly integrated through Rap-RiverBuiltUp quantitative analysis on the environmental sustainability of the Martapura river area, Banjarmasin City. The research method used is the technique of spatial analysis of ETM/Landsat 8 OLI satellite landsat images and analysis of ecological, social and economic sustainability with Rap-RiverBuiltUP analysis. The results of the analysis of built-up land around the Martapura river, Banjarmasin City, have increased by 2.31% over the last 12 years, followed by a growth in population density of ±1.5% annually. The implementation of sustainable environmental management needs to be prioritized with the efforts to periodically revise regional spatial planning regulations, especially the boundaries of built-up land to reduce the development of built-up land around the Martapura River. The sustainability status of the built-up area around the Martapura river is currently not sustainable. The ecological dimension indicates a less sustainable status, while the economic and social dimensions indicate a fairly sustainable status. Increasing the sustainability index value of the Martapura river from each dimension in the future is by making the lever factor an input for the management policy of the Martapura river, Banjarmasin City © 2023, Journal of Ecological Engineering.All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Estimation Of Ecological Footprint For Sidoarjo Regency And Its Implication Towards Spatial Development
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Sidoarjo Regency is one of buffer zones of Surabaya City in which directly adjacent with Surabaya at the south part of it. The highly economic growth of Surabaya has many direct y for Sidoarjo regency, mainly due to population growth and urban sprawl that bring negative impacts on sustainability. Decreasing of the productivity because of conversion of agricultural land into settlements and air pollution are major issues that occur in Sidoarjo regency. Regional development should be in line by efforts to conserve the environment so that take environmental carrying capacity into account is a must. Ecological footprint is one of approaches in the calculation of sustainability by identifying the components of consumption and emissions resulting from human activities for subsequent comparison with the availability of natural resources (biocapacity). Biocapacity consists of components of land productivity, ie agricultural land, forestry land, terrestrial fisheries, and constructed land that is processed using satellite imagery as resource. The difference between the ecological footprint calculation and the biocapacity indicates the sustainability of the Sidoarjo Regency. In conclusion, Sidoarjo regency has experienced ecological deficit level 1 with biocapacity value of 25,665 and ecological footprint value of 111,962. It is resulted that natural resources in Sidoarjo Regency are only able to accommodate approximately one-fourth of total consumption in Sidoarjo regency. This prediction could be used as consideration on spatial planning as well as spatial policies in terms of sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - An Overview Of The Impacts Of Fishing On Seabirds, Including Identifying Future Research Directions
JO  - ICES Journal of Marine Science
PY  - 2023
AB  - Knowledge of fisheries impacts, past and present, is essential for understanding the ecology and conservation of seabirds, but in a rapidly changing world, knowledge and research directions require updating. In this Introduction and in the articles in this Themed Set "Impacts of fishing on seabirds", we update our understanding of how fishing impacts seabird communities and identify areas for future research. Despite awareness of the problems and mitigation efforts for >20 years, fisheries still negatively impact seabirds via the effects of bycatch, competition, and discards. Bycatch continues to kill hundreds of thousands of seabirds annually, with negative population-level consequences. Fisheries for forage fish (e.g. anchovy, sandeel, and krill) negatively impact seabirds by competing for the same stocks. Historically, discards supplemented seabird diets, benefitting some species but also increasing bycatch rates and altering seabird community composition. However, declining discard production has led to potentially deleterious diet switches, but reduced bycatch rates. To improve research into these problems, we make the following recommendations: (1) improve data collection on seabird-vessel interaction and bycatch rates, on fishing effort and vessel movements (especially small-scale fleets), and on mitigation compliance, (2) counter the current bias towards temperate and high-latitude ecosystems, larger-bodied species and particular life stages or times of year (e.g. adults during breeding), and (3) advance our currently poor understanding of combined effects of fisheries and other threats (e.g. climate change, offshore renewables). In addition, research is required on under-studied aspects of fishing impacts: consequences for depleted sub-surface predators, impacts of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, artisanal and emerging fisheries, such as those targeting mesopelagic fish, have received insufficient research attention. Some of these shortfalls can be overcome with new tools (e.g. electronic monitoring, remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and big data) but quantifying and addressing fishing impacts on seabirds requires greater research investment at appropriate spatio-temporal scales, and more inclusive dialogue from grassroots to national and international levels to improve governance as fishing industries continue to evolve. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Kalbi S, Fallah A, Hojjati SM. 2014. Using and comparing two nonparametric methods (CART and RF) and SPOT-HRG satellite data to predictive tree diversity distribution. Nusantara Bioscience 6: 57-62. The prediction of spatial distributions of tree species by means of survey data has recently been used for conservation planning. Numerous methods have been developed for building species habitat suitability models. The present study was carried out to find the possible proper relationships between tree species diversity indices and SPOT-HRG reflectance values in Hyrcanian forests, North of Iran. Two different modeling techniques, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF), were fitted to the data in order to find the most successfully model. Simpson, Shannon diversity and the reciprocal of Simpson indices were used for estimating tree diversity. After collecting terrestrial information on trees in the 100 samples, the tree diversity indices were calculated in each plot. RF with determinate coefficient and RMSE from 56.3 to 63.9 and RMSE from 0.15 to 0.84 has better results than CART algorithms with determinate coefficient 42.3 to 63.3 and RMSE from 0.188 to 0.88. Overall the results showed that the SPOT-HRG satellite data and nonparametric regression could be useful for estimating tree diversity in Hyrcanian forests, North of Iran.

TI  - Water Conservation Benefits Of Urban Heat Mitigation
JO  - Nature Communications
PY  - 2017
AB  - Many cities globally are seeking strategies to counter the consequences of both a hotter and drier climate. While urban heat mitigation strategies have been shown to have beneficial effects on health, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, their implications for water conservation have not been widely examined. Here we use a suite of satellite-supported regional climate simulations in California to show that broad implementation of cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy, not only results in significant cooling, but can also meaningfully decrease outdoor water consumption by reducing evaporative and irrigation water demands. Irrigation water consumption across the major metropolitan areas is reduced by up to 9% and irrigation water savings per capita range from 1.8 to 15.4 gallons per day across 18 counties examined. Total water savings are found to be the highest in Los Angeles county, reaching about 83 million gallons per day. Cool roofs are a valuable solution for addressing the adaptation and mitigation challenges faced by multiple sectors in California. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Selective Logging In The State Of Mato Grosso Between 1992 And 2016
JO  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
PY  - 2020
AB  - Selective logging is a forestry activity that includes harvesting a group of tree species in native forests, usually those of higher value or commercial interest. Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km(2) of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km(2). Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km(2).year(-1) and 268.18 km(2).year(-1) of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso. Finally, it was concluded that selective logging is annually disturbing a considerable extension of native forests in the state of Mato Grosso and, therefore, needs to be adequately considered and monitored by environmental agencies due to its potential forest impacts and to support the definition of public policies to ensure the future sustainability of forest production in that state.

TI  - Mapping Eruption Affected Area Using Sentinel-2a Imagery And Machine Learning Techniques
JO  - Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management
PY  - 2023
AB  - Volcanic eruptions are natural disasters with significant environmental and societal impacts. Timely detection and monitoring of volcanic eruptions are crucial for effective hazard assessment, mitigation strategies, and emergency response planning. Remote sensing technology has emerged as a valuable tool for detecting and assessing the effects of volcanic eruptions. One of the challenges in remote sensing image processing is handling large data dimensions that are difficult to address using traditional methods. Machine learning approaches offer a suitable solution to tackle these challenges. Machine learning demonstrates increasing computational capabilities, the ability to handle big data and automation. This study aimed to compare different machine learning classification algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The data utilized in this study was derived from Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery, which was tested in areas affected by the eruption of Mount Agung, Bali Province, in 2017. The results indicated that the GMM algorithm performed the best among the machine learning classifiers, achieving an Overall Accuracy (OA) value of 82.04%. It was followed by RF (78.86%) and KNN (77.55%). The areas affected by volcanic eruptions were determined by overlaying disaster-prone regions with areas mapped using the machine learning approach. The total affected area was measured as 29.89 km2, with an additional 3.31 km2 outside the designated zone. The findings of this study serve as a guideline for governmental entities, stakeholders, and communities to implement effective mitigation efforts for disaster risk reduction. © 2023 Brawijaya University.

TI  - Learning Space-Time Crop Yield Patterns With Zigzag Persistence-Based Lstm: Toward More Reliable Digital Agriculture Insurance
JO  - Proceedings of the 36th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - More than US$ 27 billion is estimated to have been paid-out in farm support in USA alone since 1991 in response to climate change impacts on agriculture, with costs likely continuing to rise. With the wider adoption of precision agriculture - an agriculture management strategy that involves gathering, processing and analyzing temporal, spatial and individual data - in both developed and developing countries, there is an increasing opportunity to harness accumulating, shareable, big data using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, collected from weather stations, field sensor networks, Internet-of-Things devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, and Earth observational satellites. This requires smart algorithms tailored to agricultural data types, integrated into digital solutions that are viable, flexible, and scalable for wide deployment for a wide variety of agricultural users and decision-makers. We discuss a novel AI approach that addresses the real-world problem of developing a viable solution for reliably, timely, and cost-effectively forecasting crop status across large agricultural regions using Earth observational information in near-real-time. Our approach is based on extracting time-conditioned topological features which characterize complex spatio-temporal dependencies between crop production regions and integrating such topological signatures into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). We discuss utility and limitations of the resulting zigzag persistence-based LSTM (ZZTop-LSTM) as a new tool for developing more informed crop insurance rate-making and accurate tracking of changing risk exposures and vulnerabilities within insurance risk areas.

TI  - Learning A Spatial Ensemble Of Classifiers For Raster Classification: A Summary Of Results
JO  - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW
PY  - 2015
AB  - Given a spatial raster framework F, a set of explanatory feature maps, training and test samples with class labels on F, as well as a base classifier type, the problem of ensemble learning in raster classification aims to learn a collection of base classifiers to minimize classification errors. The problem has important societal applications such as land cover classification but is challenging due to existence of class ambiguity from spatial heterogeneity, i.e., Samples with the same feature values may have distinct class labels in different areas. Many existing approaches are non-spatial ensembles (e.g., Bagging, boosting, random forest), which assume that learning samples follow an identical distribution. Some spatial ensemble approaches also exist, which simply partition the raster framework into several regular sub-blocks and combine classification results on each sub-block. However, these existing approaches can not address the class ambiguity issue among pixels. In contrast, this paper proposes a new spatial ensemble approach, which partitions the spatial framework into several spatial footprints to minimize class ambiguity of training samples and then learns a base classifier for each footprint. Experimental evaluations on a real world remote sensing dataset show that the proposed spatial ensemble approach outperforms existing approaches when strong class ambiguity exists. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel combination of object features to both match buildings from predisaster images to shapes in a postdisaster image and assess damage on those buildings. These features include scale profile ratios extracted from a tree of shapes representation of the original image as well as texture features. A supervised classifier is used to classify building damage into three representative classes tied to the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98). The method is compared to visual inspection results as well as other automated methods. Results clearly show the benefits of our method for fast crisis mapping applications with few human inputs required. © 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Tailoring Therapies-Improving The Management Of Early Breast Cancer: St Gallen International Expert Consensus On The Primary Therapy Of Early Breast Cancer 2015
JO  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
PY  - 2015
AB  - The 14th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2015) reviewed substantial new evidence on locoregional and systemic therapies for early breast cancer. Further experience has supported the adequacy of tumor margins defined as 'no ink on invasive tumor or DCIS' and the safety of omitting axillary dissection in specific cohorts. Radiotherapy trials support irradiation of regional nodes in node-positive disease. Considering subdivisions within luminal disease, the Panel was more concerned with indications for the use of specific therapies, rather than surrogate identification of intrinsic subtypes as measured by multiparameter molecular tests. For the treatment of HER2-positive disease in patients with node-negative cancers up to 1 cm, the Panel endorsed a simplified regimen comprising paclitaxel and trastuzumab without anthracycline as adjuvant therapy. For premenopausal patients with endocrine responsive disease, the Panel endorsed the role of ovarian function suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane for patients at higher risk. The Panel noted the value of an LHRH agonist given during chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER-negative disease in protecting against premature ovarian failure and preserving fertility. The Panel noted increasing evidence for the prognostic value of commonly used multiparameter molecular markers, some of which also carried prognostic information for late relapse. The Panel noted that the results of such tests, where available, were frequently used to assist decisions about the inclusion of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with luminal disease, but noted that threshold values had not been established for this purpose for any of these tests. Multiparameter molecular assays are expensive and therefore unavailable in much of the world. The majority of new breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths now occur in less developed regions of the world. In these areas, less expensive pathology tests may provide valuable information. The Panel recommendations on treatment are not intended to apply to all patients, but rather to establish norms appropriate for the majority. Again, economic considerations may require that less expensive and only marginally less effective therapies may be necessary in less resourced areas. Panel recommendations do not imply unanimous agreement among Panel members. Indeed, very few of the 200 questions received 100\% agreement from the Panel. In the text below, wording is intended to convey the strength of Panel support for each recommendation, while details of Panel voting on each question are available in supplementary Appendix S2, available at Annals of Oncology online.

TI  - The Alfacrux Cubesat Mission Description And Early Results
JO  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
PY  - 2022
AB  - On 1 April 2022, the AlfaCrux CubeSat was launched by the Falcon 9 Transporter-4 mission, the fourth SpaceX dedicated smallsat rideshare program mission, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida into a Sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km. AlfaCrux is an amateur radio and educational mission to provide learning and scientific benefits in the context of small satellite missions. It is an opportunity for theoretical and practical learning about the technical management, systems design, communication, orbital mechanics, development, integration, and operation of small satellites. The AlfaCrux payload, a software-defined radio hardware, is responsible for two main services, which are a digital packet repeater and a store-and-forward system. In the ground segment, a cloud-computing-based command and control station has been developed, together with an open access online platform to access and visualize the main information of the AlfaCrux telemetry and user data and experiments. It also becomes an in-orbit database reference to be used for different studies concerned with, for instance, radio propagation, attitude reconstruction, data-driven calibration algorithms for satellite sensors, among others. In this context, this paper describes the AlfaCrux mission, its main subsystems, and the achievements obtained in the early orbit phase. Scientific and engineering assessments conducted with the spacecraft operations to tackle unexpected behaviors in the ground station and also to better understand the space environment are also presented and discussed.

TI  - Remote Sensing And Economic Indicators For Supporting Water Resources Management Decisions
JO  - Water Resources Management
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper demonstrates that combining spatial land surface data with socio-economic analysis provides a number of indicators to strengthen decision making in integrated water and environmental management. It provides a basis to: track current water consumption in the Inkomati Basin in South-Africa; adjust irrigation water management; select crop types; facilitate planning; estimate crop yields before harvesting, and consequently to forecast market price development. Remote sensing data and economic analysis can also be used to study the spatial distribution of water consumption as an indicator of equity in access to water resources. It even enables identification of farms that consume more irrigation water than formally allocated. Finally, it provides a basis to assess the cost-effectiveness of various ways to reduce agricultural water consumption. So, this approach is potentially useful for determining water consumption, refining water allocation policies, and determining the potential for water transfers through mechanisms such as water trading. © 2009 The Author(s).

TI  - Study Of Drought Using Meteorological And Remote Sensing Data (Azarbaijan Province)
JO  - Journal of the Earth and Space Physics
PY  - 2018
AB  - In recent years, drought has created a destructive impact on the ecology, water resources management, and ecological processes. In this context, appropriate and appropriate method for predicting and monitoring the drought could have a significant impact in neutralizing the effect of this natural phenomenon. In this research, drought monitoring and evaluation of data from MODIS images were used in the extraction of NDVI and DVI indices. The study area of West Azarbaijan province is one of the northwest provinces of the country. In this study, images of meteorological index of drought or wet year have been used. ArcGIS 9.3 has been used to prepare and perform the necessary corrections on the images, as well as to prepare the vegetation cover index (NDVI) and vegetation difference index (DVI) using ENVI 4.5 software, to classify the results and output in the formg images. The aim of this study was to evaluate meteorological droughts using SPI and ZSI as monthly intervals and also determine the correlation between vegetation and meteorological droughts that happened in this area. The results of SPI and ZSI indices indicate that in the first three months of the year, the vegetation is moderate in the prevailing region, and in the second quarter of the year, the maps indicate weak and uncoated vegetation, because the rainfall is very limited in this time. On the other hand, in these months of the year, overgrazing has caused plant degradation. Vegetation in the first three months of the year seems to have had more favorable conditions due to the melting of snow and winter and autumn rainfall of the previous year. Percentage of vegetation coverage in the study area for the wet years 1383, 1385, 1390 and 1393, was respectively reported as 19.85%, 19.5%, 19.6% and 19.5% and also in the drought years 1384, 1387, and 1389 it was calculated as 18.71%, 18.7% and 19% respectively. The results of SPI and ZSI indices indicate that in the first three months of the year, the vegetation is moderate in the prevailing region, and in the second quarter of the year, the maps indicate weak and uncoated vegetation because the rainfall is very limited at this time. On the other hand, in these months of the year, overgrazing has caused plant degradation. Should be cautious about further action beacause One NDVI index is correlated with meteorological drought indices SPI and ZSI which is varied with respect to the short-term and long-term interval respectively. The result confirmed that NDVI and SPI indices were appropriate for monitoring and assessment of drought. The highest correlation values between NDVI and DVI was observed for short term intervals of SPI and ZSI (1, 2 and 3 months). Generally the highest correlation values during the statistical period between NDVI and SPI was obtained as well as in the year when normal drought conditions were reported. In addition, the determination of trends of the indices using the Man Kendall test indicated that there exist a downward trend in all indices and there was an increase in drought and vegetation decline during the statistical period. © 2018 Institute of Geophysics.

TI  - Ecohydrological Footprint And Climate Trends In Lotic Ecosystems Of Central Western Ghats
JO  - WATER
PY  - 2023
AB  - An ecohydrological assessment of lotic ecosystems would provide insights into understanding the symbiotic interactions of hydrological and ecological processes for sustainable catchment management to ensure water security and achieve sustainable development goals (SDG). Global monitoring reveals changing climate patterns due to the unabated anthropogenic activities altering the ecohydrological behavior of waterscapes and thus affecting the sustenance of natural resources. The current research investigates the ecohydrological footprint using a modified water balance method by accounting for climatic and land-use trends across three river catchments in the northern portion of the Central Western Ghats. Assessment of landscape dynamics using temporal remote sensing data indicates the reduction in forest cover in Mahadayi, Ghataprabha, and Malaprabha river basins with increased anthropogenic activities. Evaluation of climate trends shows rising temperatures over 0.4 \& DEG;C in the last century with increasing rainfall. The consequence of enhanced rainfall is increased overland flows to the extent of 35-80\% in all river basins. Water availability in streams during all seasons is evident in the catchment dominated by native forest cover, while streams are intermittent and seasonal at the transition zone and plains. Analyses of temperature and rainfall in the last century indicate higher spatial variations directly influencing surface and subsurface hydrology. The reduced native forest cover has directly affected the variations in the local temperatures and precipitation patterns. This highlights the need for maintaining the ecological integrity of watersheds with native vegetation cover for sustaining the natural resources (water, etc.) that support the livelihood of farmers with socio-economic benefits.

TI  - Wearables: Useful Sentinels Of Our Health?
JO  - Homeland Security Affairs
PY  - 2020
AB  - As U.S. Coast Guard units develop strategies and policies aimed at safely reconstituting forces in the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to identify and isolate personnel who may be infected as early as possible is critical to protecting the organization’s most critical resource. Existing wearable technologies provide the ability to monitor physiological data markers accurately and continuously. While unable to provide a direct diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, these markers may present a viable means for remotely identifying early onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and isolating potentially infected and infectious members. Additionally, the use of wearables has shown potential in some studies to act as a behavior change catalyst, which could enable workforce members to develop improved health and rest habits, leading to a more resilient and virus-resistant workforce. As a military entity, the Coast Guard possesses unique and previously untested authorities regarding the ability to impose a mandatory monitoring program on its members. However, given the political implications of such a strategy, a voluntary program may provide a better option for expeditious implementation. As the Coast Guard seeks short-term ways to protect its members from COVID-19 exposure and long-term strategies to facilitate the development of a more resilient workforce, wearables may provide a supplemental advantage worth their financial investment, though more study is necessary to validate their utility toward that end.

TI  - Multi-Vegetation Index Soil Moisture Inversion Model Based On Uav Remote Sensing
JO  - Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi/Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis
PY  - 2024
AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor affecting agricultural production and plays a vital role in crop growth and final yield. Rapid and efficient estimation of soil water content has become a hot issue in agricultural and forestry water resources monitoring. It has been widely recognized and applied to calculate vegetation index and build soil water content inversion model by using the characteristic bands of hyperspectral reflectance. Because of the problem that the inversion of soil water content is greatly affected by vegetation coverage, we propose to use multi vegetation index combination to weaken the influence of vegetation coverage on the inversion of soil water content. Thirty groups of citrus trees were selected as samples in the Cangwubang test base of Yichang City. The soil was collected at the drip line of the fruit tree, and the soil mass moisture content was determined by the drying method. Four times of sampling, a total of 120 groups of soil moisture content. We use the ASD Field Spectral FR spectrometer (wavelength range: 325 ~ 1075 nm) and the Dajiang Genie 4 multispectral UAV to obtain the spectral reflectance in the blue, green, red, red edge, near-infrared and short wave infrared bands of 120 groups of test areas. We pretreat the spectral data with the moving average method for noise reduction, compare and analyze 9 vegetation indices with gray correlation method, and screen out 4 vegetation indices that are highly significantly related to soil water content (p < 0.01). The correlation between each index and soil water content from high to low is the bare soil index (BSI), normalized blue-green differential vegetation index (NGBDI), green normalized index (GNDVI) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). The correlation between BSI and soil water content is the highest, and the correlation coefficient is −0.687. We use the linear stepwise regression method and nonlinear BP neural network method to build a soil water content inversion model based on multi vegetation index and take the determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and relative error (ARE) as the evaluation indexes of the inversion accuracy of the model. The results show that the R2 between the inversion value of soil water content and the measured value of the stepwise regression model and BP neural network model are 0.816 and 0.889 respectively, the RMSE is 2.54% and 1.53% respectively, and the ARE is 21.13% and 8.88% respectively. It shows that the nonlinear BP neural network algorithm based on multi vegetation index combination has higher accuracy in soil moisture inversion based on vegetation index modeling, and can overcome the influence of different vegetation coverage on the accuracy of soil moisture inversion to a certain extent. As an effective alternative method to measure soil moisture directly, it provides theoretical support for quantitative decision-making and scientific agricultural irrigation management. © 2024 Science Press.

TI  - Patterns And Implications Of Land Use/Cover Change - A Case Study In Pranmati Watershed (Garhwal Himalaya, India)
JO  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2002
AB  - Land use/cover changes during the period 1963-1993 and their ecological and socioeconomic implications in Pranmati Watershed in the Indian Himalaya were analyzed on the basis of information extracted from archival records, satellite data, participatory discussions, and field measurement. Agricultural land use was practiced on 14.2\% of the watershed area in 1963 compared with 18.5\% in 1993. More than 50\% of the agricultural expansion occurred in community forests between 1850 and 2400 m and on 20-30degrees slopes. The increase in area under cash crops, potato, and amaranth accompanied an 86\% increase in the mean monetary value of crop produce but at the cost of abandoning the traditional crops Fagopyrum esculentum, F. tataricum, Panicum miliaceum, and Setaria italica. Agricultural land use changes were such that mean manure input at the watershed scale increased by 50\%, and fodder output from crops decreased by 40\%, implying the increasing pressure on forests. Local forest management institutions have not been adequately empowered to respond to the growing economic aspirations of people and the increasing population pressure. Research and policy support for improvement in traditional soil fertility management practices and forest resource-based economic development opportunities for local people is needed to reduce the threat from agriculture to forest ecosystems.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Implications Of Urbanization For Urban Heat Islands In Beijing: A Predictive Approach Based On Ca–Markov Modeling (2004–2050)
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - The rapid increase in infrastructural development in populated areas has had numerous adverse impacts. The rise in land surface temperature (LST) and its associated damage to urban ecological systems result from urban development. Understanding the current and future LST phenomenon and its relationship to landscape composition and land use/cover (LUC) changes is critical to developing policies to mitigate the disastrous impacts of urban heat islands (UHIs) on urban ecosystems. Using remote sensing and GIS data, this study assessed the multi-scale relationship of LUCC and LST of the cosmopolitan exponentially growing area of Beijing, China. We investigated the impacts of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration for a time series (2004–2019) of Landsat data using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a single channel algorithm (SCA), respectively. We built a CA–Markov model to forecast future (2025 and 2050) LUCC and LST spatial patterns. Our results indicate that the cumulative changes in an urban area (UA) increased by about 908.15 km2 (5%), and 11% of vegetation area (VA) decreased from 2004 to 2019. The correlation coefficient of LUCC including vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas with LST had values of r = −0.155 (p > 0.419), −0.809 (p = 0.000), and 0.526 (p = 0.003), respectively. The results surrounding future forecasts revealed an estimated 2309.55 km2 (14%) decrease in vegetation (urban and forest), while an expansion of 1194.78 km2 (8%) was predicted for a built-up area from 2019 to 2050. This decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely cause a rise of about ~5.74◦ C to ~9.66◦ C in temperature. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that LST is directly related to the vegetation index. In conclusion, the estimated overall increase of 7.5◦ C in LST was predicted from 2019–2050, which is alarming for the urban community’s environmental health. The present results provide insight into sustainable environmental development through effective urban planning of Beijing and other urban hotspots. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Assessment Of Sentinel-2 To Monitor Highly Dynamic Small Water Bodies: The Case Of Louro Lagoon (Galicia, Nw Spain)
JO  - OCEANOLOGIA
PY  - 2022
AB  - Coastal lagoons have been providing ecological, economic and cultural benefits for many centuries. Despite their importance, the monitoring of coastal lagoons poses numerous challenges related to their complex environmental processes, their large variability in size and their remote location, inhibiting effective management programmes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 satellites to map highly dynamic morphological and hydrological changes in the Louro lagoon, a small choked lagoon located on the Galician coast (NW Spain). For this purpose, a simple methodology using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) has been evaluated, which allows to monitor the sand barrier changes and the inlet formation. The results show that the sand barrier's opening and closing might take only a very short period, and the recovery of the lagoon to its full water level can happen in less than a month. Sentinel-2 images also reveal drastic changes in the water level once the sand barrier is broken. A water surface area of 0.24 km(2) was estimated on 04/11/2019, while this surface was reduced to 0.10 km(2) on 04/12/2019. Monitoring these changes is critical to understand the different processes ongoing in these valuable environments and making informed decisions for their management and protection.

TI  - Sgrt-Based Dibh Radiotherapy Practice For Right-Sided Breast Cancer Combined With Rni: A Retrospective Study On Dosimetry And Setup Accuracy
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - BackgroundWe retrospectively studied the dosimetry and setup accuracy of deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) radiotherapy in right-sided breast cancer patients with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who had completed treatment based on surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT) technology by Sentinel/Catalyst system, aiming to clarify the clinical application value and related issues. MethodsDosimetric indicators of four organs at risk (OARs), namely the heart, right coronary artery (RCA), right lung, and liver, were compared on the premise that the planning target volume met dose-volume prescription requirements. Meanwhile, the patients were divided into the edge of the xiphoid process (EXP), sternum middle (SM), and left breast wall (LBW) groups according to different positions of respiratory gating primary points. The CBCT setup error data of the three groups were contrasted for the treatment accuracy study, and the effects of different gating window heights on the right lung volume increases were compared among the three groups. ResultsCompared with free breath (FB), DIBH reduced the maximum dose of heart and RCA by 739.3 +/- 571.2 cGy and 509.8 +/- 403.8 cGy, respectively (p < 0.05). The liver changed the most in terms of the mean dose (916.9 +/- 318.9 cGy to 281.2 +/- 150.3 cGy, p < 0.05). The setup error of the EXP group in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction was 3.6 +/- 4.5 mm, which is the highest among the three groups. The right lung volume increases in the EXP, SM, and LBW groups were 72.3\%, 69.9\%, and 67.2\%, respectively (p = 0.08), and the corresponding breath-holding heights were 13.5 +/- 3.7 mm, 10.3 +/- 2.4 mm, and 9.6 +/- 2.8 mm, respectively (p < 0.05). ConclusionsSGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy can better protect the four OARs of right-sided breast cancer patients with RNI. Different respiratory gating primary points have different setup accuracy and breath-hold height.

TI  - Soda Bottle Science—Citizen Science Monsoon Precipitation Monitoring In Nepal
JO  - Frontiers in Earth Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Citizen science, as a complement to ground-based and remotely-sensed precipitation measurements, is a promising approach for improving precipitation observations. During the 2018 monsoon (May to September), SmartPhones4Water (S4W) Nepal—a young researcher-led water monitoring network—partnered with 154 citizen scientists to generate 6,656 precipitation measurements in Nepal with low-cost (<1 USD) S4W gauges constructed from repurposed soda bottles, concrete, and rulers. Measurements were recorded with Android-based smartphones using Open Data Kit Collect and included GPS-generated coordinates, observation date and time, photographs, and observer-reported readings. A year-long S4W gauge intercomparison revealed a −2.9% error compared to the standard 203 mm (8-inch) gauge used by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Nepal. We analyzed three sources of S4W gauge errors: evaporation, concrete soaking, and condensation, which were 0.5 mm day−1 (n = 33), 0.8 mm (n = 99), and 0.3 mm (n = 49), respectively. We recruited citizen scientists by leveraging personal relationships, outreach programs at schools/colleges, social media, and random site visits. We motivated ongoing participation with personal follow-ups via SMS, phone, and site visit; bulk SMS; educational workshops; opportunities to use data; lucky draws; certificates of involvement; and in certain cases, payment. The average citizen scientist took 42 measurements (min = 1, max = 148, stdev = 39). Paid citizen scientists (n = 37) took significantly more measurements per week (i.e., 54) than volunteers (i.e., 39; alpha level = 0.01). By comparing actual values (determined by photographs) with citizen science observations, we identified three categories of observational errors (n = 592; 9% of total measurements): unit (n = 50; 8% of errors; readings in centimeters instead of millimeters); meniscus (n = 346; 58% of errors; readings of capillary rise), and unknown (n = 196; 33% of errors). A cost per observation analysis revealed that measurements could be performed for as little as 0.07 and 0.30 USD for volunteers and paid citizen scientists, respectively. Our results confirm that citizen science precipitation monitoring with low-cost gauges can help fill precipitation data gaps in Nepal and other data scarce regions. © 2019 Davids, Devkota, Pandey, Prajapati, Ertis, Rutten, Lyon, Bogaard and van de Giesen.

AB  - Background: The costs of cancer registration have previously been estimated for registries in the continental United States and many international registries; however, to date, there has been no economic assessment of population based registries in the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands. This study estimates the costs and factors affecting the operations of US-Affiliated Pacific Island population-based cancer registries. Methods: The web-based International Registry Costing Tool1 was used to collect costs, resources used, cancer cases processed, and other registry characteristics from the Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry (PRCCR), Federated States of Micronesia National Cancer Registry, and nine satellite jurisdictional registries within the US Pacific Islands. The registries provided data on costs for June 30, 2016–June 29, 2017, and cases processed during 2014. Results: Local host institutions provided a vital source of support for US Affiliated Pacific Islands registries, covering substantial fixed costs, such as management and overhead. The cost per cancer case processed had an almost tenfold variation across registries, with the average total cost per case of about $1,413. The average cost per inhabitant in the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands was about $1.77 per person. Discussion: The challenges of collecting data from dispersed populations spread across multiple islands of the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands are likely leading factors driving the magnitude of the registries’ cost per case. The economic information from this study provides a valuable source of activity based cost data that can both help guide cancer control initiatives and help registries improve operations and efficiency. © The Authors.

TI  - Assessment Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Loss Over The Upper Basin Of Miyun Reservoir In China Based On Rs And Gis Techniques
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2011
AB  - Soil conservation planning often requires estimates of the spatial distribution of soil erosion at a catchment or regional scale. This paper applied the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to investigate the spatial distribution of annual soil loss over the upper basin of Miyun reservoir in China. Among the soil erosion factors, which are rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length (L), slope steepness (S), vegetation cover (C), and support practice factor (P), the vegetative cover or C factor, which represents the effects of vegetation canopy and ground covers in reducing soil loss, has been one of the most difficult to estimate over broad geographic areas. In this paper, the C factor was estimated based on back propagation neural network and the results were compared with the values measured in the field. The correlation coefficient (r) obtained was 0.929. Then the C factor and the other factors were used as the input to RUSLE model. By integrating the six factor maps in geographical information system (GIS) through pixel-based computing, the spatial distribution of soil loss over the upper basin of Miyun reservoir was obtained. The results showed that the annual average soil loss for the upper basin of Miyun reservoir was 9.86 t ha (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) ya (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) in 2005, and the area of 46.61 km(2) (0.3\%) experiences extremely severe erosion risk, which needs suitable conservation measures to be adopted on a priority basis. The spatial distribution of erosion risk classes was 66.9\% very low, 21.89\% low, 6.18\% moderate, 2.89\% severe, and 1.84\% very severe. Thus, by using RUSLE in a GIS environment, the spatial distribution of water erosion can be obtained and the regions which susceptible to water erosion and need immediate soil conservation planning and application over the upper watershed of Miyun reservoir in China can be identified.

TI  - Bright Lights, Big City: Causal Effects Of Population And Gdp On Urban Brightness
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Cities are arguably both the cause, and answer, to societies’ current sustainability issues. Urbanization is the interplay between a city’s physical growth and its socio-economic development, both of which consume a substantial amount of energy and resources. Knowledge of the underlying driver(s) of urban expansion facilitates not only academic research but, more importantly, bridges the gap between science, policy drafting, and practical urban management. An increasing number of researchers are recognizing the benefits of innovative remotely sensed datasets, such as nighttime lights data (NTL), as a proxy to map urbanization and subsequently examine the driving socio-economic variables in cities. We further these approaches, by taking a trans-pacific view, and examine how an array of socio-economic ind0icators of 25 culturally and economically important urban hubs relate to long term patterns in NTL for the past 21 years. We undertake a classic econometric approach—panel causality tests which allow analysis of the causal relationships between NTL and socio-economic development across the region. The panel causality test results show a contrasting effect of population and gross domestic product (GDP) on NTL in fast, and slowly, changing cities. Information derived from this study quantitatively chronicles urban activities in the pan-Pacific region and potentially offers data for studies that spatially track local progress of sustainable urban development goals. © 2018 Lu, Coops.

TI  - The Software Strategy For Spa Plug And Play Spacecraft
PY  - 2010
AB  - The space market could benefit immensely from satellites that not only start their service lives as soon as possible, but can perform their on-orbit roles with minimal intervention from ground operations. 1 2 The development of flight software techniques that addresses both of these issues has been ongoing at the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) Responsive Space Testbed (RST) for a number of years. The Space Plug\&play Avionics (SPA) standards define the means by which software (and hardware) components installed on a networked spacecraft bus deliver their data interfaces and self-organize into a coherent, functional system. A collection of modular, pre-validated software applications are maintained in a "virtual store room" and are called upon to configure tailored mission capabilities based upon operational needs. Mission "Activity Agents" encapsulate the logic and sequences necessary to accomplish satellite operations autonomously. Their execution is coordinated using on-orbit planning resources and a priority-based scheduler. The PnPSat mission was the first formal application of these techniques. In the course of the program a spectrum of software tools were authored to support the rapid design, prototyping, and testing of flight software modules for SPA-based satellites. The AFRL Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) assembly depot is being populated with an assortment of hardware and software components sufficient to build a reasonably diverse array of tactical small satellites. The tools being used, and the philosophies employed in their application, are ready for exposure to the larger space community.

TI  - Spatial Distribution Of Natural Hazards And Their Proximity To Heritage Sites: Case Of The United Arab Emirates
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
PY  - 2022
AB  - The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) investigated World Heritage sites and listed some in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Heritage sites in any country have important cultural and economic value. However, many of the sites are subjected to potential impact by natural hazards, considering their age and the effects of climate. In the interest of reducing these impacts, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and the World Heritage Committee called for a detailed hazard assessment. This research falls within this assessment scope by applying remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to assess the spatial distribution of natural hazards and their proximity to heritage sites in the UAE. Results show that heritage sites in the northeastern UAE are more vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, and sea-level rise. Still, risk varies depending on elevation and the proximity to fault lines and the coastline. In the western UAE, the majority of heritage sites are prone to the effects of desertification and sand encroachment. This study is large-scale in nature, and specific vulnerability assessments for each heritage site are beyond the scope of this paper. The database, methodology, and output from this research could be useful for many organizations, such as those working in the fields of culture and heritage, tourism, disaster management, and urban planning. Compilation of a GIS database centering upon the heritage sites in the UAE is considered a major step forward for future studies related to the sites. The GIS database is available for interested users upon request.

TI  - Seasonal Habitat Patterns Of Jumbo Flying Squid Dosidicus Gigas Off Peruvian Waters
JO  - Journal of Marine Systems
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat modeling approach is a useful tool to detect potential habitat of pelagic fish species for better fishery exploitation and management. In this study, an integrated habitat modeling approach was applied to examine seasonal habitat patterns of an ecologically and economically important squid species Dosidicus gigas in the Southeast Pacific Ocean off Peruvian waters. Fisheries data of D. gigas and three crucial remotely-sensed environmental variables including sea surface temperature (SST), net primary production (NPP) and sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) during 2006–2015 were used to develop and validate the habitat model. Results revealed that the model output robust predictions of seasonal habitat suitability for D. gigas stock. Potential habitat exhibited strong seasonal variability, characterized by an expansion of suitable habitat during spring-autumn period and an extreme reduction in winter. These seasonal habitat patterns of D. gigas were largely driven by spatial distribution of favorable environmental conditions. Spatial correlation analysis indicated that the habitat quality of D. gigas was negatively correlated with SST in the areas between 8°–15°S and 87°–79°W and with SSHA on the whole fishing ground. However, a negative relationship was found between HSI values and NPP in the east of 84°W, but with a significantly positive correlation in the west of 84°W. In addition, seasonal variations of CPUEs and latitude distribution of fishing efforts were highly coincided with the variability trends in the area of suitable habitats and their latitudinal distributions. Interannual variability was shown in the averaged HSI of D. gigas. Furthermore, comparing to the strong El Niño year in 2015, the La Niña event in 2011 yielded more enlarged favorable regions of each environmental factor in each season, leading to form extremely high-quality habitats. © 2019

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics And Environmental Controlling Factors Of The Lake Tana Water Hyacinth In Ethiopia
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - The largest freshwater lake in Ethiopia, Lake Tana, has faced ecological disaster due to water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) infestation. The water hyacinth is a threat not only to the ecology but also to the socioeconomic development of the region and cultural value of the lake, which is registered as a UNESCO reserve. This study aims to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water hyacinth using high-resolution PlanetScope satellite images and assesses the major environmental variables that relate to the weed spatial coverage dynamics for the period August 2017 to July 2018. The plausible environmental factors studied affecting the weed dynamics include lake level, water and air temperature, and turbidity. Water temperature and turbidity were estimated from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite image and the water level was estimated using Jason-1 altimetry data while the air temperature was obtained from the nearby meteorological station at Bahir Dar station. The results indicated that water hyacinth coverage was increasing at a rate of 14 ha/day from August to November of 2017. On the other hand, the coverage reduced at a rate of 6 ha/day from December 2017 to June 2018. However, the length of shoreline infestation increased significantly from 4.3 km in August 2017 to 23.4 km in April 2018. Lake level and night-time water temperatures were strongly correlated with water hyacinth spatial coverage (p< 0.05). A drop in the lake water level resulted in a considerable reduction of the infested area, which is also related to decreasing nutrient levels in the water. The water hyacinth expansion dynamics could be altered by treating the nutrient-rich runoff with best management practices along the wetland and in the lake watershed landscape.

TI  - Identifying Critical Leo Kinetic Space Safety Activities
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2022
AB  - Companies and organizations have proposed best practices for space safety, policymakers are emphasizing the importance of space sustainability, regulators are re-examining satellite licensing conditions, and many member states of the UN COPUOS have endorsed guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. In parallel, these organizations and others are engaging in a healthy conversation on the magnitude of the issue, developing proposals for near- and long-term solutions and addressing the challenges of gaining widespread acceptance. Space safety and sustainability have galvanized stakeholder communities, but specific, meaningful solutions remain largely elusive, despite frequent webinars and conferences dedicated to the issue. The authors gathered to examine specific solutions and pragmatic actions to enhance LEO kinetic space safety (i.e., all measures to minimize collision risk for current and future space systems). A forcing function for this paper was the LEO Kinetic Space Safety Workshop held in May 2022 in Lausanne, Switzerland. This event scrutinized individual space safety activities by benefit (positive outcomes for space safety), maturity (readiness of the solution for implementation), and cost (resources required to develop and implement a solution). However, while the authors used this event as a starting point for discussions, we were clearly focused on creating a forward-leaning position paper with specific recommendations for the priority of kinetic space safety activities. This paper focuses on communicating to operators, developers, space agencies, regulators, academia, and others to advance toward a safer LEO environment. It is hoped that this document will serve as a roadmap for prioritizing kinetic space safety activities by the global space community. Copyright © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation.

TI  - Flash Floods, Land-Use Change, And Risk Dynamics In Mountainous Tourist Areas: A Case Study Of The Yesanpo Scenic Area, Beijing, China
JO  - International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction
PY  - 2020
AB  - Flash floods have caused significant property damage in many mountainous tourist areas around the world. Focussing on the Yesanpo Scenic Area with more than 4.5 million visitors each year and annual tourism revenue of 150 million yuan, flood risk modelling was undertaken using HEC-HMS and FlO-2D. Three flood scenarios (a real event that occurred in 2012, a hypothetical flood in 2017, and a future flood scenario) were evaluated using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. The results show that from 2012 to 2017, due to the development of tourism and changes in land-use in the area, the flash flood risk increased by 28%. During this six-year period, most of the agricultural land surrounding the Juma River has been changed to tourist use and the land value has increased by 38%. Based on an inundation depth of 0.5 m, land value losses are expected in the order of 104 yuan m−2 for business use land and 0.8 yuan m−2 for agricultural land. Relative to the baseline flood scenario, the flood risk in three studied villages is expected to increase significantly by 103% under the modelled future scenario. Even where disasters have been experienced, risks are often ignored in tourist areas because tourism in these areas can generate high revenue. Our findings provide important new information for tourism planners facing the long-term effects of flash floods. Sustainable planning decisions and flood control measures are required in these mountainous areas that do not affect the amenity value of the natural landscape. © 2020

TI  - App-Based Versus Standard Six-Minute Walk Test In Pulmonary Hypertension: Mixed Methods Study
JO  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease of the pulmonary vasculature that can lead to heart failure and premature death. Assessment of patients with PAH includes performing a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in clinics. We developed a smartphone app to compute the walked distance (6MWD) indoors, by counting U-turns, and outdoors, by using satellite positioning. Objective: The goal of the research was to assess (1) accuracy of the indoor 6MWTs in clinical settings, (2) validity and test-retest reliability of outdoor 6MWTs in the community, (3) compliance, usability, and acceptance of the app, and (4) feasibility of pulse oximetry during 6MWTs. Methods: We tested the app on 30 PAH patients over 6 months. Patients were asked to perform 3 conventional 6MWTs in clinic while using the app in the indoor mode and one or more app-based 6MWTs in outdoor mode in the community per month. Results: Bland-Altman analysis of 70 pairs of conventional versus app-based indoor 6MWDs suggests that the app is sometimes inaccurate (14.6 m mean difference, lower and upper limit of agreement: -133.35 m to 162.55 m). The comparison of 69 pairs of conventional 6MWDs and community-based outdoor 6MWDs within 7 days shows that community tests are strongly related to those performed in clinic (correlation 0.89), but the interpretation of the distance should consider that differences above the clinically significant threshold are not uncommon. Analysis of 89 pairs of outdoor tests performed by the same patient within 7 days shows that community-based tests are repeatable (intraclass correlation 0.91, standard error of measurement 36.97 m, mean coefficient of variation 12.45\%). Questionnaires and semistructured interviews indicate that the app is usable and well accepted, but motivation to use it could be affected if the data are not used for clinical decision, which may explain low compliance in 52\% of our cohort. Analysis of pulse oximetry data indicates that conventional pulse oximeters are unreliable if used during a walk. Conclusions: App-based outdoor 6MWTs in community settings are valid, repeatable, and well accepted by patients. More studies would be needed to assess the benefits of using the app in clinical practice.

TI  - Economic Feasibility Study For Pavement Monitoring Using Synthetic Aperture Radar-Based Satellite Remote Sensing Cost-Benefit Analysis
JO  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
PY  - 2017
AB  - Recent developments in satellite remote sensing and the availability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) products have created an opportunity for the use of SAR-based monitoring for pavement and infrastructure management. No previous studies have performed a detailed cost-benefit analysis to analyze the economic feasibility of pavement monitoring through the use of SAR-based satellite remote sensing. The aim of this study was to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a comprehensive methodology to estimate the most important benefits and expenses associated with the use of data obtained from satellites by SAR and interferometric SAR for advanced monitoring of the infrastructure and to gain a better understanding of the strategies used to identify their effects. A general cost-benefit analysis framework that could serve as a pavement management tool for assessment of pavement deformations and deformation velocities with millimeter accuracy was developed. The results of a case study performed in the state of Delaware to demonstrate how the proposed approaches can be used to assess the impacts of SAR-based monitoring projects are also presented.

TI  - Modeling Fire Susceptibility To Delineate Wildland-Urban Interface For Municipal-Scale Fire Risk Management
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2013
AB  - The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is the region where development meets and intermingles with wildlands. The WUI has an elevated fire risk due to the proximity of development and residents to wildlands with natural wildfire regimes. Existing methods of delineating WUI are typically applied over a large region, use proxies for risk, and do not consider site-specific fire hazard drivers. While these models are appropriate for federal and provincial risk management, municipal managers require models intended for smaller regions. The model developed here uses the Burn-P3 fire behavior model to model WUI from local fire susceptibility (FS) in two study communities. Forest fuel code (FFC) maps for the study communities were modified using remote sensing data to produce detailed forest edges, including ladder fuels, update data currency, and add buildings and roads. The modified FFC maps used in Burn-P3 produced bimodal FS distributions for each community. The WUI in these communities was delineated as areas within community bounds where FS was greater than or equal to -1 SD from the mean FS value (), which fell in the trough of the bimodal distribution. The WUI so delineated conformed to the definition of WUI. This model extends WUI modeling for broader risk management initiatives for municipal management of risk, as it (a) considers site-specific drivers of fire behavior; (b) models risk, represented by WUI, specific to a community; and, (c) does not use proxies for risk.

TI  - Mapping And Analyzing Temporal Variability Of Spectral Indices In The Lowland Region Of Far Western Nepal
JO  - Water Practice and Technology
PY  - 2023
AB  - Satellite imagery-based spectral indices are essential for monitoring natural resource changes and urban environments. Assessing these indices is vital for natural resource management and environmental sustainability. This study adopted geospatial techniques and satellite imagery (Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS) to analyze changes in key spectral indices, i.e. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) over the past three decades (1991–2022) in the low land region of Far Western Nepal. The study examined the temporal trends and intricate relationships between these indices during this time frame. The substantial changes in NDVI, NDBI, and NDWI within the study area have been quantified from 1991 to 2022. The findings revealed significantly elevated NDBI values in 1991, 2001, and 2013 compared to 2022, while NDWI and NDVI values were consistently lower in 1991,2001, and 2013 compared to 2022. Notably, a negative correlation was observed between NDVI and both NDBI and NDWI, contrasting with the positive correlation found between NDBI and NDWI. The study underscores the potential of combining these spectral indices to evaluate vegetated areas, built-up areas, and water bodies, providing valuable insights for effective land manage-ment, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and sustainable water resource management. © 2023 The Author.

TI  - Cost And Benefit Of Satellite Shielding
JO  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
PY  - 2008
AB  - Recent simulations of the future development of the space debris environment revealed that the number of hypervelocity impacts on satellite surfaces will increase. Impacts of space debris particles and micrometeoroids can damage satellites. This can cause operational anomalies or even the loss of a satellite mission. The loss of a satellite reduces its expected operational lifetime. Thus, financial investments cannot be amortized completely. In this paper the cost of hypervelocity impacts on satellites is estimated. A risk analysis is performed by combining the probability of a penetration with the failure probability of the satellite. The goal of this work is to combine the risk of particle impacts with a cost analysis. The probability of a satellite failure is estimated by combining the probability of a penetration with a vulnerability model. The failure probability is weighted with the mission cost of a satellite. This results in a probability of loss of amortization. The amortization loss is used as estimation for the damage cost due to hypervelocity impacts. In this way it is possible to associate impacts with cost. The cost model is used to analyze selected reference missions. This analysis considers the influence of shielding measures on the mission cost. An important result is the estimation of the failure probability for different satellite wall designs including shielding. Shielding requires a modification of the satellite wall. This can result in an increasing complexity of the wall or an increasing mass. As a consequence, the hardware cost increase. To identify suitable shielding measures and to justify the additional financial investments, it is necessary to investigate the economic feasibility of such measures and to demonstrate their benefit.

TI  - Mortality, Migration, And Rural Transformation In Sub-Saharan Africa's Urban Transition
JO  - Journal of Demographic Economics
PY  - 2017
AB  - The stylized facts of Africa's urban transition highlight the limitations of traditional economic models of urbanization. Recent research has provided evidence that demographic rather than economic processes provide a more compelling explanation for observed trends in the region. In particular, mortality decline appears to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for urbanization to occur and a key driver of urban growth more broadly. The accumulation of survey data over the past few decades and the development of new geospatial datasets that incorporate satellite imagery are facilitating new, more spatially nuanced insights into the dynamics of urban population change in the region. This offers opportunity to develop better policies for managing urban change than those adopted in the past, which placed a misguided emphasis on manipulating migration incentives with little evidence of positive benefits.

TI  - Positron Emission Tomography (Pet) And Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Mri) For The Assessment Of Axillary Lymph Node Metastases In Early Breast Cancer: Systematic Review And Economic Evaluation
JO  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Evaluation of axillary lymph node metastases is important for breast cancer staging and treatment planning. Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, cost-effectiveness and effect on patient outcomes of positron emission tomography (PET), with or without computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of axillary lymph node metastases in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer. Data sources: A systematic review of literature and an economic evaluation were carried out. Key databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and nine others) plus research registers and conference proceedings were searched for relevant studies up to April 2009. A decision-analytical model was developed to determine cost-effectiveness in the UK. Review methods: One reviewer assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, obtained the full text of relevant papers and screened them against inclusion criteria. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer using a standardised data extraction form and checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Quality of included studies was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) checklist, applied by one reviewer and checked by a second. Results: Forty-five citations relating to 35 studies were included in the clinical effectiveness review: 26 studies of PET and nine studies of MRI. Two studies were included in the cost-effectiveness review: one of PET and one of MRI. Of the seven studies evaluating PET/CT (n=862), the mean sensitivity was 56\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 44\% to 67\%] and mean specificity 96\% (95\% CI 90\% to 99\%). Of the 19 studies evaluating PET only (n=1729), the mean sensitivity was 66\% (95\% CI 50\% to 79\%) and mean specificity 93\% (95\% CI 89\% to 96\%). PET performed less well for small metastases; the mean sensitivity was 11\% (95\% CI 5\% to 22\%) for micrometastases (<= 2 mm; five studies; n=63), and 57\% (95\% CI 47\% to 66\%) for macrometastases (>2 mm; four :studies; n=111). The smallest metastatic nodes detected by PET measured 3 mm, while PET failed to detect some nodes measuring >15 mm. Studies in which all patients were clinically node negative showed a trend towards lower sensitivity of PET compared with studies with a mixed population. Across five studies evaluating ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced MRI (n=93), the mean sensitivity was 98\% (95\% CI 61\% to 100\%) and mean specificity 96\% (95\% CI 72\% to 100\%). Across three studies of gadolinium-enhanced MRI (n=187), the mean sensitivity was 88\% (95\% CI 78\% to 94\%) and mean specificity 73\% (95\% CI 63\% to 81\%). In the single study of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (n=27), the sensitivity was 65\% (95\% CI 38\% to 86\%) and specificity 100\% (95\% CI 69\% to 100\%). USPIO-enhanced MRI showed a trend towards higher sensitivity and specificity than gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Results of the decision modelling suggest that the MRI replacement strategy is the most cost-effective strategy and dominates the baseline 4-node sampling (4-NS) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) strategies in most sensitivity analyses undertaken. The PET replacement strategy is not as robust as the MRI replacement strategy, as its cost-effectiveness is significantly affected by the utility decrement for lymphoedema and the probability of relapse for false-negative (FN) patients. Limitations: No included studies directly compared PET and MRI. Conclusions: Studies demonstrated that PET and MRI have lower sensitivity and specificity than SLNB and 4-NS but are associated with fewer adverse events. Included studies indicated a significantly higher mean sensitivity for MRI than for PET, with USPIO-enhanced MRI providing the highest sensitivity. However, sensitivity and specificity of PET and MRI varied widely between studies, and MRI studies were relatively small and varied in their methods; therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Decision modelling based on these results suggests that the most cost-effective strategy may be MRI rather than SLNB or 4-NS. This strategy reduces costs and increases quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) because there are fewer adverse events for the majority of patients. However, this strategy leads to more FN cases at higher risk of cancer recurrence and more false-positive (FP) cases who would undergo unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection. Adding MRI prior to SLNB or 4-NS has little effect on QALYs, though this analysis is limited by lack of available data. Future research should include large, well-conducted studies of MRI, particularly using USPIO; data on the long-term impacts of lymphoedema on cost and patient utility; studies of the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SLNB and 4-NS; and more robust UK cost data for 4-NS and SLNB as well as the cost of MRI and PET techniques. Funding: This study was funded by the Health Technology Assessment programme of the National Institute of Health Research.

TI  - Spatial-Social Evaluations Of Ecosystem Services Of Adaptive Aquaculture Models Using Sar And Multivariate Analyses: A Case In The Vietnamese Mekong Delta
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2022
AB  - The presented study is conducted to investigate the efficiency of two important aquaculture models of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD)’s Soc Trang province via quantifying and mapping the supporting ecosystem services (ES). The study targets the two most prevalent rearing practices, intensive and semi-intensive, covering four rural districts: My Xuyen, Tran De, Cu Lao Dung, and Vinh Chau. A mixed-method approach was applied, combining remote sensing, grass-root social survey, and multivariate statistical analyses. First, image analysis using Sentinel-1A time-series data was conducted to detect the aquaculture areas across the study area based on temporal changes of VV backscatter of different land use/land cover (LULC) types, in which aquaculture receives relatively low backscatter values compared to other LULC categories except river and deeper water surfaces. Our analysis yields an overall accuracy of 91% with a kappa coefficient of 0.82. Second, using semi-structured questionnaires, a total of 140 shrimp farming households across the four focused districts were interviewed for their rearing experience. Thereupon, the collected responses were analyzed using two multivariate analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). In general, the intensive model could have generated more economic values of ecosystem services than the artisanal/semi-intensive model. Our analyses also took note of the potential barriers hindering the semi-intensive farmers from achieving higher economic income. These include (i) geographical factors, i.e., locations; (ii) social factors, i.e., experience, farming calendar, education; (iii) financial factors, i.e., investments; and (iv) technical factors, i.e., farm areas, productivity, rearing concentration. Since semi-intensive food is more appropriate for small-scale farming households, it is recommendable that addressing these factors can enhance the efficiency of this model as a profitable livelihood option. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Monitoring Soil–Plant Interactions And Maize Yield By Satellite Vegetation Indexes, Soil Electrical Conductivity And Management Zones
JO  - Precision Agriculture
PY  - 2023
AB  - In modern agriculture, understanding the spatio-temporal variability in crop fields and the implications of environmental factors in soil management are important for sustainable practices. In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield. Finally, the MZs derived from spectral data could define yield-limiting zones inside the crop field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Dynamical Fusion Model With Joint Variational And Deep Priors For Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
JO  - IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters
PY  - 2023
AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel dynamic fusion model (DFM) with joint variational and deep priors for the task of hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR). The given model can benefit from both the advantages of traditional modeling and deep learning (DL) methods, thus achieving significant improvements based on existing deep pretrained models. Specifically, the given model mainly contains two newly designed terms, i.e., the weighted spatial fidelity (WSF) term and the deep fusion (DF) term. The WSF term focuses on the spatial recovery of the low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) through the high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) without the knowledge of the spectral response matrix, thus the proposed DFM can be viewed as a semi-blind model for HISR. Moreover, the DF term relied upon DF with a designed adaptive weight matrix, which can effectively inject the deep priors into the traditional minimization model. Besides, the proposed DFM can be quickly and effectively solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art HISR methods. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Forest Tree Species Classification Using Machine Learning And Satellite Images
JO  - 2023 International Conference on Earth Observation and Geo-Spatial Information, ICEOGI 2023
PY  - 2023
AB  - Forests play a vital role in our ability to thrive, and their significance in our lives cannot be overstated. In forestry, machine learning has found diverse applications, with tree species classification being one of the most significant. This task involves categorising trees into groups, such as genera or families, and can greatly benefit from the utilisation of Remote Sensing (RS) images, which allow for remote assessment of forest conditions and facilitate effective forest management. The objective of this paper was to classify forest tree species using remote sensing images acquired from the Sentinel-2 satellite and Vegetation Indices (VIs). Three VIs were calculated: the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). Subsequently, three major machine learning classification algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, were selected for the classification task. The performance of these algorithms was compared using four evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F-score, and accuracy. The results revealed that Random Forest outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 0.76, precision of 0.71, recall of 0.72, and F-score of 0.71. This research contributes to the advancement of tree species classification using remote sensing images and machine learning techniques, with potential applications in forest management and conservation. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Oil Slope Index: An Algorithm For Crude Oil Spill Detection With Imaging Spectroscopy
JO  - Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications, EORSA 2012
PY  - 2012
AB  - Marine oil spill is a major threat to marine and coastal ecosystems and is seen relatively often, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and Bohai Sea oil spills in China in 2011. Fast and accurate discrimination of oil spill is the largest challenge in detection of oil spills using remote sensing technology. In this research imaging spectroscopic analysis and Oil Slope Index(OSI) were developed to map the locations of surface crude oil in Gulf of Mexico using the SpecTIR data which was collected at 2.2m GSD and 360 spectral channels, covering 390-2450nm. The spectral features and differences of the main objects of oil, sea water and clouds can be found in the DN value of pixel spectra. The slope difference in the range from 550nm to 750nm between crude oil and other objects can be taken as a key feature for detection of crude oil on the sea surface. The Oil Slope Index(OSI) avoids the absorption bands of O 2 and H 2O in the air and transforms the imaging spectroscopy data into a single band image that shows the distribution of crude oil spill. OSI values can be easily calculated from radiance or DN data and no additional pre-processing of the imagery was necessary before crude oil detection. The result shows that the algorithms work well for oil spill detection which integrated the spectral feature of oil, sea water and clouds by establishing a decision tree. The automatic determination of thresholds by applying Otsu's image segmentation can realize the fast and automatic extraction of surface crude oil. This study demonstrated that the Oil Slope Index (OSI) has the potential to become a useful image processing algorithm and operational tool for imaging spectroscopy detection of crude oil spill. © 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Promoting The Use Of Meteosat For Supporting Sustainable Development In Africa
PY  - 1997
AB  - The present Meteosat satellite system, although primarily designed to serve the meteorological needs of Europe, actually provides operational geostationary coverage over the whole African continent. Four major kinds of services are made available to African countries through the Meteosat System: visible and infrared cloud imagery, collection and dissemination of ground generated observation data, dissemination of meteorological forecasts elaborated in European and African centres, and products derived from the imagery, such as rainfall estimates from Cloud Cold Duration data. The above services are considered in Africa as an essential support for a number of applications including operational meteorology, water resources management, disaster early warning and desertification monitoring. However developing countries are still far from using all the capabilities of the system, and a limited well-focused effort will help them to take a much larger benefit out of the existing and future satellites. This cooperation is expected to enable the African centres to play their full role within the world meteorological community. In close consultation with the African users EUMETSAT has identified the following priorities: to enhance interaction with the user community at a regional level, to ensure that data and services are affordable, to support user training, and to facilitate technical access to the data. Practical achievements are reported below. The relationship established between the satellite operator - EUMETSAT - and the regional user community is highlighted as a key element in the success of these actions. Developing strong relationships with selected subregional centres also contributes to the process of local capacity building. EUMETSAT intends to work along these lines with its African partners and to coordinate its efforts with aid agencies whose objectives in this area may be complementary to those of EUMETSAT.

TI  - An Assessment Of Plant Based Natural Resources In The Okavango Region, Botswana Using Satellite Imagery
JO  - Rural Livelihoods, Risk and Political Economy of Access to Natural Resources in the Okavango Delta, Botswana
PY  - 2011
AB  - This chapter uses two different satellite imagery platforms, SPOT and Landsat, to map natural resource areas around the Okavango Delta. The areas surrounding three villages, each with different resources and land uses, were studied.. As a result of the growing human population and the expanding tourism sector, there is an increasing process of commoditisation and "privatisation" of the land and natural resources in Botswana. This has the potential to put pressure on natural resources and lead to their scarcity. In the cyclical flood pulse system of the Okavango Delta's wetlands, this is of particular concern, because intra- and inter-annual variation in water levels changes the availability of key natural resources, while the demand for them is growing steadily. Sustainable use in the face of rapid change in such a highly dynamic environment can only be achieved through sound management based on regular monitoring of conditions. The new(er) generations of satellite imagery hold much promise with respect to the more detailed mapping of vegetation cover, from which plant-based resources might be derived. This work involved an assessment of dry season SPOT 5 XS and wet season Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery in terms of their relative value for plant based natural resource mapping around specific candidate villages in the Okavango region. The finer spatial resolution of the SPOT imagery helped in the discrimination of detailed land uses in the vicinity of the villages which assists in the translation of the data for use by local communities. However the greater spectral range of Landsat makes it much better at discriminating different vegetation types and therefore in mapping specific plant-based natural resource areas Given cost considerations, this further strengthens the suitability of Landsat to developing country conditions. While the satellite-based maps of the resource distributions are unable to identify the exact location and extent of harvestable resource areas, they do identify habitat types for establishing monitoring zones on which ground-based monitoring and management strategies can be based. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Research On The Boundary Delimitation Method Of National Park Based On Cultural Service Protection
JO  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
PY  - 2022
AB  - China is in the process of establishing and improving the national park system and carrying out pilot projects. With China's vast territory and diverse ecological systems, appropriate delimitation of the boundaries of national parks is a key scientific issue in the construction of the national park system. Guidelines for the establishment of national parks attach great importance to its cultural service functions such as scientific research, education and public recreation. It is of practical significance to consider the cultural service values of ecosystems when exploring the boundary delimitation methods used to delineate national parks. Based on remote sensing images and network big data resources, this paper selects the Guangdong-Hong Kong- Macao Greater Bay Area as the study area and evaluates the value of ecosystem cultural services in this area. From the perspective of cultural service protection, this paper simulates a variety of scenarios and determines the optimal boundaries through comparative analysis, taking the risk of decision-making into consideration. The principal findings are as follows. (1) Cultural service value varies greatly among regions. (2) Considering the risk and balance of decision-making, seven risk coefficients (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1) between 0 and 1 were considered, and this analysis generated seven scenarios for national park boundaries. (3) Scenario 5 is the most favourable, with cultural, recreational, biodiversity, recuperative and aesthetic cultural efficiency values of 1.292, 1.520, 1.469, 1.543 and 1.430 respectively. This study provides a novel approach for the delineation of national park boundaries, and serves as a reference for regional development planning.

TI  - Not All Who Wander Are Lost: Improving Spatial Protection For Large Pelagic Fishes
JO  - MARINE POLICY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Spatial protection measures have become ubiquitous in fisheries management and marine conservation. Implemented for diverse objectives from stock rebuilding to biodiversity protection and ecosystem management, spatial measures range from temporary fisheries closures to marine protected areas with varying levels of protection. Ecological and economic benefits from spatial protection have been demonstrated for many reef and demersal species, but remain debated and understudied for highly migratory fishes, such as tunas, billfishes, and pelagic sharks. Here we summarize the spatial extent of fisheries closures implemented by the tuna RFMOs as well as marine protected areas worldwide, which together cover similar to 15\% of global ocean area. We furthermore synthesize results from modeling and tagging studies as well as fisheries-dependent research to provide an overview of the efficacy and benefits of present spatial protection measures for large pelagic fishes and their associated fisheries. We conclude that (1) many species with known migration routes, aggregating behavior, and philopatry can benefit from spatial protection; but (2) spatial protection alone is insufficient and should be integrated with effective fisheries management to protect and rebuild stocks of highly migratory species. We suggest tailoring spatial protection to the biology of large pelagic fishes, including improved protection for aggregation sites and migration corridors. These features currently appear to be an important-yet overlooked- opportunity to safeguard depleted and recovering stocks and protect pelagic biodiversity. New remote-sensing tools that track pelagic fishes and fishing vessels may provide timely support for improved spatial management in waters that were previously difficult to observe.

TI  - Fusion Of Lidar And Radar Data For Land-Cover Mapping In Natural Environments
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2015
AB  - Land-cover geodatabases are key products for the understanding of environmental systems and for setting up national and international prevention and protection policies. However, their automatic generation and update remain complicated with high accuracy over large scales. In natural environments, most of the existing solutions are semi-automatic in order to achieve a suitable discrimation of the large number of forest and crop classes. A large amount of remote sensing possibilities is at the moment available and data fusion appears to be the most suitable solution for that purpose. The paper tackles the issue of land-cover mapping in such areas assuming the existence of a partly non-updated 5-class geodatabase: buildings, roads, water, crops, forests. Lidar point clouds and Radar images at two spatial resolutions and bands are merged at the feature level and fed into an efficient supervised classification framework. Results show that some classes benefit from the joint exploitation of multiple observations in terms of accuracy or recall. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Modeling Stem And Branch Biomass Of Tamarix Spp. In The Marine Protected Area In Changyi, China
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2016
AB  - Tamarix spp. are woody plants that are widely distributed throughout the world, and they have ecological importance in the arid and salinized areas of China. However, methods for modeling the biomass of Tamarix spp. and other multi-stemmed shrubs are inadequate. Diameter measurements (such as diameter at breast height) are frequently used and have proved to correlate well with biomass; however, such methods are difficult to apply for Tamarix because of its irregular growth patterns and multiple stems. Modeling shrub biomass has received more attention in recent years, and several studies have indicated that for shrubs shaped like cylinders or cones, the crown area was significantly correlated with shrub biomass. Considering the constraints of diameter measurements for Tamarix spp., we modeled Tamarix spp. biomass using crown width and height in Changyi Marine Protected Area (Shandong Province, China; 37°06'15"N, 119°22'00"E). The area containing Tamarix spp. (T. chinensis and T. austromongolica) was approximately 20.7 km2. In February 2014, nine sample plots (30 m × 30 m) were selected, and three embedded plots (5 m × 5 m) were placed randomly in each plot. Prior to harvesting, the height (H), basal diameter (BD), and crown area (C) of 247 Tamarix individuals in the embedded plots were measured. Fresh weights (FW) were collected after harvesting. At the time of sampling, the trees had no foliage, and thus the FW included only stems and branches. One hundred and eighty-nine individuals were selected randomly to establish the regression equations, while the remaining 58 individuals were used for testing the accuracy of these equations. CH (the product of C×H) and C were chosen as independent variables, and the regression equations were established in the form of linear, power-law, and quadratic polynomials.The equations based on CH were FW=0.856 × (CH)－0.879 (R2= 0.884, F = 1428.5), FW=0.403 ×(CH)1.226 (R2= 0.900, F = 1396.1), and FW=0.010 × (CH)2+0.562 × (CH)+0.114(R2= 0.903, F = 875.7), whereas the equations based on C were FW=2.462 × C-1.893 (R2= 0.825, F = 881.8), FW=0.900 × C1.440 (R2= 0.861, F = 966.3), and FW=0.144 × C2+1.007 × C+0.127(R2= 0.864, F = 600.7). Although quadratic polynomial equations had higher R2values, the power-law functions performed best in the test, as they had deviations of -2.22% (CH) and 2.92% (C). Furthermore, because the power-law function is the most widely used allometric equation, we recommend establishing regression equations using power-law functions in this area. As tree crown properties can be reconstructed using high-resolution satellite data, allometric equations that use C as the only independent variable may provide a more cost-efficient way of monitoring, reporting, and verifying the carbon stocks of Tamarix spp. The mean values of H, BD, C, and FW in the study area were (215.2 ± 41.4)cm, (4.2 ± 1.9)cm, (2.49 ± 2.21)m2, and (4.15 ± 5.80)kg (mean ± SD), respectively; therefore, artificial management should be enhanced to improve the stand quality. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - The Association Between Charlson Comorbidity Index And Mortality In Acute Coronary Syndrome–The Maddec Study
JO  - Scandinavian Cardiovascular Journal
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with high mortality. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was designed over 30 years ago to measure the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on long-term survival of the patient. We wanted to re-evaluate the performance of CCI and its components in modern setting. Design. This is a retrospective study of 1576 consecutive patients undergoing invasive evaluation and treated for ACS in single tertiary center between 2015–2016. Mortality was analyzed in timeframes of 1, 6 and 24 months. CCI-scores were retrieved from written medical records and complimented with data from electronic sources. The performance of CCI and its components was compared to the GRACE-score measuring patients’ status upon hospital admission. Results. Population mean age at baseline was 69.3 (SD 11.8) years and 69.1% of the patients were male (n = 1089). Most of the components of CCI associated significantly with mortality at all timeframes despite adjusting for age but only diabetes and congestive heart failure associated with mortality at all time points after adjusting for GRACE-score. CCI associated with mortality [GRACE adjusted HR-values of single unit increase of CCI after 1, 6 and 24-month follow-up: 1.12(95% CI:1.00–1.25), 1.17(1.07–1.29) and 1.24(1.16–1.33)]. CCI performed modestly with its AUC-values ranging between 0.755 and 0.784, with prognostic performance increasing with longer follow-up. Adding components of CCI did not significantly improve risk prediction over GRACE-score. Conclusions. In conclusion, CCI or its individual components measuring the impact of comorbidities on overall mortality does not provide any significant value compared to GRACE–score during up to 2 years of follow-up. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Environmental Racism And Air Pollution: Pre And Post The Covid-19 Economic Shutdown
JO  - Review of Policy Research
PY  - 2023
AB  - Decades of research demonstrates that minoritized groups are disproportionately affected by swathes of harmful pollutants, including air pollution, even controlling for low income. Would significantly reducing individual car traffic help reduce the EJ gap? The systemic shock of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, with accompanied reduction in car use, can be exploited to analyze this question. Kerr and colleagues ask this question for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), use satellite data and categorical differences, and find that majority-minoritized tracts on average benefited more from the shutdown, but the least-White tracts still were significantly worse off than the most-White tracts. We further explore this question for PM2.5, one of the most harmful air pollutants, using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to combine several different federal datasets to compare pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Analyzing Census tracts, we find (1) little evidence of discrimination in the placement of PM2.5 sensors, (2) evidence of the standard EJ disproportionality for PM2.5 in both pre-shutdown 2019 and post-shutdown 2020, but (3) evidence of disproportionate improvement for Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans, with concerning indications of possible harm to African Americans. This implies, as do the findings in Kerr and colleagues' study, that policies that limit gasoline-powered car use can reduce air pollution but are unlikely to importantly alleviate US environmental racism affecting African Americans. © 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Assessing The Welfare Impacts Of Forest Ecosystem Service Management Policies And Their Distributional Rules
JO  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Community based management (CBM) is widely advocated as an effective method for governing and managing ecosystem services (ES). However, the distributional rules and maximum harvesting levels are likely to affect both the effectiveness of CBMs in maintaining ES and the fairness and equity of access to these ES. This article proposes a methodological approach for investigating normative trade-offs involved in CBM of forests, where forest conservation objectives need to be traded off against livelihoods objectives. The study uses remote sensing methods to quantify forest ES supply in Namizimu Forest Reserve in Malawi, and links this to demand for ES within the villages near the reserve. It then investigates how a plausible set of CBM rules can be developed to cap consumption of forest products to sustainable amount and quantifies, by using monetary valuation techniques, how these set of rules may affect the total well-being of local population. Our results demonstrate that, due to the spatial mismatches between demand and supply, the distribution of provisioning ES to the population across the harvesting area is unequal in biophysical terms. The current available stock of forest products is sufficient to cover the current demand, however, it is higher than the mean annual increment indicating that this level of consumption is ecologically unsustainable and will lead to forest degradation as shown under the business-as-usual scenario. We then examined the impact of governance and how CBM rules to allocate forest ES to different social groups (poor and rich) under a co-management regime will affect total societal welfare. We found that the distributional scenario that maximises total societal welfare expressed in monetary terms across the whole harvesting area is the scenario that distributes 40\% of biomass to the rich group while the remaining 60\% is allocated to the poor group. However, this scenario maximises Willingness to Pay (WTP) at total level but does not maximise WTP in each sub-area of forest but just for those that have a high availability for biomass. This indicates that the distributional rules that maximise total welfare at aggregate level may not maximise welfare at local level where constraints from biomass availability require to restrict further the distribution of forest products. When biomass availability is low, total societal welfare is maximised with distributional rules that distribute more trees to richer. Yet, a policymaker may choose a distributional rule that distribute more trees to the poor on normative grounds and forego the objective of maximising total welfare. In such cases the WTP analysis outlined in this paper can support the policymaker in choosing the distributional rule that minimise trade-offs between efficiency, i.e., maximising total welfare, and livelihoods objectives.

TI  - Assessing Regional Public Service Facility Accessibility Using Multisource Geospatial Data: A Case Study Of Underdeveloped Areas In China
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2024
AB  - Promoting the accessibility of basic public service facilities is key to safeguarding and improving people’s lives. Effective public service provision is especially important for the sustainable development of less developed regions. Lincang in Yunnan Province is a typical underdeveloped region in China. In parallel, multisource remote sensing data with higher spatial resolution provide more precise results for small-scale regional accessibility assessment. Thus, we use an assessment method to measure and evaluate the accessibility of three types of infrastructure in Lincang based on multisource geospatial data. We further analyze the matching between public service facility accessibility and the socioeconomic attributes of inhabitant clusters and different poverty groups. The results show that the accessibility of educational facilities is currently better than that of health facilities in Lincang and that of sanitation facilities is relatively poor. Public service facility accessibility varies significantly among different types of inhabitant clusters, with better accessibility in inhabitant clusters with high levels of population density, aging, and income. Accessibility to healthcare, education, and sanitation is negatively correlated to varying degrees of poverty levels of poor groups, and the mean values of accessibility to various types of public facilities vary significantly across poor groups. Our findings can help inform policy formulation and provide theoretical support for planning and optimizing the layout of public facilities. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Temporal Mapping Of Deforestation And Forest Degradation In Nepal: Applications To Forest Conservation
JO  - Forest Ecology and Management
PY  - 2009
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are associated and progressive processes resulting in the conversion of forest area into a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pasture, and degraded habitat. Monitoring of forest landscape spatial structures has been recommended to detect degenerative trends in forest conditions. GIS and remote sensing play an important role in the generation of such data to identify degraded and deforested areas as well as potential areas for conservation. In this study we analyzed forest degradation and deforestation trends in Chitwan district in Nepal, which contains key habitat elements for wildlife in the region. An artificial neural network was used to predict forest canopy density in five classes using Landsat images of the year 2001. Forest canopy density was predicted with 82% overall accuracy. Except riverine forest, forest area of all other forest types was reduced. Terai Shorea robusta forest, which has high commercial value, showed a loss of 23% between 1976 and 1989 and an overall loss of 15% forest covers between the year 1976 and 2001. Deforestation and forest degradation disproportionately reduced the sizes of the different forest types, a finding that has important management implications. The maps presented in this article could be useful to prioritize limited resources for conservation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determination Of Soil Erosion Risk Using Rusle Model And Soil Organic Carbon Loss In Alaca Catchment (Central Black Sea Region, Turkey)
JO  - RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI
PY  - 2017
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the major threats to the conservation of soil and water resources. For that reason, predictive erosion models are useful tools for evaluating soil erosion and developing soil erosion management plans. For this aim, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) function is a widely used erosion model. This research integrated the RUSLE with a geographic information system (GIS) to investigate the spatial distribution of annual soil loss potential in the Alaca catchment in north central Black Sea region, Turkey. The rainfall erosivity factor was developed from local annual precipitation data using a modified Fournier index; the topographic factor was developed from a digital elevation model; the land cover factor was generated from satellite imagery and forest inventory maps; and the soil organic carbon level and the erodibility factor were developed from systematically collected soil samples and the application of the geostatistical method, respectively. From the model, more than the half of the total study area as in the very low and low erosion risk classes (0-12 t ha(-1) year(-1)), whereas 4.4 \% (723.6 h) of the total area was at high and very high erosion risk (35-150 and >150 t ha(-1) year(-1)), respectively. In addition, soil organic carbon density values were between 0.18 and 4.92 kg m(-2) across the catchment. Moreover, the distribution of soil organic carbon losses was closely correlated with the distribution of soil erosion risk classes in the study area. Soils and topographical properties of the watershed had a greater influence than land use/land-cover type on the magnitude of potential soil and soil organic carbon losses, because the erosivity factor did not change substantially in the study area.

TI  - Comparison Of Different Machine Learning Methods For Debris Flow Susceptibility Mapping: A Case Study In The Sichuan Province, China
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Debris flow susceptibility mapping is considered to be useful for hazard prevention and mitigation. As a frequent debris flow area, many hazardous events have occurred annually and caused a lot of damage in the Sichuan Province, China. Therefore, this study attempted to evaluate and compare the performance of four state-of-the-art machine-learning methods, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), for debris flow susceptibility mapping in this region. Four models were constructed based on the debris flow inventory and a range of causal factors. A variety of datasets was obtained through the combined application of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). The mean altitude, altitude difference, aridity index, and groove gradient played the most important role in the assessment. The performance of these modes was evaluated using predictive accuracy (ACC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results of this study showed that all four models were capable of producing accurate and robust debris flow susceptibility maps (ACC and AUC values were well above 0.75 and 0.80 separately). With an excellent spatial prediction capability and strong robustness, the BRT model (ACC = 0.781, AUC = 0.852) outperformed other models and was the ideal choice. Our results also exhibited the importance of selecting suitable mapping units and optimal predictors. Furthermore, the debris flow susceptibility maps of the Sichuan Province were produced, which can provide helpful data for assessing and mitigating debris flow hazards. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Research On Multimorbidity In Primary Care. Selected Abstracts From The Egprn Meeting In Tampere, Finland, 9-12 May 2019 All Abstracts Of The Conference Can Be Found At The Egprn Website: Www.egprn.org/Page/Conference-Abstracts
JO  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
PY  - 2019
AB  - Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide range of health services, including prevention and public health promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained. According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too. Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need more in the future is more research on new practices and models. Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication? Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland, randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist, filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n = 59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19\% of the patients in the control group and for 68\% in the intervention group. Shortly after the appointment, only 14\% of the patients in the control group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32\% in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64\% in the control group vs 95\% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new antihypertensive medications. Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation. Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP) trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018, trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44 of them 65.7\% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5\%) refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their achievements. 'Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion: Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees. Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3\%) were classified as having peripartum depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs. Incidences of depression were 17.4\% in women with a history of antidepressant medication, 16\% among women with diabetes, and 11.8\% among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without. Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy may help identify women in need of support. Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions. This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102 were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49 years. The participants' age had a significant influence on sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438 participants, 33.3\% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7\% general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education. 'Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction: 49.8\% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently. Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning. Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies, reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial. According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests the term 'effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE. Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3, 2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword 'Hawthorne Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting. Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its implication as an experimental artefact. Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise. Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming. Recent eHealth tools, such as the 'systematic tool to reduce inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10 patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients' willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss primary care in this new eHealth environment. Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide. Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions. How often it happened towards young doctors working as general practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9\%, female 87\%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of the residents were working in an urban practice (63\%), others in the rural and the suburban once (27\%, 10\%). All GP residents experienced patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them. High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was experienced by 44\%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual harassment) by 84\% while all residents experienced verbal violence. Only 13.2\% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions. Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing. Background: About 50\% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France. Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development, validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and 18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65 years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence: motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE protocol. Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe how these associations differ across different European countries and regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+ years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis will take into account differences between countries and regions. Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits, social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants (49.09\%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95\%CI: -1.29, -1.24) with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95\%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in Israel, -0.67 (95\%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL. Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking, hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy. Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004 with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7\%) were diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the age of 45 onwards was 94.0\% (95\%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8\% (95\%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was associated with a 9.0-year delay (95\%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants without risk factors was 6.0 years (95\%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent 21.6\% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8\% for those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45 years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up. Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of morbidity of NCDs. Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how: financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of recording diagnoses was about 40\% in the primary care units. After four years, the recording rate had risen to 90\% (p < 0.001). The rate of change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public. Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and communities and remains undiscovered in 90\% of the cases. In total, 80\% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the Netherlands, at least 3\% (118 000) of children are victims of child abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3\% of abuse cases are reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs' experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results: Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling that 'something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients' trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other professionals. Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts, especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results: There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care. Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity. Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e. decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up? Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status 'decompensation' or 'nothing to report' was collected. A logistic regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6\% of the population, had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days. Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039). Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others in medical literature. Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the 20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods: Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure using electronic medical records based on the International Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness diversity. Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations. Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods: Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the 'homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training, and for further research in these five countries. Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively. Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2. Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement scores. Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research, which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now. There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that 'intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different challenges to researchers and health services compared to 'active psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward. This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also the scale. Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR) database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records. Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented, stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the context of multimorbidity. Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48\% female. Thirty-one percent lived alone, and 85\% prepared their medication themselves, all others required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular medicines and 24\% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76\%) were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78\% did not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96\%), long-term drugs (56\%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92\%). When it comes to deprescribing, 89\% of participants wanted as much information as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP was a further key factor to them (85\%). Conclusion: Most older adults are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared decision-making with the GP they trust. Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity, general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need' patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to automatically create a list of possible 'high need' patients could be a quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients. Research question: Can 'high need' patients with multimorbidity be identified automatically from their primary care medical records? Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were identified, of which 48\% were above the age of 65 and 57\% female. More than 42\% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62\% used five or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC: 0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: 'High need' patients with multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care. Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies. Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up? Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted, estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2) the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP. Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total, 916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific (42.0\% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases (19.3\%), osteometabolic (7.9\%), cardio-circulatory (6.6\%), and others. Most patients, minimum 59.2\%, remained in the same cluster during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1\%) and nervous (31.8\%) MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs. Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the general population. Research question: What is the best possible reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36, SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to 0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as no external validity is available. Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question: This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test. We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer, receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment, anaemia less than 9 mg\%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637 patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September 2017. The following information was collected: age, gender, socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA, CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of infection between 29 and 60\%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c increased the risk by 8.5\%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the infection increases the chance of infection by 734\%. Conclusion: Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much more significant risk factor.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Automatic building detection with satellite and aerial images is a hot topic in remote sensing area. Especially, in recent years generation of high resolution Lidar data increased the success of building detection algorithms. In the proposed approach seed points in high elevation areas are obtained by applying morphological operations on Lidar data. Then, geodesic distances between this seed and other elevation points are calculated. Next, a mask is generated using distance map with shadow and vegetation information. Finally, this mask is given to the graph cut optimization and building detection is performed. Obtained results are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results showed that our algorithm produced comparable precision and recall values with them. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Analysis Of Spatial-Temporal Dynamics Pattern Of Urbanization In Xinjiang Oasis, Using Glcnmo And Dcw Data
PY  - 2016
AB  - Although there exist numerous urban growth models, most have significant data input requirements, limiting their utility in a developing world context. Yet, it is precisely in developing world where there is an urgent need for urban growth models since most expected urban growth in next two decades will occur in such countries and regions. Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region located in Northwest part of China. It makes up about 1/6 of the total land area of China. Xinjiang has its distinctive uses for its land, due to its arid climate, and unusually geomorphic characteristics. Oasis is the living place of the people in arid area. Oases are unique landscape in arid and semi arid regions of the world. In this study, urban area in Xinjiang Oasis was analyzed using remote sensing and GIS. Utilizing binary urban/nonurban maps generated by MODIS and DMSP-OLS. Our model can inform urban planners and policy makers about the most probable locations and periods of future urban land cover change. Urban development was achieving momentum in Xinjiang oasis. The MODIS and nighttime light data have many advantages, such as high time resolution, continuity and low cost. It should be very useful to detect larger scale dynamics of environmental changes.

TI  - Multitemporal Image Cloud Removal Using Group Sparsity And Nonconvex Low-Rank Approximation
JO  - JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR AND VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) images are widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and land surface classification. However, RS images are often polluted by cloud, which leads to the loss of some important information of RS images and hinders the development of relevant applications. The existing spatial-spectral total-variational regularization can only promote the spatial-spectral continuity of cloud component, but cannot maintain the shared group sparse mode of spatial difference images of different spectral bands. To solve this problem, we add the weighted \& POUND;2,1-norm to constrain the cloud component differential images, and use the nonconvex regularization term, namely the weighted nuclear norm, to replace the traditional nuclear norm, which solves the problem that the original nuclear norm violates the larger singular value. In summary, we propose a multitemporal image cloud removal model based on the weighted nuclear norm which is the nonconvex low-rank approximation and the group sparsity regularization (WNGS), where the group sparsity regularization and the weighted nuclear norm promote each other. The resulting problems are solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical experiments both simulated and real multitemporal images demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other advanced cloud-removal methods in different cloud-removal scenarios.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Gully erosion is an important soil degradation process, which under climate changes is projected to increase. Therefore, better understating of factors controlling gully erosion and prediction of gully headcuts' (GHs) location is still highly relevant. This study aimed to examine the spatial distribution of GHs and to assess the importance of pedological (i.e. aggregate stability, organic matter, bulk density, silt, clay, and sand content) and topographical factors (i.e. altitude, slope length, gradient, and aspect) using summary statistics and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The study was conducted in the loess-covered region of NE Iran. The highly precise data of 287 GHs locations were obtained by extensive fieldwork and the interpretation of UAV images. The spatial distribution of GHs was evaluated by univariate pair correlation function and O-ring statistics. The spatial effect of GHs density controlling factors was assessed by the cumulative density correlation function Cm,K(r). Variable importance was analyzed using the MaxEnt model, which was also for the susceptibility modelling of GHs. The results of univariate tests showed the aggregated distribution of GHs. The Cm,K(r) analyses indicated that the areas characterized by higher values of bulk density, aggregate stability, and organic matter content have lower GHs density, whereas the areas with high silt content and higher slope gradient have higher GHs density. According to the MaxEnt, there is no one single factor responsible for GHs location, but rather the combination of topographical and pedological factors with the predominance of slope gradient (0.86) and silt content (0.57). The MaxEnt modelling of GHs susceptibility has revealed that the best accuracy (0.958) is given when all pedological and topographical factors are used in the model. The susceptibility maps prepared in the study can be used for soil conversation and land use planning and, consequently, for sustainable development in the region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analysis Of Thermal Environment By Urban Expansion Using Kompsat And Landsat 8: Sejong City
JO  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban population growth and consequent rapid urbanization involve some thermal environmental problems in the cities. Monitoring of thermal environments in urban areas such as hot spot analysis is required for effective actions to resolve these problems. This study selected 14 dongs and surrounding administrative districts of Sejong city as study areas and analyzed the characteristics of changes in surface temperature due to the urban expansion in the summer from 2013 to 2018. In the study, the surface temperature distributions in the study areas were plotted using surface temperature values from Landsat 8 and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) based on KOMPSAT 2/3 data, and the patterns of surface temperature changes with urban expansion were discussed using the estimated NDVI and NDBI. In particular, the distinct urbanization in the study areas were selected for case studies, and the cause of the changes in the hot spots in the regions was analyzed using high-resolution KOMPSAT images. This study results present that hot spots appeared in urbanized regions within the study areas, and it was plotted that the lower the NDVI values and the higher the NDBI values indicate the temperature values are high. The land surface temperature and satellite-based products were used to divide the study areas into continuously urbanized regions and rapidly urbanized regions and to identify the different characteristics depending on land covers. In the regions with distinct surface temperature changes by urbanization, the analysis using high-resolution KOMPSAT images as presented in this study could provide effective information for urban planning and policy utilization in the future.

TI  - Alert-Driven Vs Scheduled Remote Monitoring Of Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators: A Cost–Consequence Analysis From The Trust Trial
JO  - Heart Rhythm
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background: Alert-driven remote patient monitoring (RPM) or fully virtual care without routine evaluations may reduce clinic workload and promote more efficient resource allocation, principally by diminishing nonactionable patient encounters. Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost–consequence analysis to compare 3 postimplant implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) follow-up strategies: (1) in-person evaluation (IPE) only; (2) RPM–conventional (hybrid of IPE and RPM); and (3) RPM–alert (alert-based ICD follow-up). Methods: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate the costs and benefits of the 3 strategies over a 2-year time horizon from the perspective of the US Medicare payer. Aggregate and patient-level data from the TRUST (Lumos-T Safely RedUceS RouTine Office Device Follow-up) randomized clinical trial informed clinical effectiveness model inputs. TRUST randomized 1339 patients 2:1 to conventional RPM or IPE alone, and found that RPM was safe and reduced the number of nonactionable encounters. Cost data were obtained from the published literature. The primary outcome was incremental cost. Results: Mean cumulative follow-up costs per patient were $12,688 in the IPE group, $12,001 in the RPM–conventional group, and $11,011 in the RPM–alert group. Compared to the IPE group, both the RPM–conventional and RPM–alert groups were associated with lower incremental costs of –$687 (95% confidence interval [CI] –$2138 to +$638) and –$1,677 (95% CI –$3134 to –$304), respectively. Therefore, the RPM–alert strategy was most cost-effective, with an estimated cost-savings in 99% of simulations. Conclusions: Alert-driven RPM was economically attractive and, if patient outcomes and safety are comparable to those of conventional RPM, may be the preferred strategy for ICD follow-up. © 2022 Heart Rhythm Society

TI  - Rapid Mapping And Assessment Of Damages Due To Typhoon Rai Using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2022
AB  - Typhoon Rai has recently affected central and southern parts of the Philippines. Based on the valuation of the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), it is estimated that the typhoon has damaged 1,700 buildings, 2 million houses, and 10 million hectares of agricultural land in the affected locations. Given the effects of the typhoon, in terms of the extent of the area where it has caused destruction, the tremendous economic losses due to its incurred damages, and to the number of people affected by it, it became necessary to create rapid damage assessment maps that could provide the needed geospatial information to emergency responders so they can prioritize areas of most concern. In this effort, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was used due to the data's temporal resolution (i.e., pre- and post-disaster images are available), relative independence from atmospheric conditions (i.e., unaffected by cloud cover), and open-access availability (i.e., data can be readily downloaded after the typhoon). Complex coherence correlation from stacks of pre- and post-disaster SAR images were analyzed for change detection in order to create the rapid damage assessment maps. In order to validate the results, ancillary data (i.e., aerial photos, local reports, and UNITAR / UNOSAT damage tags and maps) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the maps. Upon analysis, we found that there is good correspondence between the SAR-derived maps and the aerial photos/UNITAR maps and that the damage tags by UNITAR / UNOSAT would match the rapid damage assessment maps to up to 93% if the correlation threshold is set to 0.5 and if the damage classification is set to just two levels (i.e., "damaged"and "not damaged"). It is deemed that the resulting maps of this research will be useful in the on-going efforts to rehabilitate the affected areas of Typhoo Rai. Future work includes further ground validation efforts and use of other datasets and methods in deriving the rapid damage assessment maps. © Authors 2022

TI  - Characterizing Spatial Patterns Of Pine Wood Nematode Outbreaks In Subtropical Zone In China
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xyophilus, originating from North America, has caused great ecological and economic hazards to pine trees worldwide, especially affecting the coniferous forests and mixed forests of masson pine in subtropical regions of China. In order to prevent PWN disease expansion, the risk level and susceptivity of PWN outbreaks need to be predicted in advance. For this purpose, we established a prediction model to estimate the susceptibility and risk level of PWN with vegetation condition variables, anthropogenic activity variables, and topographic feature variables across a large-scale district. The study was conducted in Dangyang City, Hubei Province in China, which was located in a subtropical zone. Based on the location of PWN points derived from airborne imagery and ground survey in 2018, the predictor variables were conducted with remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) data, which contained vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and normalized red edge index (NDRE) from Sentinel-2 imagery in the previous year (2107), the distance to different level roads which indicated anthropogenic activity, topographic variables in including elevation, slope, and aspect. We compared the fitting effects of different machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), K-neighborhood (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) and predicted the probability of the presence of PWN disease in the region. In addition, we classified PWN points to different risk levels based on the density distribution of PWN sites and built a PWN risk level model to predict the risk levels of PWN outbreaks in the region. The results showed that: (1) the best model for the predictive probability of PWN presence is the RF classification algorithm. For the presence prediction of the dead trees caused by PWN, the detection rate (DR) was 96.42%, the false alarm rate (FAR) was 27.65%, the false detection rate (FDR) was 4.16%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was equal to 0.96; (2) anthropogenic activity variables had the greatest effect on PWN occurrence, while the effects of slope and aspect were relatively weak, and the maximum, minimum, and median values of remote sensing indices were more correlated with PWN occurrence; (3) modeling analysis of different risk levels of PWN outbreak indicated that high-risk level areas were the easiest to monitor and identify, while lower incidence areas were identified with relatively low accuracy. The overall accuracy of the risk level of the PWN outbreak was identified with an AUC value of 0.94. From the research findings, remote sensing data combined with GIS data can accurately predict the probability distribution of the occurrence of PWN disease. The accuracy of identification of high-risk areas is higher than other risk levels, and the results of the study may improve control of PWN disease spread. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Support To Environmental Emergencies With Deimos-1: Examples Of 2012 Floods In Australia And Forest Fires In Spain
JO  - American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Annual Conference, ASPRS 2013
PY  - 2013
AB  - Requirements to be met by satellite data provision for natural disaster management are specially demanding in terms of timeliness from activation to image sensing and delivery. This paper reflects the operational approach set up by DEIMOS-1 for rush data provision in emergency exercises using two examples. The February 2012 flood event in Australia impacted over 100,000 km2. DEIMOS-1, in cooperation with Astrium Geo-Information Services - Australia, triggered an emergency campaign following a three-step methodology: image rush tasking according to local knowledge of flood location from emergency service staff, rush delivery of a 300m/pixel quicklook of the acquired images a few hours after sensing (for evaluation of cloudiness and first assessment of flooded areas), rush delivery of full-resolution orthorectified images a few hours after sensing for in-depth analysis of real flood conditions. This procedure was carried out by the DEIMOS-1 24/7 team and up to 26 images were delivered from early February to mid March 2012. DEIMOS-1 imagery was processed by the National Earth Observation group within Geoscience Australia to map the flood extents and evaluate affected roads, houses and infrastructure (bridges, culverts, and small dams). A similar campaign has been run by Elecnor Deimos Imaging to observe with DEIMOS-1 the forest fires in Spain between June and September 2012. The service included the systematic acquisition of all possible images over the country, the identification of affected areas and the rapid generation of thematic maps and quantitative analyses. All value added products were made available just one working day after the image sensing. This service provided pre- And post-event images of two large fires to the European Space Agency in the frame of a GMES emergency activation (with delivery of archive images in less than one hour), and burned areas maps to the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment.

TI  - Hyperspectral Data Simulation (Sentinel-2 To Aviris-Ng) For Improved Wildfire Fuel Mapping, Boreal Alaska
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Alaska has witnessed a significant increase in wildfire events in recent decades that have been linked to drier and warmer summers. Forest fuel maps play a vital role in wildfire management and risk assessment. Freely available multispectral datasets are widely used for land use and land cover mapping, but they have limited utility for fuel mapping due to their coarse spectral resolution. Hyperspectral datasets have a high spectral resolution, ideal for detailed fuel mapping, but they are limited and expensive to acquire. This study simulates hyperspectral data from Sentinel-2 multispectral data using the spectral response function of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor, and normalized ground spectra of gravel, birch, and spruce. We used the Uniform Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM) for spectral unmixing, which is a sensor-independent method, where each pixel is expressed as the linear sum of standard reference spectra. The simulated hyperspectral data have spectral characteristics of AVIRIS-NG and the reflectance properties of Sentinel-2 data. We validated the simulated spectra by visually and statistically comparing it with real AVIRIS-NG data. We observed a high correlation between the spectra of tree classes collected from AVIRIS-NG and simulated hyperspectral data. Upon performing species level classification, we achieved a classification accuracy of 89\% for the simulated hyperspectral data, which is better than the accuracy of Sentinel-2 data (77.8\%). We generated a fuel map from the simulated hyperspectral image using the Random Forest classifier. Our study demonstrated that low-cost and high-quality hyperspectral data can be generated from Sentinel-2 data using UPDM for improved land cover and vegetation mapping in the boreal forest.

TI  - Pirra Jungku: Comparison Of Traditional And Contemporary Fire Practices On Karajarri Country, Western Australia
JO  - ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Traditional fire practices in Australia's deserts may have created mosaics of post-fire seral stages that benefitted some plants and animals. Managing fire to emulate the patterns produced by traditional burning practices is a common objective in contemporary conservation planning in Australia's deserts. However, the extent to which traditional burning in deserts affected fire regimes across space and time is contested. We aim to contribute to knowledge about the impacts of traditional burning on fire patterns in the Great Sandy Desert, northwest Australia. Our study covered the traditional lands of the Karajarri people, where some families were living a traditional lifestyle on Country until the 1960s. We analysed high-quality aerial photographs taken over 18,000 km(2) of Karajarri Country in the 1940s. Fire footprints up to several years old were mapped from these images, and their spatial characteristics were compared to those of contemporary fire regimes over the same area, visualised using high-resolution Sentinel satellite imagery. Fires in the 1940s (considered traditional) were more numerous but much smaller than contemporary (2016-2020) fires. The areal extent of recently burnt areas was smaller and the fire frequency was lower in the 1940s. Contemporary fire patterns around cultural sites differed little from fire patterns elsewhere in the landscape, possibly because people were burning over large areas rather than only at localised sites. Our study suggests that Karajarri influenced fire patterns at a landscape scale in the Great Sandy Desert, at least during periods of average rainfall. The findings are helping Karajarri refine fire management goals, for example, by informing the size and dispersion of future burns, and supporting community discussion about fire and culture. Fire management outcomes for plants and animals are being tracked with a biodiversity monitoring program.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence And Arthroplasty At A Single Institution: Real-World Applications Of Machine Learning To Big Data, Value-Based Care, Mobile Health, And Remote Patient Monitoring
JO  - Journal of Arthroplasty
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Driven by the recent ubiquity of big data and computing power, we established the Machine Learning Arthroplasty Laboratory (MLAL) to examine and apply artificial intelligence (AI) to musculoskeletal medicine. Methods: In this review, we discuss the 2 core objectives of the MLAL as they relate to the practice and progress of orthopedic surgery: (1) patient-specific, value-based care and (2) human movement. Results: We developed and validated several machine learning-based models for primary lower extremity arthroplasty that preoperatively predict patient-specific, risk-adjusted value metrics, including cost, length of stay, and discharge disposition, to provide improved expectation management, preoperative planning, and potential financial arbitration. Additionally, we leveraged passive, ubiquitous mobile technologies to build a small data registry of human movement surrounding TKA that permits remote patient monitoring to evaluate therapy compliance, outcomes, opioid intake, mobility, and joint range of motion. Conclusion: The rapid rate with which we in arthroplasty are acquiring and storing continuous data, whether passively or actively, demands an advanced processing approach: AI. By carefully studying AI techniques with the MLAL, we have applied this evolving technique as a first step that may directly improve patient outcomes and practice of orthopedics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Investigation On Water Productivity Of Winter Wheat Based On Modis And Sebal In The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain
JO  - Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology
PY  - 2017
AB  - Understanding how the crop water productivity can be increased is widely accepted to be a high priority where water resources are currently scarce and/or over-exploited in China. As the primary data source, MODIS remote sensing, statistics, meteorological data, crop growth period data and ground truth-data from Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2012 were used in actual evapotranspiration estimation, yields rasterizing, and water productivity calculation for winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain(3H Plain). The statistical data for wheat yield was synthesized to calculate district-state-level land productivity, which is then further extrapolated to pixel-level values using a MODIS NDVI image, based on a crop dominance map. Spatial variation of crop water productivity was investigated in order to reveal the key factors of crop water productivity. In addition, the relationship between water productivity and actual evapotranspiration and in subsequence yield for winter wheat was discussed in 3H Plain. The main results indicated that the SEBAL is suitable for estimating evapotranspiration in winter wheat based on the comparison with the evapotranspiration measured by Yucheng (in Shandong province). The regional average value of water productivity for winter wheat was detected to be 1. 21kgm-3, with the higher value in Beijing, Tianjin, north part of Shandong province and south part of Hebei province. The pronounced relationship of spatial correlation of the yield and water productivity for winter wheat indicated that the increasing yield governed the increment of water productivity for winter wheat in the coastal land-farming-fishing area (zone1), low plain-hydropenia irrigable land and dry land zone (zone2) and basin-irrigable land and dry land (zone5). Whereas, the increasing water productivity for winter wheat was recognized to be controlled by rather the increment of yield than the reduction of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for winter wheat in the piedmont plain-irrigable land (zone2). Furthermore, the pronounced relationship of negative correlation of water productivity and ETa for winter wheat described that only the reduction of ETa was responsible for the increment of water productivity for winter wheat in hill-wet hot paddy-paddy field (zone6). The results is expected to provide a basis information for agricultural water management, improvements of crop water productivity and choice of adaptive mechanism under climate change in Huang-Huai-Hai plain. © 2016 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

TI  - Response Of Runoff To The Climate And Land Use Pattern Changes In Shiyang River Basin
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2015
AB  - Shiyang River Basin is one of the inland rivers, which have the highest population density, the highest utilization level of water resources, the most prominent contradiction with water, and the most serious ecological environment problems. Under the background of climate change, the landscape patterns based on desert of Shiyang River Basin have taken place great changes, and thus affected the hydrological processes profoundly, including a decrease in runoff and an increase in conflicts between water demands and water supplies. In this case, the government had made policies on social and economic development, and also enforced a series of the ecological restoration project to slow ecological deterioration down, but the trend was not reversed. In order to achieve sustainable use of soil and water resources, it is very urgent for use to study on the relationship between the evolvement of water resources and the pattern of land use, and to evaluate the role of climate change and the contribution of land use change in the changes of water resources in distribution patterns respectively. In this paper, based on the long-term observed data of meteorological and hydrological process and four periods of TM image data of Shiyang River Basin, the runoff process simulation model was established, which only focused on the factors of climate and land use change. And the the response characteristic of runoff to the climate and land use change were explored, and also the trend of runoff was predicted. The meteorological data from 1956 to 2009 of Wushaoling and Wuwei weather stations were all from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System and the remote sensing information was from the Landsat/TM4 image data received by China's remote sensing satellite ground station, including the year of 1986, 2000, 2006 and 2010. The monthly and annual runoff data of upstream six rivers and Caiqi section in Shiyang River basin were partly from electronic material provided by Shiyang river basin administration, and partly from water resources bulletin of it. The results show: Firstly, the annual amount of river runoff arriving at Caiqi section were decreased to 1.096×108m3 at present from 5.392×108 m3 of the 1950's during the period of 1956 to 2009, and before 1968, the runoff fluctuation of Caiqi section was mainly caused by climate change. However, after 1968 it was affected by the interaction of climate and land use change. Secondly, the average contribution rate of climate to the change of downstream river runoff was 4.1 percent, while the contribution rate of land use change, especially the cultivated land change, was up to 88.8 percent in recent 30 years. If the midstream irrigation water reduced by 5 percent,10 percent,15 percent and 20 percent respectively, the simulation value of downstream river runoff would be up to 1.591×108 m3, 2.427×108 m3, 3.262×108 m3,and 4.098×108 m3, respectively. This suggested that if water-saving facilities and water-saving technology, especially high and new irrigation technology were adopted, the governance goal of increasing the amount of water from 2.600×108 m3 to 2.900×108 m3 in Caiqi section in 2010 would be achieved early without the irrigated areas decrease. In a word, the fundamental way of ecological restoration lies in water saving in Shiyang River basin. © 2015, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

AB  - Object building and the extraction of homogeneous landscape units on which spatial statistics can be applied is useful in assessing land use and land cover change. Object-oriented processing techniques are becoming more popular compared to traditional pixel-based image analysis. A hierarchical image segmentation approach was adopted to extract the objects from multi-temporal Landsat images over Zimbabwe. The spatial arrangement of t(0) and t(1) objects was independent as the segmentation process was independently applied, although object change of t(1) was based on t(0) boundaries. We applied a Standardized, Object Oriented, Automatic Classification (SOOAC) method based on fuzzy logic. The error matrix for the TM image had an overall accuracy of 95.6\% and a KIA value of 94.7\%, the ETM showed slightly lower overall accuracy. Various LULC changes were identified over the 13 year period per object and also per class, mainly vegetation decrease. Object-oriented change information is necessary in decision support systems and uncertainty management strategies. This approach addresses some of the major issues in object-based GIS change analysis as it is based on stable object geometry. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Chlorophyll Dynamics From Sentinel-3 Using An Optimized Algorithm For Enhanced Ecological Monitoring In Complex Urban Estuarine Waters
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urban estuaries are dynamic environments that hold high ecological and economic value. Yet, their optical complexity hinders accurate satellite retrievals of important biogeochemical variables, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) biomass. Approaches based on a limited number of satellite spectral bands often fail to capture seasonal transitions and sharp spatial gradients in estuarine Chl-a concentrations, inhibiting integration of satellite data into water quality monitoring and conservation programs. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the wide range of spectral information captured by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) to retrieve estuarine Chl-a. To validate our approach, we used measurements in Long Island Sound (LIS), a highly urbanized estuary increasingly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors and climate change. Hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and Chl-a data representing the spatiotemporal diversity of LIS were used to assess the ideal atmospheric correction approach for OLCI and develop a multi-spectral multiple linear regression (MS-MLR) Chl-a algorithm. POLYMER derived Rrs proved to be the preferred atmospheric correction approach. Evaluation of MS-MLR performance in retrieving Chl-a with in situ Rrs showed good agreement with field measurements. Application to OLCI-retrieved Rrs showed significant improvement (20\%-30\%) in common error metrics relative to other algorithms assessed. The MS-MLR approach successfully captured seasonal cycles and spatial gradients in Chl-a concentration. Application of this method to urban estuaries and coasts enables accurate, high resolution Chl-a observations at the ecosystem scale and across a range of conditions, as needed for conservation and ecosystem management efforts.

TI  - Population Estimation In Singapore Based On Remote Sensing And Open Data
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2017
AB  - Population estimation statistics are widely used in government, commercial and educational sectors for a variety of purposes. With growing emphases on real-time and detailed population information, data users nowadays have switched from traditional census data to more technology-based data source such as LiDAR point cloud and High-Resolution Satellite Imagery. Nevertheless, such data are costly and periodically unavailable. In this paper, the authors use West Coast District, Singapore as a case study to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of using satellite image from Google Earth for extraction of building footprint and population estimation. At the same time, volunteered geographic information (VGI) is also utilized as ancillary data for building footprint extraction. Open data such as Open Street Map (OSM) could be employed to enhance the extraction process. In view of challenges in building shadow extraction, this paper discusses several methods including buffer, mask and shape index to improve accuracy. It also illustrates population estimation methods based on building height and number of floor estimates. The results show that the accuracy level of housing unit method on population estimation can reach 92.5%, which is remarkably accurate. This paper thus provides insights into techniques for building extraction and fine-scale population estimation, which will benefit users such as urban planners in terms of policymaking and urban planning of Singapore. © Authors 2017.

TI  - Persistence And Remote Sensing Of Agri-Food Wastes In The Environment: Current State And Perspectives
JO  - CHEMOSPHERE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Food demand is expected to increase globally by 60-110\% from 2005 to 2050 due to diet shifts and population growth. This growth in food demand leads to the generation of enormous agri-food wastes (AFWs), which could be classified into pre-consumption and post-consumption. The AFW represents economic losses for all stakeholders along food supply chains, including consumers. It is reported that the direct financial, social, and environmental costs of food waste are 1, 0.9, and 0.7 trillion USD/year, respectively. Diverse conventional AFW management approaches are employed at the different life cycle levels (entre supply chain). The review indicates that inadequate transportation, erroneous packaging, improper storage, losses during processing, contamination, issues with handling, and expiry dates are the main reason for the generation of AFWs in the supply chain. Further, various variables such as cultural, societal, personal, and behavioral factors contribute to the AFW generation. The selection of a specific valorization technology is based on multiple physicochemical and biological parameters. Furthermore, other factors like heterogeneity of the AFWs, preferable energy carriers, byproducts management, cost, end-usage applications, and environmental legislative and disposal processes also play a crucial role in adopting suitable technology. Valorization of AFW could significantly impact both economy and the environment. AFWs have been widely investigated for the development of engineered added-value biomaterials and renewable energy production. Considering this, this study has been carried out to highlight the significance of AFW cost, aggregation, quantification, and membrane-based strategies for its management. The study also explored the satellite remote sensing data for Spatio-temporal monitoring, mapping, optimization, and management of AFW management. Along with this, the study also explained the most recent strategies for AFW valorization and outlined the detailed policy recommendation along with opportunities and challenges. The review suggested that AFW should be managed using a triple-bottom-line strategy (economic, social, and environmental sustainability).

JO  - SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are generally associated with environment pollution and the degradation of natural resources. Detecting LULC changes is essential to assess the impact on ecosystem services. The current research studies the impact of the LULC change on the soil loss and sediment export in a period of 43 years from 1972 to 2015. Landsat imageries were classified into five classes using a supervised classification method and the maximum likelihood Algorithm. Then, the sediment retention service for avoiding reservoir sedimentation was assessed using the InVEST SDR (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs sediment delivery ratio) model. The results showed that the changes are very important in this study period (1972-2015). Forests were reduced by 18.72\% and croplands were increased by approximately 54\%. The InVEST SDR model simulation results reveal an increase in the sediment export and soil loss, respectively, from 1.68 to 5.57 t/ha/year and from 15.22 to 43.61 t/ha/year from the year 1972 to 2015. These results highlight the need for targeted policies on integrated land and water resource management. Then, it is important to improve the common understanding of land use and land cover dynamics to the different stakeholders. All these can help in projecting future changes in the LULC and to investigate more appropriate policy interventions for achieving better land and water management.

TI  - Evaluation Of Wetland Ecosystem Health Using Geospatial Technology: Evidence From The Lower Gangetic Flood Plain In India
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - The floodplain wetland habitat in the lower Gangetic plains of West Bengal played a significant role in protecting from environmental degradation like pollution, lowering groundwater table, natural hazards, and others as well as supports for human wellbeing. Thus, it is needed to investigate the health status of wetlands and suggest restoration strategies to protect the livelihood patterns dependent on wetlands. This paper presents the health of the wetland ecosystem by comprising the wetland ecosystem health index (WHI) in 2011 and 2018 at the block level of Malda district, as a part of the lower Gangetic flood plain using the pressure-state-response model (PSR model) and AHP method. A total number of six Landsat satellite images and statistical census data were used to determine the wetland health. Wetlands are classified as very healthy (2.81-3.33), healthy (2.41-2.80), sub-healthy (2.01-2.40), unhealthy (1.61-2.00), and sick (0-1.60) category on the basis of the wetland ecosystem health index score. The results of this study showed that the wetlands located surrounding English Bazar, Manikchak, Ratua-II, and Kaliachak-II blocks have a sub-healthy to very healthy condition in 2011 but changed to unhealthy to sick category in 2018 due to the increase of rapid urbanization, population density, and development activities. These areas have belonged to the sub-healthy to sick category in the year 2011 as well as 2018 due to high wetland pressure. Our observation reveals that the ecosystem service value provided by wetlands decreased by 62.51\% and 20.46 in the observed period. Management of WEH should emphasize on large (>100 ha) and medium (51-100 ha) sizes of wetlands in the Diara region of West Bengal. Developing local-level institutions and setting restoration goals are useful strategies to manage wetland resources, and protecting biodiversity should be guided by the Government organization and NGOs.

TI  - Evaluation Of Land Ecological Environment In Zhoushan Islands By Remotely Sensed Impervious Surfaces
PY  - 2013
AB  - Coastal islands are located in a transitional environment where land and ocean interact. During the past 20 years, large areas of the natural landscape of Zhoushan islands have been replaced by human features. There is limited research detailing the amount of impervious surface growth in the Zhoushan islands and trends in the land environment using remotely sensed technologies. The purpose of this paper is to assess the influences of anthropogenic activities on land ecological environment in Zhoushan islands based on remotely sensed impervious surfaces. First the impervious surfaces information of 1986, 1995 and 2006 were estimated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, and then an integrated state indicator was built. The results reveal that imperious surfaces areas (ISA) of Zhoushan islands remarkably increased from 19.2 km(2) (2.73\%) in 1986 to 29.5 km(2) (4.20\%) in 1995, and to 58.2 km(2) (8.27\%) in 2006. The average state value for the total area was 0.70, 0.65, and 0.55 respectively for 1986, 1995, and 2006. Of the surrounding islands, the Lujiazhi, Xiaogan, Panzhi, and Cezi suffered the most land disturbance intensity from human activities, followed by the Jintang, Xiushan, and Damao, and the Changbai and Changzhi had the lowest disturbance values. It indicates that the land ecological environment of Zhoushan islands was variously disturbed by growing human activities over time. Further, we found that the topography, island size, spatial location from Zhoushan Island and economic policy had an influence on change of impervious surfaces for each island.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Wetland Flooding At A Sub-Pixel Scale Based On Random Forests And Spatial Attraction Models
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - Wetland flooding is significant for the flora and fauna of wetlands. High temporal resolution remote sensing images are widely used for the timely mapping of wetland flooding but have a limitation of their relatively low spatial resolutions. In this study, a novel method based on random forests and spatial attraction models (RFSAM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of sub-pixel mapping of wetland flooding (SMWF) using remote sensing images. A random forests-based SMWF algorithm (RM-SMWF) was developed firstly, and a comprehensive complexity index of a mixed pixel was formulated. Then the RFSAM-SMWF method was developed. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of two wetlands of international importance included in the Ramsar List were used to evaluate RFSAM-SMWF against three other SMWF methods, and it consistently achieved more accurate sub-pixel mapping results in terms of visual and quantitative assessments in the two wetlands. The effects of the number of trees in random forests and the complexity threshold on the mapping accuracy of RFSAM-SMWF were also discussed. The results of this study improve the mapping accuracy of wetland flooding from medium-low spatial resolution remote sensing images and therefore benefit the environmental studies of wetlands. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Estimation Of The Deep Drainage For Irrigated Cropland Based On Satellite Observations And Deep Neural Networks
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2023
AB  - The deep drainage of irrigated cropland, which is one of the main causes of water losses in irrigation, plays an important role in water resource management. However, its magnitudes and variations remain unclear at regional scales. In this study, we established a remote sensing deep drainage model for irrigated cropland (ICDD_RS model) based on satellite observations and a deep neural network (DNN). First, deep drainage for natural vegetation was calculated by the water balance equation. Then, the ICDD_RS model was established by linking the calculated deep drainage and remote sensing data for natural vegetation based on a DNN. Finally, the model was used to predict the deep drainage of irrigated cropland through remote sensing data. The model was tested in the Heihe River Basin of China and the results showed the following: (1) The ICDD_RS model can well describe the relationship between deep drainage and selected influencing factors (0.83 < R2 < 0.86). At the site scale, it is highly consistent with in-situ observations with R2 values of 0.86, 0.74, and 0.71 for the Daman, Yingke, and Pingchuan stations, respectively. At the catchment scale, a low bias of 12% is obtained. (2) Deep drainage is large, accounting for 6–17% of the irrigation water. This model should be valuable in providing more detailed and effective information on agricultural water resource management. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Use Of Bayesian Belief Networks To Aid In The Understanding And Management Of Large-Scale Coral Bleaching
PY  - 2003
AB  - In this paper we utilise a collection of modelling tools based on the Bayesian paradigm, to develop a framework that is capable of delivering the continuum of "value added" science; the progression from the acquisition of field-based and remotely-sensed evidence, through to the development of decision support structures that have the potential to assist decision making for the management of complex systems. By way of example, we utilize the approach to identify the relative strengths of dependency of a range of potential causative factors associated with the presence-absence of large-scale coral bleaching. For the factors considered, we show that short-term maximums in sea surface temperatures provide the strongest causative link to bleaching related coral mortality. We demonstrate however that the composition of the coral community affords some level of protection against temperature related mortality. We discuss the benefits of the outlined methodology in terms of providing a decision support platform to aid in the management of large-scale coral reefs ecosystems; a system in which cur-rent and future uncertainties can not be ignored.

TI  - Quantifying Linkages Between Watershed Factors And Coastal Wetland Plant Invasion In The Us Great Lakes
JO  - Landscape Ecology
PY  - 2020
AB  - Context: Freshwater coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including habitat, nutrient uptake, coastal stabilization, and aesthetic value, but the integrity of these ecosystems is threatened by invasion of non-native competitors. Invasive species, such as Phragmites and Typha, are a concern in these wetlands, as they can dominate and outcompete native species. Objectives: This work sets out to understand the conditions that allow invasive species to dominate. This will allow for better management of landscapes and wetlands. Methods: We bring together two datasets to relate landscape conditions to coastal wetland invasion: (1) a spatially explicit map of nutrient inputs (SENSEmap) across the US Great Lakes Basin, and (2) a satellite land use map that includes explicit classifications of wetlands. Using machine learning algorithms, we quantified correlations between wetland plant invasion along the coastline to nutrient loads (both N and P) and other landscape scale variables (hydraulic conductivity, slope, imperviousness, land use, and land cover) across multiple influence zones. Results: We find that high invasion is typically associated with nitrogen loading above 118 kg/ha/year within the watersheds of the invaded wetlands. Forest cover of < 27% is associated with high invasion. Conversely, nearshore slope of > 2.6% and phosphorus loads < 2.8 kg/ha/year are associated with low invasion. Through N:P ratios, phosphorus was further identified as important. Overall, areas more anthropogenically impacted were more associated with invasion. Conclusions: We conclude that high nitrogen and low forest cover are correlated with invasion. These conclusions will inform management, as well as future efforts to identify linkages between landscapes and coastal invasion. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Understanding High-Throughput Satellites: Market Disruptions, Technology, And Value Analysis
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2019
AB  - High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) are a distinctive class of communication satellites that provide significantly more throughput per allocated bandwidth than traditional wide-beam communication satellites. They are the proverbial wave of creative disruption in the space industry and are poised to disrupt the communication market in significant ways. The first objective of this work is to introduce these satellites, discuss their markets, and present their underlying technology base. The second objective is to develop a decision-analytic framework for assessing the value of HTS and to provide meaningful results of the value of such systems under realistic design, operational, and market conditions. We develop the cost and revenue models of HTS. To build the revenue model, we develop a hybrid data-driven and scenario-based load factor model that combines historical data based on financial records from current HTS operators with extrapolations based on best-, nominal-, and worst-case scenarios. We then integrate the cost and revenue models within a stochastic simulation environment and perform Monte-Carlo analysis of the net present value (NPV) of HTS. One important result is that a medium-size HTS significantly outperforms a roughly equivalent traditional wide-beam satellite, even under the worst-case loading scenario. Another important result here identified and quantified is the trade-off between the average revenue per user (ARPU) and average loading of the satellite and how it is mediated by the downlink speed provided to consumers. This result can be used in different ways, for example, by helping define the boundaries of what is competitively achievable in terms of ARPU and downlink speed offerings. The implications of these results for satellite operators and investor are that they delineate the pathways to financial success or failure and the boundary conditions beyond which an HTS will be value-negative.

TI  - Applying A Projection Pursuit Model For Evaluation Of Ecological Quality In Jiangxi Province, China
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Monitoring and evaluating ecological quality and changes are crucial for policy formulation to guide ecosystem management and socioeconomic sustainable development. However, evaluation of ecological quality is still very challenging due to difficulties in determination of its associated indicators and weights. This paper proposes supporting, providing and regulating ecosystems services-based indicators to describe ecological quality, and applies a Projection Pursuit Model to eliminate redundant indicators and objectively determine weights for an ecological quality index (EQI) on a regional scale. Taking Jiangxi Province, China, as a demonstration area, the data for indicator measures were retrieved from satellite remote sensing and ecosystem modelling with a spatial resolution of 1 km for the three years 2005, 2010 and 2015. The results suggest that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and water use efficiency (WUE) should be weighed higher and leaf area index (LAI) and Bowen ratio should be weighed lowest in the calculation of an EQI for Jiangxi Province. For 2015, the regional EQI was calculated to be 55.32 on a scale from 0 as the worst to 100 as the best, with higher values ascribed to the hills and mountains and the lower values existing near urban areas. The EQI increased from 52.26 in 2005 to 55.32 in 2015 with an increased area of good-and-above grade from 25.47\% to 36.8\% for the whole province. The changes in EQI could be attributed to a warmer and wetter climate trend playing a positive dominant effect, while urbanization and afforestation have negative and positive effects, respectively. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to evaluate ecological quality based on a comprehensive set of indicators and PPM-based weight determination, which could be further applied in regular ecological quality monitoring and evaluation on the regional, or even the national scale.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Modelling Of A Tropical City: Case Of Kuala Lumpur
JO  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
PY  - 2019
AB  - The steep increase in urban populations results in the spatial extent of cities expanding both horizontally and vertically. The climatic response of urban areas differs greatly to rural areas exposed to the same environmental conditions, with urban temperatures generally being higher, particularly in the late afternoon and evening. Coupled with the upward trend in global temperatures, urban heating can be classified as an atmospheric hazard that affects a high proportion of the population in some countries, which needs to be addressed through local and national government planning strategies. This study presents preliminary findings from a city scale urban climate model developed using the fast climate modelling tool ADMS-Urban for the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is known to suffer from substantial urban heating, and discusses the extent and intensity of the urban heat island in light of existing literature based on field measurements. The model has been configured to use surface characteristic data derived from land-use data as input, and through comparison with temperature variations derived from satellite imagery, the model is seen to clearly capture the spatial variation of temperature over the domain. The urban heat island intensi-ties predicted by the model are comparable to the values reported in literature. This study also demonstrates the strong relationship between temperatures and wind speed, which is generally much lower in tropical Kuala Lumpur compared to mid-latitudes, and the urban heat island intensity and nocturnal cooling. The future modelling studies should account for anthropogenic heating, for instance, from air conditioning units and traffic, which are important sources of heat in tropical areas, and expand more on building materials and morphology for a thorough appraisal of urban heating in Kuala Lumpur.

TI  - Mapping And Characterization Of Phenological Changes Over Various Farming Systems In An Arid And Semi-Arid Region Using Multitemporal Moderate Spatial Resolution Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Changing land use patterns is of great importance in environmental studies and critical for land use management decision making over farming systems in arid and semi-arid regions. Unfortunately, ground data scarcity or inadequacy in many regions can cause large uncertainties in the characterization of phenological changes in arid and semi-arid regions, which can hamper tailored decision making towards best agricultural management practices. Alternatively, state-of-the-art methods for phenological metrics' extraction and long time-series analysis techniques of multispectral remote sensing imagery provide a viable solution. In this context, this study aims to characterize the changes over farming systems through trend analysis. To this end, four farming systems (fallow, rainfed, irrigated annual, and irrigated perennial) in arid areas of Morocco were studied based on four phenological metrics (PhM) (i.e., great integral, start, end, and length of the season). These were derived from large Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series using both a machine learning algorithm and a pixel-based change analysis method. Results showed that during the last twenty-year period (i.e., 2000-2019), a significant dynamism of the plant cover was linked to the behavior of farmers who tend to cultivate intensively and to invest in high-income crops. More specifically, a relevant variability in fallow and rainfed areas, closely linked to the weather conditions, was found. In addition, significant lag trends of the start (-6 days) and end (+3 days) were found, which indicate that the length of the season was related to the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall. This study has also highlighted the potential of multitemporal moderate spatial resolution data to accurately monitor agriculture and better manage land resources. In the meantime, for operationally implementing the use of such work in the field, we believe that it is essential consider the perceptions, opinions, and mutual benefits of farmers and stakeholders to improve strategies and synergies whilst ensuring food, welfare, and sustainability.

TI  - Ramsar Wetlands Of International Importance-Improving Conservation Outcomes
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Ramsar Convention (or the Convention on Wetlands), signed in 1971, was one of the first international conservation agreements, promoting global wise use of wetlands. It has three primary objectives: national designation and management of wetlands of international importance; general wise use of wetlands; and international cooperation. We examined lessons learnt for improving wetland conservation after Ramsar's nearly five decades of operation. The number of wetlands in the Ramsar Site Network has grown over time (2,391 Ramsar Sites, 2.5 million km(2), as at 2020-06-09) but unevenly around the world, with decreasing rate of growth in recent decades. Ramsar Sites are concentrated in countries with a high Gross Domestic Product and human pressure (e.g., western Europe) but, in contrast, Ramsar Sites with the largest wetland extent are in central-west Africa and South America. We identified three key challenges for improving effectiveness of the Ramsar Site Network: increasing number of sites and wetland area, improved representation (functional, geographical and biological); and effective management and reporting. Increasing the number of sites and area in the Ramsar network could benefit from targets, implemented at national scales. Knowledge of representativeness is inadequate, requiring analyses of functional ecotypes, geographical and biological representativeness. Finally, most countries have inadequate management planning and reporting on the ecological character of their Ramsar Sites, requiring more focused attention on a vision and objectives, with regular reporting of key indicators to guide management. There are increasing opportunities to rigorously track ecological character, utilizing new tools and available indicators (e.g., remote sensing). It is critical that the world protect its wetlands, with an effective Ramsar Convention or the Convention on Wetlands at the core.

TI  - Influenza Sentinel Surveillance Network Improvement In Senegal And Results
JO  - Bulletin de la Societe de Pathologie Exotique
PY  - 2015
AB  - Influenza surveillance in Senegal was initially restricted to the identification of circulating strains. The network has recently been enhanced (i) to include epidemiological data from Dakar and other regions and (ii) to extend virological surveillance to other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological data from the sentinel sites is transmitted daily by mobile phone. The data include those for other febrile syndromes similar to influenza-like illnesses (ILI), corresponding to integrated approach. Also, clinical samples are randomly selected and analyzed for influenza and other respiratory viruses. There were 180,192 declared visits to the 11 sentinel sites between week 11-2012 and week 52-2013; 24% of the visits were for fever syndromes and 25% of the cases of fever syndrome were ILI. Rhinoviruses were the most frequent cause of ILI (19%), before adenoviruses (18%), enteroviruses (18%) and influenza A viruses (13%). Co-circulation and co-infection were frequent and were responsible for ILI peaks. In conclusion, it is clear that the greatest advantage of this system is the ease with which it can be implemented, thanks to the availability of mobile phones and mobile phone networks. We recommend this solution for other African countries, because it performs very well and provides rapid benefits in terms of public health decision-making. © 2014, Springer-Verlag France.

TI  - Catch-And-Release And Size Limit Regulations For Blue, White, And Striped Marlin: The Role Of Postrelease Survival In Effective Policy Design
JO  - Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
PY  - 2008
AB  - Catch-and-release fishing as a management and conservation tool for billfish (family Istiophoridae) is practiced in many recreational fisheries, and mandatory release of billfish has been implemented for some commercial fisheries. Inherent in these approaches is the observation that survival of released fish is greater than those that are landed. Recent studies using pop-up satellite tags have begun to quantify postrelease survival rates for billfish, yet the efficacy of management measures that require some or all billfish to be released have not been evaluated. Using an age- and size-structured population model that accounts for individual variability in growth, we simulated the effects of postrelease mortality on yield, risk of recruitment overfishing, efficiency (i.e., ratio of harvest to postrelease mortality), and probability of catching trophy-sized individuals for three marlin species. Regulations such as size limits, catch-and-release, and mandatory release are likely to provide some benefit to billfish populations, but our results show that the effectiveness of these strategies is reduced when release survival is less than 100%. The management approaches most likely to benefit billfish populations are ones that focus on maximizing postrelease survival in the recreational fishery and minimize the billfish catch in commercial fisheries. © 2008 NRC.

TI  - Microwave Remote Sensing Of Flood Inundation
JO  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
PY  - 2015
AB  - Flooding is one of the most costly natural disasters and thus mapping, modeling and forecasting flood events at various temporal and spatial scales is important for any flood risk mitigation plan, disaster relief services and the global (re-) insurance markets. Both computer models and observations (ground-based, airborne and Earth-orbiting) of flood processes and variables are of great value but the amount and quality of information available varies greatly with location, spatial scales and time. It is very well known that remote sensing of flooding, especially in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, can complement ground-based observations and be integrated with flood models to augment the amount of information available to end-users, decision-makers and scientists. This paper aims to provide a concise review of both the science and applications of microwave remote sensing of flood inundation, focusing mainly on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), in a variety of natural and man-made environments. Strengths and limitations are discussed and the paper will conclude with a brief account on perspectives and emerging technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Emerging Role Of Remote Sensing Technology In Emergency Management
JO  - Infrastructure Risk Management Processes: Natural, Accidental, and Deliberate Hazards
PY  - 2006
AB  - The use of remote sensing technology is becoming increasingly widespread at all levels of the disaster management cycle. This paper reviews a number of emerging application areas, drawing on examples from both natural disasters such as earthquakes, and man-made events including recent terrorist attacks. In terms of mitigation and preparedness, remote sensing is making an increasing contribution towards inventory development, hazard and risk assessment and logistical planning. After a disaster has occurred, remote sensing offers a rapid low-risk method of assessing damage to critical infrastructure and the urban built environment. In particular, high resolution coverage enabled the detection of bridge damage following the Northridge earthquake and collapsed buildings following various earthquakes in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Once the initial chaos has subsided, the value of remote sensing data lies in post-event monitoring; tracking changes in hazard location and extent. Reference is made to emergency operations following the World Trade Center attack, where remote sensing imagery supported various response efforts. In terms of secondary applications, details are given concerning innovative new research, using information derived from remote sensing coverage for running traffic rerouting programs, and as a supplementary data source for loss estimation models. © 2006 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Considering the health state assessment of in-orbit satellites in the field of spacecraft health mana-gement, a health state assessment method based on quantitative health degree calculated by fuzzy variable weight theory is proposed and applied to the assessment of the satellite attitude control system (ACS). First, on the component level, a health degree calculation method based on fuzzy dimensionless function and stable update process is presented. And then, on the system level, an improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with the variable weight synthesizing principle is used for establishing the analytic hierarchy model of ACS health state, and the assessment calculation is also given. Finally, the state analysis and assessment method is verified by means of fault simulation, and the results show that it has practical value for satellite health management.

AB  - Despite national and international efforts, malaria remains a major public health problem and the fight to control the disease is confronted by numerous hurdles. Study of space and time dynamics of malaria is necessary as a basis for making appropriate decision and prioritizing intervention including in areas where field data are rare and sanitary information systems are inadequate. Evaluation of malarial risk should also help anticipate the risk of epidemics as a basis for early warning systems. Since 1960-70 civilian satellites launched for earth observation have been providing information for the measuring or evaluating geo-climatic and anthropogenic factors related to malaria transmission and burden. Remotely sensed data gathered for several civilian or military studies have allowed setup of entomological, parasitological, and epidemiological risk models and maps for rural and urban areas. Mapping of human populations at risk has also benefited from remotely sensing. The results of the published studies show that remote sensing is a suitable tool for optimizing planning, efficacy and efficiency of malaria control.

TI  - Essential Biodiversity Change Indicators For Evaluating The Effects Of Anthropocene In Ecosystems At A Global Scale
JO  - History, Philosophy and Theory of the Life Sciences
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding and predicting the impact of global change drivers on biodiversity, the basis of the delivery of goods and services to humans, is a critical task in the Anthropocene Era. This has led to the development of international monitoring networks and frameworks to evaluate changes in biodiversity, the Essential Biodiversity Variables, though still somewhat ineffective. Biodiversity drivers have changed their relative importance in time and space, e.g. due to policies to combat air pollution, the increasing nitrogen pollution or climate change. Hence, to monitor their impact on biodiversity in space and time, we need appropriate Biodiversity Change Indicators and Surrogates, measured through distinct metrics. In this chapter, we propose a conceptual model to select the most cost-effective metrics of biodiversity-change based on both the type and intensity of the drivers that limit or impact biodiversity, and the nature of the Essential Biodiversity Variables which may be affected in each case. We propose ecophysiology-based metrics for low intensity limiting/impacting drivers, affecting organisms’ individual performance; trait-based metrics for medium intensity drivers, affecting the ecological performance of sensitive species before tolerant ones, changing species abundance and community functional traits; taxonomic-based metrics for high driver intensities which may culminate in species loss. We further discuss the utility of remote sensing data to measure some of these indicators or surrogates, allowing to upscale and/or generalize spatial and temporal information. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Of China Using Multi-Source Data And Ensemble Learning
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Large-scale surface soil moisture (SSM) distribution is very necessary for agricultural drought monitoring, water resource management, and climate change research. However, the current large-scale SSM products have relatively coarse spatial resolution, which limits their application. In this study, we estimate the 1 km daily SSM in China based on ensemble learning using a multi-source data set including in situ soil moisture measurements from 2980 meteorological stations, MODIS Surface Reflectance products, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture products, ERA5-Land dataset, SRTM DEM and soil texture. Among them, in situ measurements are used as independent variables, and other data are used as dependent variables. In order to improve the spatio-temporal completeness of SSM, the missing value in SMAP soil moisture products were reconstructed using the Discrete Cosine Transformation-penalized Partial Least Square (DCT-PLS) method to provide spatially complete background field information for soil moisture retrieval. The results show that the reconstructed soil moisture value has high quality, and the DCT-PLS method can fully utilize the three-dimensional spatiotemporal information to fill the data gaps. Subsequently, the performance of four ensemble learning models of random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) for soil moisture retrieval was evaluated. The LightGBM outperformed the other three machine learning models, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.88, a bias of 0.0004 m(3)/m(3), and an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.0366 m(3)/m(3). The high correlation between the in situ soil moisture and the predicted values at each meteorological station further indicate that LightGBM can well capture the temporal variation of soil moisture. Finally, the model was used to map the 1 km daily SSM in China on the first day of each month from May to October 2018. This study can provide some reference and help for future long-term daily 1 km surface soil moisture mapping in China.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation Of Grassland Using Public Copernicus Satellite Radar Sentinel-1
JO  - 3rd EAGE Global Energy Transition, GET 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - Soil moisture directly affects yields and benefits of grassland. Therefore, monitoring soil moisture is essential to understand environmental footprint of grass. The relevant work helps decision-makers, for example, to handle the escalation of global food crisis. Remote sensing techniques are widely applied to the long-term monitoring task of an extensive area. Among them, satellite radars provide a global visibility in cloud-covered areas day and night. Our study aims to predict the soil moisture of a specific grassland based on water cloud model (WCM) and satellite radar data. Compared with previous works, our modelling demands only moisture records and dual-polarization radar data; the extra field work for model calibration is spared thanks to rigorous data collection and processing. We tested our approach using Sentinel-1 data in two cases of grassland around 50 km northwest of Berlin. In validation, the correlations are 0.87 and 0.93; the mean absolute errors are 3.92 % and 2.29 %. We also checked the model transferability between the two grasslands. The correlation and mean absolute error are 0.92 and 4.47 %; 0.85 and 5.32 % vice versa. Our result shows a prospect of training a model at low cost for a global use. © EAGE Global Energy Transition, GET 2022.All rights reserved.

TI  - Current Status Of Mri For The Diagnosis, Staging And Prognosis Of Prostate Cancer: Implications For Focal Therapy And Active Surveillance
JO  - Current Opinion in Urology
PY  - 2009
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current status of MRI techniques in identification of organ-confined prostate cancer with a focus on their implication for focal therapy and active surveillance. RECENT FINDINGS: MRI is currently focusing on intraprostatic prostate cancer identification and at 1.5T, it provides excellent imaging of the whole gland including the challenging anterior part. Improvements in accuracy for cancer detection and volume estimation result from dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI sequences. 3T MRI might improve cancer identification. Histological correlations showed high sensitivity and specificity for significant volume cancers larger than 0.5 cm. Important knowledge on modelling of cancer morphology such as zone of origin and intraprostatic patterns of spread at histopathology was made available for imaging interpretation and treatment planning decision. MRI results allow focused use of biopsy which led to better cancer characterization such as extent and grade. Ongoing focal therapy protocols and active surveillance treatments should benefit from these imaging advances. SUMMARY: At present, high-resolution MRI with pelvic coil appears to offer the most readily available and useful imaging. Future studies should work towards helping define standard, reproducible approaches to imaging and image reporting for research and clinical practice. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

TI  - Benefits Of Large Healthcare Databases For Drug Risk Research
JO  - Bundesgesundheitsblatt - Gesundheitsforschung - Gesundheitsschutz
PY  - 2015
AB  - Large electronic healthcare databases have become an important worldwide data resource for drug safety research after approval. Signal generation methods and drug safety studies based on these data facilitate the prospective monitoring of drug safety after approval, as has been recently required by EU law and the German Medicines Act. Despite its large size, a single healthcare database may include insufficient patients for the study of a very small number of drug-exposed patients or the investigation of very rare drug risks. For that reason, in the United States, efforts have been made to work on models that provide the linkage of data from different electronic healthcare databases for monitoring the safety of medicines after authorization in (i) the Sentinel Initiative and (ii) the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). In July 2014, the pilot project Mini-Sentinel included a total of 178 million people from 18 different US databases. The merging of the data is based on a distributed data network with a common data model. In the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCEPP) there has been no comparable merging of data from different databases; however, first experiences have been gained in various EU drug safety projects. In Germany, the data of the statutory health insurance providers constitute the most important resource for establishing a large healthcare database. Their use for this purpose has so far been severely restricted by the Code of Social Law (Section 75, Book 10). Therefore, a reform of this section is absolutely necessary. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Estimating The Grassland Aboveground Biomass Based On Remote Sensing Data And Machine Learning Algorithm
JO  - Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology
PY  - 2023
AB  - As an important part of the natural ecosystem，grassland ecosystem provides important grazing resources for the development of livestock economy and plays a very important role in regulating climate change and maintains the balance of the ecosystem. Aboveground biomass（AGB）is an important indicator of the physiological state of grassland vegetation. Its size reflects the level of primary productivity of grassland，and is an important indicator of the energy cycle and material flow in grassland ecosystem，and plays an important role in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystem. In recent decades，along with the rapid development of the livestock economy and global warming，the stability of grassland ecosystem has been reduced，the ecological environment has been degraded，and the aboveground biomass and carbon sequestration capacity of grassland are bound to be affected. Large-scale，dynamic and high-precision monitoring of aboveground biomass in grassland is of great importance to the accounting of grassland carbon stocks and the sustainable development of animal husbandry，and remote sensing technology，with its high spatial and temporal detection capability，provides the solution. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in various research fields due to their superiority，efficiency，robustness and accuracy，and the use of machine learning algorithms for rapid，accurate and large-scale monitoring of grassland aboveground biomass is currently a hot research topic. As a result，the construction of an accurate aboveground biomass estimation model，the accurate estimation of aboveground biomass and the analysis of its spatial distribution characteristics can effectively measure the stability of grassland ecosystem and maintain the sustainable development and use of grassland ecological resources，providing a basis for the sustainable use and scientific management of grassland resources in the region，which is of great significance to the ecological security protection and sustainable development of animal husbandry in the region. In this study，the above ground biomass data of grassland in Xinghai County，Qinghai Province was used as the study area，and the random forest（RF）and extreme gradient boosting（XGBoost）methods were used to combine remote sensing data，climate data，topographic data and soil data with high spatial resolution. The aboveground biomass estimation models of grassland in Xinghai County were constructed，and the accuracy of the two models was evaluated using two accuracy verification indicators，namely R2 and root mean square error（RMSE），to achieve high accuracy simulation and mapping of aboveground biomass of grassland and analyze its spatial distribution pattern. The results show that：（1）the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimation in grassland based on the XGBoost model（R2=0. 75，RMSE=44. 64）was higher than the simulation accuracy of RF（R2=0. 72，RMSE=46. 36），and the aboveground biomass estimated by the XGBoost model was closer to the measured above-ground biomass values in grassland；（2）the spatial distribution of grassland aboveground biomass data estimated by the two machine learning models was similar to that of the measured grassland aboveground biomass，with high values of grassland aboveground biomass in the eastern part of the study area and the lowest values of grassland aboveground biomass in the western part，but the model simulations could better reveal the spatial heterogeneity of grassland aboveground biomass distribution；（3）in terms of spatial distribution characteristics，the XGBoost model estimated more detailed spatial variation in aboveground biomass of grassland，especially in the eastern part of the study area. Based on two machine learning algorithms，this study achieved high-precision（30 m spatial resolution）estimation and digital mapping of aboveground biomass in grasslands and analysed their spatial distribution patterns，which can provide scientific basis for monitoring grassl nd ecosystem and sustainable use of grassland resources，and is of great theoretical and practical significance for maintaining ecosystem balance and predicting the impact of future climate change on grassland ecosystem. © The Author(s) 2023.

TI  - A Method For Interval Prediction Of Satellite Battery State Of Health Based On Sample Entropy
JO  - IEEE ACCESS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Satellites need batteries to provide energy when operating in shadow regions, and lithium-ion batteries have become the batteries of choice for most satellites due to their high energy density, low self-discharge rate, and long cycle life. When a satellite battery is working in outer space, its capacity will gradually decrease as the number of cycles increases, and a certain degree of capacity recovery will occur. Due to the excellent mapping relationship between the discharge cutoff voltage and the capacity degradation of lithium-ion batteries and the fact that the sample entropy (SampEn) can sensitively capture local fluctuations, such as the recovery effect during lithium-ion battery capacity degradation, a method for interval prediction of the satellite battery state of health (SOH) based on SampEn was proposed. This method adopts a neural network model based on lower upper bound estimation (LUBE). The method uses the discharge cutoff voltage and the discharge voltage SampEn as the inputs and the battery SOH as the output for the neural network model. To improve the prediction interval coverage and reduce the prediction interval width, especially considering that the lower bound of the interval prediction often determines whether the satellite battery output power reaches the warning threshold, a modified comprehensive indicator function, the coverage width-based criterion (CWC), was constructed. Additionally, based on the nondifferentiability of this indicator function, a simulated annealing algorithm was used to optimize the neural network; at the same time, the optimal values of the interval coverage and interval width were taken into account, resulting in the lower bound of the prediction interval being closer to the actual value. Finally, test data from a NASA 18 battery were used to validate, analyze and verify the interval prediction algorithm proposed in this paper. The results were compared with those obtained from a support vector machine (SVM)-based interval prediction method.

TI  - How Does Agricultural Management Modify Ecosystem Services In The Argentine Pampas? The Effects On Soil C Dynamics
JO  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2012
AB  - Crop management modifies the structure and functioning of the ecosystems. C dynamics has been identified as a key intermediate or support ecosystem service that is profoundly altered by agricultural practices. The temperate grasslands of Argentina, the Pampas, are one of the main crop production regions of the world. Crop sequence, tillage and fertilization change inputs and outputs and, consequently the whole C dynamics. Our objectives in this article were (i) to provide a spatially explicit characterization, based on remotely sensed data, of crop sequences and tillage systems in the Rolling Pampas, (ii) to evaluate changes in C gains by computing the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) from NDVI data of different crop, (iii) to evaluate the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of different management schemes (crop sequence, conventional tillage vs. no till and three levels of nitrogen fertilization) using the CENTURY model, and (iv) to estimate the changes in SOC at a regional level. The results showed that 54\% of the area was under continuous agriculture, with only two crop rotations occupying 61\% of the area, and the main tillage system was no-tillage (73\% of the area analyzed). Annual APAR was lower in crops than in rangelands, except for wheat-soybean double crop. Based on CENTURY simulations the crop management which had a most negative SOC balance (SOC reference value (100\%) = 79 t ha(-1)) was crop sequence "maize/soybean" under conventional tillage and with no fertilizer application (37\% losses of SOC in 60 years). The management that presented the most positive SOC balance was "soybean/wheat-soybean double crop (6 years) pasture (4 years)" under no till and with high fertilization (10\% increase of SOC in 60 years). A positive and linear relationship was found between APAR estimates derived from satellite data and simulated SOC providing basis for a quantitative hypothesis on the importance of C inputs on SOC's dynamics. At regional scale, if crop sequences proportions remain constant, the lost of SOC would average a 15\% in 60 years. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Qualitative Analysis Of Emergency Medical Services (Ems) Personnel Experiences And Perceptions Responding To Drug Overdoses In The United States (Us) During The Covid-19 Pandemic
JO  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH RESEARCH
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background: The purpose of this work was to describe the experiences of EMS personnel in responding to drug overdose-related calls and the impact the pandemic has had to help better inform current response and treatment efforts. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 99 EMS personnel across 18 areas throughout the United States that were designated as Early Warning Network sentinel sites by the National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded National Drug Early Warning System. Participants were asked about topics including the potential burdens from the pandemic and the opioid crisis. We coded the interview responses and identified themes through qualitative analysis. Multiple cycles of descriptive coding, recoding, subcoding, pattern-coding, and thematic coding of responses were conducted. Results: Responses were categorized into the following themes: 1) being over-worked from increased call volume; 2) increased risk for personal harm when responding to patients; 3) compassion fatigue due to long hours and repeat calls for the same people; 4) conflicting perceptions of the utility of naloxone; 5) the need for better treatment options to respond to opioid crisis on top of COVID-19. Conclusions: The burden of the substance use disorder (SUD) crisis on EMS personnel has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reports from EMS personnel throughout the US can help inform policy and procedures to better protect the mental health of EMS personnel and to ensure better care for patients with SUD. These experiences and recommendations may be of use for other countries as substance use and COVID-19 are global health issues.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Assessment Of Land Deformation As A Factor Contributing To Relative Sea Level Rise In Coastal Urban And Natural Protected Areas Using Multi-Source Earth Observation Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - The rise in sea level is expected to considerably aggravate the impact of coastal hazards in the coming years. Low-lying coastal urban centers, populated deltas, and coastal protected areas are key societal hotspots of coastal vulnerability in terms of relative sea level change. Land deformation on a local scale can significantly affect estimations, so it is necessary to understand the rhythm and spatial distribution of potential land subsidence/uplift in coastal areas. The present study deals with the determination of the relative vertical rates of the land deformation and the sea-surface height by using multi-source Earth observation-synthetic aperture radar (SAR), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), tide gauge, and altimetry data. To this end, the multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR) technique was used in order to exploit the most recent Copernicus Sentinel-1 data. The products were set to a reference frame by using GNSS measurements and were combined with a re-analysis model assimilating satellite altimetry data, obtained by the Copernicus Marine Service. Additional GNSS and tide gauge observations have been used for validation purposes. The proposed methodological approach has been implemented in three pilot cases: the city of Alexandroupolis in the Evros Delta region, the coastal zone of Thermaic Gulf, and the coastal area of Killini, Araxos (Patras Gulf) in the northwestern Peloponnese, which are Greek coastal areas with special characteristics. The present research provides localized relative sea-level estimations for the three case studies. Their variation is high, ranging from values close to zero, i.e., from 5-10 cm and 30 cm in 50 years for urban areas to values of 50-60 cm in 50 years for rural areas, close to the coast. The results of this research work can contribute to the effective management of coastal areas in the framework of adaptation and mitigation strategies attributed to climate change. Scaling up the proposed methodology to a continental level is required in order to overcome the existing lack of proper assessment of the relevant hazard in Europe.

TI  - Tourism And Economic Development Three Tools Of Analysis
JO  - TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH
PY  - 2009
AB  - Increasingly, developing countries are embracing international tourism as a source of economic growth. Tourism is one of the world's largest economic activities. It is the leading industry in many countries, as well as a substantial source of job creation worldwide. In recent years, three tools of analysis have become available to inform tourism policy-making by destination managers and planners: the Tourism and Travel Competitiveness Index, Tourism Satellite Accounts, and Computable General Equilibrium models. These tools perform different functions which together provide insights into the competitive strengths and weaknesses of a destination, the economic contribution of tourism to the economy, and the economy-wide impacts of changes in tourism demand. Unfortunately, it is not always the case that destinations most in need of the benefits that such tools can provide have employed them in policy formulation. At the same time, tourism researchers have not always appreciated the different uses to which such tools can be put. The paper discusses the nature of each tool and their importance to policy, planning and the development of tourism, with particular emphasis on lesser developed economies.

PY  - 1997
AB  - The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) developed a decision support system to help utilities coordinate power and reservoir system operations while protecting water quality, meeting water supply needs, and managing reservoir levels. TERRA provides a common set of historical, current, and forecast data to assist in rapidly resolving problems in the operation, forecasting, and planning of the power and reservoir systems. The TERRA database contains current power and reservoir system constraints, commitments, and guidelines that guide daily reservoir operations. Site-specific numerical forecasting models are integrated into the system. TERRA permits the user to apply non-resident models in conjunction with the decision support system. Special care was taken in the development of TERRA to allow tailoring of the decision support system framework to the needs of any power utility or water resource agency.

TI  - Habitat Quality Assessment Using Weights-Of-Evidence Based Gis Modelling: The Case Of Picoides Tridactylus As Species Indicator Of The Biodiversity Value Of The Finnish Forest
JO  - Ecological Modelling
PY  - 2006
AB  - Biodiversity issues have gained importance in forestry as a result of the increased awareness of forest landscape changes, but still there is much to do before forest management meets reasonable goals for forest protection and renewal of biodiversity. In this work, we focus on boreal forest landscapes, using Finland as a case study, and taking advantage of a valuable database-the National Forest Inventory (NFI). We explore a multicriteria approach by using a predictive habitat suitability model for three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) based on Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) and a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multisource Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The WofE model is a quantitative method used for combining evidence to examine the support for a given hypothesis. WofE involves the estimation of a response variable (favourability for certain habitat occurrence) and a set of predictor variables (e.g. GIS layers containing environmental variables). WofE is based on a log-linear form of Bayes' rule and uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Very few examples exist of WofE being used to predict the spatial distribution of species or communities using biophysical descriptors. This work explores WofE as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment using georeferenced species information. Since the method is dependent of the indicator species used as a surrogate of biodiversity value it can be applied for assessing biodiversity conditions of both managed and protected areas to help decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats. Thus, the map of habitat suitability, represented as a range of probabilities of occurrence, offers an objective framework for evaluating the outcomes of different scenarios. Similarly, an objective assessment of habitat suitability provides a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can Magnetic Resonance Imaging Be Used To Select Patients For Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy In Prophylactic Mastectomy?
JO  - CANCER
PY  - 2008
AB  - BACKGROUND. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the setting of prophylactic mastectomy (PM) remains controversial. In the current study, recent experience with PM was described and the value of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was analyzed in selecting patients for PM with or without SLNB. METHODS. Between January 1999 and January 2006, 529 patients underwent 613 PMs. Both preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SLNB were performed selectively at the discretion of the surgeon. RESULTS. occult cancer was identified in 33 of 613 PMs (5\%) (10 invasive and 23 ductal carcinoma in situ cases). PM with SLNB was performed in 393 of 529 patients (74\%), 178 of whom underwent MRI. Of these, occult cancer was found in 6 of 178 patients (3\%), all of whom had negative SLNB. Preoperative MRI was concordant with PM in 4 of 6 cases with occult carcinoma. The remaining 215 of 393 patients (55\%) underwent PM with SLNB without MRI. Occult cancer was found in 18 of 215 patients (8\%); 3 had positive SLNB. Overall, PM with SLNB spared 4 of 393 patients (1\%) from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Among 136 patients undergoing PM alone, 57 had preoperative MRI. MRI detected 5 cancers and PM revealed an additional 4 occult carcinomas not detected by MRI. Overall, 9 of 136 patients (7\%) undergoing PM alone were found to have occult cancer, 3 of which were invasive, raising the decision of reoperation with ALND. CONCLUSIONS. Occult cancer was identified in 5\% of PMs. PM with or without SLNB spared only 4 of 393 patients (1\%) from undergoing ALND, whereas PM alone identified unsuspected invasive disease in 3 of 136 patients (2\%). When performed, MRI accurately ruled out the presence of an invasive cancer in the prophylactic breast, suggesting that MRI can be used to select patients for PM without SLNB.

TI  - Early-Season Agricultural Drought: Detection, Assessment And Monitoring Using Shortwave Angle And Slope Index (Sasi) Data
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Early season or crop-planting-period (ES/CPP) drought conditions have become a recurrent phenomenon in tropical countries like India, due to fluctuations in the time of onset and progression of monsoon rains. ES/CPP agricultural drought assessment is a major challenge because of the difficulties in the generation of operational products on soil moisture at larger scales. The present study analyzed the Shortwave Angle Slope Index (SASI) derived from Near Infrared and Shortwave Infrared data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, for tracking surface moisture changes and assessing the agricultural drought conditions during ES/CPP, over Andhra Pradesh state, India. It was found that in-season progression of SASI was well correlated with rainfall and crop planting patterns in different districts of the study area state in both drought and normal years. Rainfall occurrence, increase in crop planted area, and decrease in SASI were in chronological synchronization in the season. Change in SASI from positive to negative values is a unique indication of dryness to wetness shift in the season. Duration of positive SASI values indicated the persistence of agricultural drought in the crop planting period. Mean SASI values were able to discriminate an area which was planted in normal year and unplanted in drought year. SASI thresholds provide an approximate and rapid estimate of the crop planting favorable area in a region which is useful to assess the impact of drought. Thus, SASI is a potential index to strengthen the existing operational drought monitoring systems. Further work needs to be on the integration of multiple parameters - SASI, soil texture, soil depth, rainfall and cropping pattern, to evolve a geospatial product on crop planting favorable areas. Such products pave the way for quantification of drought impact on agriculture in the early part of the season, which is a major inadequacy in the current drought monitoring system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Patterns, Drivers, And Effects Of Alligator Movement, Behavior And Habitat Use
JO  - American Alligators: Habitats, Behaviors, and Threats
PY  - 2018
AB  - The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a keystone species that exhibits strong top-down effects on both ecosystem structure and function. As a highly mobile predator, alligators can link spatially segregated food webs and influence prey abundance, composition, and behavior across space and time. Therefore, understanding alligator movement patterns has relevant applications to alligator ecology and management, as well as the study of communities or ecosystems across the alligator's range. We provide a brief review that highlights several of the challenges of studying alligator movement patterns. We then describe recent advancements in animal tracking technology that are relevant to the study of crocodilians, including reductions in transmitter size, improved battery longevity and location fix precision, and the ability to pair movement data with animalborne sensor information (e.g., temperature, velocity). Given the rapidly expanding transmitter options now available, we discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks of the major transmitter platforms (radio, satellite, and acoustic) and analytical frameworks, as guidance for future studies. Next, we review the existing literature and discuss potential drivers of variation in movement patterns including demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors, and how they may interact. We then synthesize our knowledge of alligator movement behaviors and discuss their potential community- and ecosystem-level implications. We conclude our chapter by delineating specific research needs that could add both breadth and depth to our understanding of alligator movements, including future studies that focus on adult females and inland or northern-latitude populations, as well as the need for longer-term datasets to evaluate site-fidelity patterns or the lack thereof. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Maintaining Functional Connectivity In Grassland Corridors Between Plantation Forests Promotes High-Quality Habitat And Conserves Range Restricted Grasshoppers
JO  - Landscape Ecology
PY  - 2022
AB  - Context: Grassland corridors are set aside for biodiversity conservation within the commercial timber plantation landscape of South Africa, potentially connecting high value conservation areas together. However, the impact of the production landscape on functional connectivity within these corridors has not been investigated. Objectives: We combine stacked species distribution modelling, functional connectivity analysis, species turnover calculations, and community analysis, to improve our understanding of how grassland corridors contribute to functional connectivity and biodiversity conservation within plantation landscapes. Methods: Grasshoppers, which are reliable indicators of grassland quality, were used as model organisms and sampled within grassland corridors. Remote sensing and machine learning was used to predict functional connectivity and its influence on grasshoppers. Results: Wide corridors along an elevation gradient with different aspects support different grasshopper assemblages and promote species turnover. Sensitive species occur at high elevations with a north-west facing slope in wide corridors that are functionally connected to large high-quality remnant patches. Maintenance of functional connectivity is dependent on the availability of high-quality habitat, which is shaped by prescribed burning, and has a significant effect on range restricted species. Not all high-quality habitat is functionally connected, attributed to exclusion of fire and/or invasive plants, requiring conservation intervention. Conclusions: Prescribed burning should be used to maintain functional connectivity. We recommend less frequent fires, burning every 2–3 years, guided by NDVI. Large corridors at high elevation are priority. In estates with narrow corridors and low functional connectivity, stepping-stone habitats and grassland buffers next to roads should be considered for improved functional connectivity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Modeling Of The Value Of Carbon Sequestration Under Changing Land Use/Land Cover Using Invest Model: A Case Study Of Nour-Rud Watershed, Northern Iran
JO  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - The current paper aims to assess the effects of landscape change in a mountain river basin in the north of Iran through quantifying, mapping, and assessing carbon storage. The analyses were performed based on previous alterations in land use and land cover (LULC) (1988-2018) and on expected changes determined by three LULC alteration setups for 2048. The Landsat imagery from 2018, 2008, 1998, and 1988 was used for evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes. The future LULC image prediction has been generated using Land Change Modeler (LCM) module of TerrSet software for the years 2028, 2038, and 2048. Validation was carried out by overlaying the actual and projected to 2018 map. We integrated the Markov Chain (MC) and InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration (InVEST-CSS) models for simulating the ecosystem carbon storage and the long-term monetary valuation. In this process, we considered social costs/economic value because of the area's loss and gain of stored carbon. The results show that forests and rangelands with good and poor conditions decreased by 631.2, 10,374, and 10,254 ha, respectively, from 1988 to 2018. Overall, modeling and mapping LULC changes showed a descending trend in forests (0.66\%), agriculture (0.1\%), and rangelands (4.1\%) in 2048. In addition, carbon storage has already been lost by 9.9 million tons (76.98 ha(-1)) from 1988 to 8.8 million tons (68.86 ha(-1)) in 2018 and is expected to have an 8.4 million tons (65.25 ha(-1)) loss by 2048. Monitoring the economic value of carbon storage from 1988 to 2018 shows a loss of \$US 15684338 (121.8 ha(-1)) and estimates a loss of \$US6972622 (54.18 ha(-1)) by 2048. Therefore, spatiotemporal design of InVEST model by estimating the carbon value over time focuses on continuous monitoring actions for both the carbon pools dynamic and LULC pattern. This consideration causes reduction the uncertainty of estimated models and also increases the continuous cost of those changes. This will help government and decision makers for long-term and accurate carbon sequestration strategies for ecosystem.

AB  - In view of the small satellite fast attitude maneuver, a satellite control method for fast attitude maneuver and stabilization based on particle swarm optimization (PSO)was proposed. First, this method does the path planning which the initial position of particle population is as the finish time for satellite maneuver acceleration period; then in this path planning the maintenance tracking control was used for tracking, and in the end of the maneuver path, the golden section control and logic differential control were used to make stability control; at last, the time of satellite attitude maneuver to target angle and stable was taken as adaptive value to find out an optimal path in the conditions of this combined control method and other limit to attitude maneuver and stability control. This control method can do optimal maneuver and stability control according to the actual dynamic characteristics, environmental characteristics of the astral, constraints and control performance. Applying this method to the small satellite attitude control, simulation results show the effectiveness of the method. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of Chinese Space Science and Technology.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing For Forestry Planning—A Review
JO  - Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research
PY  - 1998
AB  - This review attempts, from a critical perspective, to put 25 years of satellite remote sensing research into the context of forestry planning. It is limited to temperate and boreal regions and to remote sensing in the visible and near infra-red spectra. It is structured as follows: firstly, the forestry planning problem is defined and information requirements are identified; secondly, the attempts to use satellite remote sensing as an information source for forestry planning are reviewed, divided into the topics inventory and monitoring; and, finally, the methods for extracting forest information from satellite images are re-examined, and their inherent limitations and methodological weaknesses are discussed. It is concluded that satellite images seldom contain enough information to support the decision process in applied forestry. Although regional level applications may be useful, few successful and reliable applications for local forest inventory, planning or damage monitoring have evolved. Stratification for multi-stage sampling and monitoring of clear-cuts are areas in which satellite images have been shown to be feasible. However, it is doubtful whether the costs involved can be justified for such uses alone. A further conclusion is that many studies have adopted simplistic views of the information needs in the forestry planning process. These studies do not relate the analysis to management decisions, but instead assume that plain and approximate mapping of the forest has a great value. Present developments in the discipline involve complex modelling of reflectance, taking into consideration internal shading, topography and other features, yet without dramatic improvements compared with earlier studies. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing and digital image analysis are no longer technologically spectacular, facts which may affect future research in the discipline. It is, perhaps, time to draw the conclusion that current satellite sensors are not in general suitable for forestry planning, since (a) they contain little relevant information, and (b) for forest management planning purposes there are often more efficient ways of collecting the information required. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evaluation Of Historical Drought In The Philippines
JO  - 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future
PY  - 2020
AB  - Negative impacts of drought on agriculture and water resources vary according to different timescales and intensity. In this paper, the historical droughts in the Philippines were examined using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at different timescales (SPI-1, SPI-3, and SPI-12). SPI is derived from the monthly rainfall data of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 v7 from 1998 to 2018. A total of 384 TRMM grids in the Philippines were used in the time series analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought. Results showed that the Philippines was frequently hit by different types of drought. It also showed that the spatial distribution of the past drought events varied through timescales. Particularly, more variation was observed in the entire land area using the shorter SPI timescales, i.e. SPI-1 and SPI-3. With longer timescales, values tend to be more similar and closer to each other resulting in smoother trends. The affected areas in terms of percentage were also examined. Each drought event's severity, duration, and intensity for the areal average of the Philippines was also investigated. These results demonstrate the viability of satellite-derived SPI for drought evaluation at a national level, which is important in the decision-making for drought mitigation in the Philippines. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: "Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future".

AB  - This paper proposes a quantitative method to evaluate the energy efficiency of individual consumption behaviors. Energy consumption is determined by consumption of three kinds of goods: composite goods, car trips and mass transit trips. A model is developed to estimate the individual daily consumption of goods on the maximum utility level. Considering a consistency relationship between the utility level and energy consumption, energy efficiency index is developed to evaluate energy efficiency on different utility levels. We applied this method into a case study in Kumamoto City, Japan. High energy efficiency is found in populated urban area and places with high public transport accessibility. This founding gives robust support for urban sustainable development. © 2013. The authors.

TI  - Assessment Of The Risk Of Disturbance Impact On Primeval And Managed Forests Based On Earth Observation Data Using The Example Of Slovak Eastern Carpathians
JO  - IEEE ACCESS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forests of Slovak Eastern Carpathians provide essential services to society ensuring human well-being. Primeval forests that remained there untouched have exceptional value. Unsustainable logging and climate change intensify forest disturbances and may cause substantial forest loss. The engagement of remote sensing allows timely monitoring and prediction of negative consequences. The leaf area index is selected from the other forest's condition indicators to assess the forests' quantity and disturbance. The conceptual approach for risk assessment of forest disturbance is proposed. This approach uses multiscale multi-temporal Earth observation data, such as synthetic aperture radar imagery and high-level satellite data products. The output response of the forest's condition was restored by multivariate regression with radar backscattering coefficients, relative difference polarization index, and local incidence angle. The low-resolution leaf area index pre-developed Copernicus data products make it possible to characterize the forest's condition without ground truth measurements. According to the elaborated methodology, a time series of the leaf area index was mapped, and risks analysis was performed according to hazard functions. A resulting risk's gradations map is a good tool for future research and decision-making support in nature management. The high spatial resolution of the output maps allows getting a more detailed assessment of forest disturbance behavior.

TI  - Valuation Of Natural Capital Of Region For Increasing Environmental And Economic Efficiency Of Nature Management
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2015
AB  - The application of some simple but historically confirmed methodical approaches for comparable cost valuation of natural resources and services based on the example of partial rent estimation (by absolute rent) for major elements of natural resources capital in rather large and relatively separate ecologically region of Russia – Kamchatskiy kraiy and adjacent marine areas is considered in the report. Economical services of ecosystems and biodiversity of exploited marine fisheries objects are included in natural capital of the region along with traditional natural resources. Methodical approaches used in the investigation could not be considered as comprehensive cost evaluation of natural benefits due to insufficient informational support in the modern Russia. However as the authors suppose these methods provide for more comparability of obtained estimates for various wildlife resources and services. Expanded composition of the object for valuation and increased comparability of obtained cost estimates for various elements of natural capital in the studied region ranked among the major elements of scientific originality of employed valuation and provided for their practical significance that is increased reliability in choice of the most effective strategies for sustainable management of natural capital. © SGEM2015.

TI  - Biochar-Based Water Treatment Systems As A Potential Low-Cost And Sustainable Technology For Clean Water Provision
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2017
AB  - Approximately 600 million people lack access to safe drinking water, hence achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030) calls for rapid translation of recent research into practical and frugal solutions within the remaining 13 years. Biochars, with excellent capacity to remove several contaminants from aqueous solutions, constitute an untapped technology for drinking water treatment. Biochar water treatment has several potential merits compared to existing low-cost methods (i.e., sand filtration, boiling, solar disinfection, chlorination): (1) biochar is a low-cost and renewable adsorbent made using readily available biomaterials and skills, making it appropriate for low-income communities; (2) existing methods predominantly remove pathogens, but biochars remove chemical, biological and physical contaminants; (3) biochars maintain organoleptic properties of water, while existing methods generate carcinogenic by-products (e.g., chlorination) and/or increase concentrations of chemical contaminants (e.g., boiling). Biochars have co-benefits including provision of clean energy for household heating and cooking, and soil application of spent biochar improves soil quality and crop yields. Integrating biochar into the water and sanitation system transforms linear material flows into looped material cycles, consistent with terra preta sanitation. Lack of design information on biochar water treatment, and environmental and public health risks constrain the biochar technology. Seven hypotheses for future research are highlighted under three themes: (1) design and optimization of biochar water treatment; (2) ecotoxicology and human health risks associated with contaminant transfer along the biochar-soil-food-human pathway, and (3) life cycle analyses of carbon and energy footprints of biochar water treatment systems.

TI  - A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines In Infants And Herd Protection In Older Adults In Colombia
JO  - Expert Review of Vaccines
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background: Pneumococcal diseases have a clinical and economic impact on the population. Until this year, a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV10) used to be applied in Colombia, which does not contain serotypes 19A, 3, and 6A, the most prevalent in the country. Therefore, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the shift to the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13). Research design and methods: A decision model was used for newborns in Colombia between 2022–2025 and adults over 65 years. The time horizon was life expectancy. Outcomes are Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD), Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Acute Otitis Media (AOM), their sequelae, Life Gained Years (LYGs), and herd effect in older adults. Results: PCV10 covers 4.27% of serotypes in the country, while PCV13 covers 64.4%. PCV13 would avoid in children 796 cases of IPD, 19,365 of CAP, 1,399 deaths, and generate 44,204 additional LYGs, as well as 9,101 cases of AOM, 13 cases of neuromotor disability and 428 cochlear implants versus PCV10. In older adults, PCV13 would avoid 993 cases of IPD and 17,245 of CAP, versus PCV10. PCV13 saves $51.4 million. The decision model shows robustness in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: PCV13 is a cost-saving strategy versus PCV10 to avoid pneumococcal diseases. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Flexblue®: A Subsea And Transportable Small Modular Power Plant
JO  - International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants, ICAPP 2014
PY  - 2014
AB  - Flexblue® is a 160 MWe, transportable and subsea-based nuclear power unit operating up to 100 meter depth several kilometers away from the shore. The concept is based on existing technologies and experience from the oil&gas, civil nuclear and shipbuilding industries. Flexblue® addresses the energy needs of isolated and small power grids and/or areas with limited available land. Underwater modular nuclear power plants such as Flexblue® present technical, economical and safety advantages as compared to existing onshore nuclear power plants. The full transportability guarantees quick installation and dismantling, with minimal environmental footprint during and after operation. Shipyard manufacturing, reduced civil work and therefore moderate initial investment favor the economics. Above all, underwater nuclear plants offer new opportunities for improving nuclear safety. In a post-Fukushima world, their safety features are particularly relevant. The immersion provides inherent protection against most external aggressions including tsunamis, extreme weather conditions and malevolent actions. The vicinity and the availability of the heat sink - the ocean - enhance the performance of the safety systems which, when designed to operate passively, considerably extend the grace period given to operators in case of accident. The control of severe accident benefits from the submerged environment as well. Despite the very low probability of core degradation, additional defense-in-depth features contribute to practically eliminate the need for emergency counter measures in accident scenarios.

TI  - Review Of Soil Salinity Assessment For Agriculture Across Multiple Scales Using Proximal And/Or Remote Sensors
JO  - Advances in Agronomy
PY  - 2019
AB  - Mapping and monitoring soil spatial variability is particularly problematic for temporally and spatially dynamic properties such as soil salinity. The tools necessary to address this classic problem only reached maturity within the past 2 decades to enable field- to regional-scale salinity assessment of the root zone, including GPS, GIS, geophysical techniques involving proximal and remote sensors, and a greater understanding of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and multi- and hyper-spectral imagery. The concurrent development and application of these tools have made it possible to map soil salinity across multiple scales, which back in the 1980s was prohibitively expensive and impractical even at field scale. The combination of ECa-directed soil sampling and remote imagery has played a key role in mapping and monitoring soil salinity at large spatial extents with accuracy sufficient for applications ranging from field-scale site-specific management to statewide water allocation management to control salinity within irrigation districts. The objective of this paper is: (i) to present a review of the geophysical and remote imagery techniques used to assess soil salinity variability within the root zone from field to regional scales; (ii) to elucidate gaps in our knowledge and understanding of mapping soil salinity; and (iii) to synthesize existing knowledge to give new insight into the direction soil salinity mapping is heading to benefit policy makers, land resource managers, producers, agriculture consultants, extension specialists, and resource conservation field staff. The review covers the need and justification for mapping and monitoring salinity, basic concepts of soil salinity and its measurement, past geophysical and remote imagery research critical to salinity assessment, current approaches for mapping salinity at different scales, milestones in multi-scale salinity assessment, and future direction of field- to regional-scale salinity assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Non-Destructive Testing Method For Early Detection Of Ginseng Root Diseases Using Machine Learning Technologies Based On Leaf Hyperspectral Reflectance
JO  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ginseng is an important medicinal plant benefiting human health for thousands of years. Root disease is the main cause of ginseng yield loss. It is difficult to detect ginseng root disease by manual observation on the changes of leaves, as it takes a long time until symptoms appear on leaves after the infection on roots. In order to detect root diseases at early stages and limit their further spread, an efficient and non-destructive testing (NDT) method is urgently needed. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology was performed in this study to discern whether ginseng roots were diseased. Hyperspectral reflectance of leaves at 325-1,075 nm were collected from the ginsengs with no symptoms on leaves at visual. These spectra were divided into healthy and diseased groups according to the symptoms on roots after harvest. The hyperspectral data were used to construct machine learning classification models including random forest, extreme random tree (ET), adaptive boosting and gradient boosting decision tree respectively to identify diseased ginsengs, while calculating the vegetation indices and analyzing the region of specific spectral bands. The precision rates of the ET model preprocessed by savitzky golay method for the identification of healthy and diseased ginsengs reached 99\% and 98\%, respectively. Combined with the preliminary analysis of band importance, vegetation indices and physiological characteristics, 690-726 nm was screened out as a specific band for early detection of ginseng root diseases. Therefore, underground root diseases can be effectively detected at an early stage by leaf hyperspectral reflectance. The NDT method for early detection of ginsengs root diseases is proposed in this study. The method is helpful in the prevention and control of root diseases of ginsengs to prevent the reduction of ginseng yield.

JO  - Handbook of Irrigation Hydrology and Management: Irrigation Methods
PY  - 2023
AB  - Nowadays, the optimal use of water and its efficient management is the most important challenge in the agricultural sector in many countries. Modern methods have been adopted for irrigating greenhouses and agricultural lands due to the importance of water in agriculture. Agricultural lands and greenhouses can be irrigated at the lowest cost and manpower under smart irrigation systems. Currently, smart irrigation systems can be the best option because of the concerns that most farmers have. There are various techniques that can be implemented through various forms such as the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, neural network, fuzzy logic, and automation. Intelligent irrigation systems regulate irrigation planning without human intervention, in accordance with the climate and soil moisture. These programs and controllers significantly improve the efficiency of water use in irrigation, both outdoors and indoors, such as greenhouses. Intelligent irrigation controllers automatically modify the watering program to the real circumstances of the agriculture, in contrast to traditional irrigation controllers, which work according to a standard and predefined timetable. Each of these main techniques is intended to minimize the need for human interaction and effort. Although each of these approaches has benefits and drawbacks of its own, how each is used sets it apart from the others. This chapter’s goal is to evaluate the actions made to enhance the utilization of water resources. A greater capacity for water storage has also been demonstrated via sophisticated real-time irrigation planning, management, and optimization. The irrigation sector is beginning to deploy remote sensing networks and communication sensors, which is anticipated to increase water use efficiency. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Saeid Eslamian and Faezeh Eslamian; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - Validation Of A Case Definition To Identify Patients Diagnosed With Cardiovascular Disease In Canadian Primary Care Practices
JO  - CJC Open
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. This study validates a primary care-based electronic medical record case definition for CVD. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study explores electronic medical record data from 1574 primary care providers participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. A reference standard was created by reviewing medical records of a subset of patients in this network (n = 2017) for coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Together, these data produced a CVD reference. We applied validated case definitions to an active patient population (≥ 1 visit between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019) to estimate prevalence using the exact binomial test (N = 689,301). Descriptive statistics, χ2 tests, and t tests characterized patients with vs without CVD. Results: The optimal CVD Case Definition 2 had a sensitivity of 68.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 61.6%-74.8%), a specificity of 97.8% (95% CI: 97.0%-98.4%), a positive predictive value of 77.7% (95% CI: 71.6%-82.7%), and a negative predictive value of 96.5% (95% CI: 95.8%-97.1%). Included in this CVD definition was a strong CAD case definition with sensitivity of 91.6% (95% CI: 84.6%-96.1%), specificity of 98.3% (95% CI: 97.6%-98.8%), a PPV of 74.8% (95% CI: 67.8%-80.7%), and an NPV of 99.5% (95% CI: 99.1%-99.7%). This CVD definition also included CeVD and PVD case definitions with low sensitivity (77.6% and 36.6%) but high specificity (98.6% and 99.0%). The estimated prevalence of CVD among primary care patients is 11.2% (95% CI, 11.1%-11.3%; n = 77,064); the majority had CAD (6.4%). Conclusions: This study validated a definition of CVD and its component parts—CAD, CeVD, and PVD. Understanding the prevalence and disease burden for patients with CVD within primary care settings can improve prevention and disease management. © 2023 The Authors

The text shows the benefits resulting from the use of digital analytical tools BIM (Building Information Modeling) and the support of the architectural early design process on light of climate change. Widely understood alternative of design using digital tools in the urban scale enables on the examples of the analyzes and simulation (in terms of shading, the intensity of the exposure surface area covered by the scope of intervention of urban planning) selecting of optimal solutions aimed at the correct use of the potential in the architecture (life cycle context-use) as having impact on climate change. The second part presents, among others, results of the research program undertaken at Riga. The result of the study was to determine the benefits of simulation, ie. conducting urban design process integrating and implementing the digital analysis for future areas (city) in terms of light exposure, sound and wind, taken later to correct design decisions in the architectural dimension. In conclusion emphasizes, that the indicated the possibility of designing the urban area with the use of digital analysis tools, and the direction of the investment process ensure energy self-sufficiency design objects at the urban design stage under of a climate change. © SGEM2016.

TI  - Space In The Service Of Prediction Hydrological Data
PY  - 2005
AB  - The studies of the hydrology of land surfaces by remote sensing from satellite altitudes are more immediately useful than those from surface or low altitude platforms. The scale is increased in hydrological studies, so the physical factors which are involved become less complex. Fortunately, large-scale, low resolution data have considerable scientific and economic value especially for planning the development of the water resources of the world. The Earth Resources Technology Satellite proved particularly useful as a test-bed for experiments with fairly direct hydrological applications. The ERTS Water Resources Working Group was in general agreement that the satellite's MSS observations provided much more useful and readily-applicable hydrological information than had been expected prior to its launch. We will summarize some of the ERTS findings and Landsat inspired suggestions for the future. Weather satellites (Essa, Nimbus and Noaa) have provided interesting data with a hydrological content in thermal infrared wavebands and the microwave region using passive sensor systems. For example, drainage networks have been traced from high resolution infrared data in atmospheric window wavebands under cloud-free conditions at night, when water and the damp soils flanking water courses maintain a higher radiation temperature than the drier interfluves. Quantitative estimates can be placed upon the differences, but by and large the resolution has been too low for the results to be of much practical use except, perhabs in a few particularly inaccessible regions. The new Nimbus Microwave Spectrometer (NEMS) gives more hope for the future. Reflectance patterns may be mapped by such means for soil muisture, snow cover, and ice type studies. The hydrological cycle is comprised of three types of components namely storages, transports, and exchange processes. By far the greatest reservoir of water is the oceanic girdle of the globe, although significant amounts of water are retained temporarily within the rocks of the Earth's crust; in ice caps and snow fields on the surface of the Earth, in soils, in fresh water reservoirs like lakes and inland seas, and in the atmosphere. Water is transported by circulations in the atmosphere and oceans, and by movements over and near the surfaces of land areas chiefly under the influence of gravity. It is left to the exchange processes to effect transformations of water from one physical state (solid, liquid or gas) into another. Microwave systems offer the most immediate description for obtaining data on rainfall intensity as well as distribution. This research will give how the water in the environment can be described with RS and GIS techniques.

TI  - Determining Socioeconomic Drivers Of Urban Forest Fragmentation With Historical Remote Sensing Images
JO  - Landscape and Urban Planning
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urban forests are valuable resources in coupled human and natural urban systems where green spaces are essential in maintaining ecological benefits and services of the landscape. In southern coastal China, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) was established as a new city in 1979 and developed to be a megacity from an agriculture-dominated landscape. To quantify the land-use change during this rapid urbanization process and explore the underline drivers, nine sets of Landsat images from 1973 through 2005 were used to calculate the landscape metrics of forest patches. We found that the forest in Shenzhen SEZ had been restored to 85.85% of pre-urbanization coverage by 2005, but was characterized with smaller, isolated patches across the landscape. The changes in patch density, distribution, and shape during the 30-year study period were nonlinear and defined by episodic periods. The stepwise multiple regression models with socioeconomic drivers provided further explanation for fragmentation rates in patch density, distribution, and shape, with modeled R-squared of 0.837, 0.759, and 0.985 and P-values of 0.011, 0.035, and 0.004, respectively. Among the drivers, urban structure change, industry-related economic booming, and the increase of migrant resident population triggered the urban forest fragmentation while the significantly increased income of city residents drove the de-fragmentation trend. The artificial forestation showed some but a limited role in mitigating forest fragmentation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Valuation Of Ecological Capital Based On The Land Cover/Use Pattern Of Fuxian Catchment In Yunnan Province
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper used TM and MODIS satellite data to map ecosystem types and determine ecological features for Fuxian catchment in Yunnan Province. The remote sensing data and meteorological data were combined to compute Net Primary Productivity (NPP) for different ecosystems in the catchment. Based on NPP values, geographic attribute data and statistical data, the ecological capital of Fuxian catchment was quantified and applied into distinguishing spatial distributions of varies ecosystems. The ecological capital of Fuxian catchment was 8. 278 billion RMB in 2001, 7.995 billion RMB in 2002, 7.035 billion RMB in 2003, and 7.008 billion RMB in 2004. Shrub land made the greatest contribution of the entire value and was the most important part of the ecological capital, the paddy field made the highest efficiency of contribution, and the value of soil-water conservation accounted for a large proportion in the ecological capital. The result showed a trend of gradual decrease in ecological capital. Some important countermeasures about the ecological capital management were proposed in this paper.

TI  - Epidemiology And Cost Analysis Of Varicella In Italy: Results Of A Sentinel Study In The Pediatric Practice
JO  - Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal
PY  - 1999
AB  - Background. Describing the epidemiology of varicella is relevant to the development of specific prevention strategies and to building up of economic models evaluating the costefficiency ratios of these strategies. Aim. Our study was designed to describe the epidemiology of chickenpox among Italian children and to assess the resulting economic and health burden on the country. Methods. Thirty-nine Italian pediatricians participated in a sentinel network on pediatric infectious disease representing a total pediatric population of 30 168 children. Each case of varicella observed from January through December, 1997, was recorded. Economic analysis was conducted from the societal point of view. All costs were broken down into two groups: direct and indirect costs. Results. A total of 1599 cases of varicella were reported among children 0 to 14 years old. There were 1266 primary cases (mean age, 4.5 ± 2 years) and 333 secondary cases (mean age, 3.6 ± 3.2 years). The global incidence of chickenpox was 51.01/1000/year. Complications were seen in 56 cases (3.5%). Drugs were prescribed in 672 cases. A group of adults (364 susceptible and 193 with uncertain status) were exposed to primary cases. Seventy (12.5%) were eventually infected among whom there were 4 pregnant women. For pediatric patients an average cost of $146.90 (250 400 lire) was estimated; this is largely accounted for by indirect costs. Conclusions. The epidemiology of varicella in Italy is consistent with that found in previous studies in industrialized countries. Severe complications did not occur in our population. We believe that the health arguments in favor of universal vaccination of children > 18 months of age do not differ in-our own country from those of other industrialized nations. Our data could now be incorporated into pharmacoeconomic models to establish cost-efficient strategies for Italy.

TI  - Partitioning The Impacts Of Land Use/Land Cover Change And Climate Variability On Water Supply Over The Source Region Of The Blue Nile Basin
JO  - LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water plays a vital role in sustaining the natural functioning of the entire ecosystem that supports life on Earth. It plays key roles in the well-being of society in numerous ways. However, climate variability and land use land cover (LULC) change have caused spatiotemporal water supply variation. Disentangling the effects of climate variability from LULC change on water supply is crucial for sustainable water resource management. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to disentangle the relative contribution of LULC change and climate variability to the overall average annual water supply variation. Residual trends analysis combined with Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) annual water yield model was adopted to perform simulations and disentangle the relative impacts of climate variability and LULC change. Ground and satellite data were used in this study. The study area has experienced a significant increasing wetness trend and significant LULC dynamics between 2003 and 2017. As a result, an increasing water supply was observed due to the joint effects of climate variability and LULC change in the watershed (203 mm). The contribution of climate variability was 94\%, whereas LULC contributes only 6\% from 2003 to 2017. Climate variability negatively led to water supply variation while LULC change contributed positively from 2010 to 2017. Although the ongoing soil and water conservation (SWC) practices improved vegetation cover and water retention of the watershed, climate variability is the main driver of water supply variation. Therefore, SWC practices should incorporate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation strategies and scale up to community-based integrated watershed management to sustain water supply.

TI  - Analysis Of The Spatiotemporally Varying Effects Of Urban Spatial Patterns On Land Surface Temperatures
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are a worldwide phenomenon that have many ecological and social consequences. It has become increasingly important to examine the relationships between land surface temperatures (LSTs) and all related factors. This study analyses Landsat data, spatial metrics, and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model for a case study of Hangzhou, China, to explore the correlation between LST and urban spatial patterns. The LST data were retrieved from Landsat images. Spatial metrics were used to quantify the urban spatial patterns. The effects of the urban spatial patterns on LSTs were further investigated using Pearson correlation analysis and a GWR model, both at three spatial scales. The results show that the LST patterns have changed significantly, which can be explained by the concurrent changes in urban spatial patterns. The correlation coefficients between the spatial metrics and LSTs decrease as the spatial scale increases. The GWR model performs better than an ordinary least squares analysis in exploring the relationship of LSTs and urban spatial patterns, which is indicated by the higher adjusted R-2 values, lower corrected Akaike information criterion and reduced spatial autocorrelations. The GWR model results indicate that the effects of urban spatial patterns on LSTs are spatiotemporally variable. Moreover, their effects vary spatially with the use of different spatial scales. The findings of this study can aid in sustainable urban planning and the mitigation the UHI effect.

TI  - Target-Oriented Habitat And Wildlife Management: Estimating Forage Quantity And Quality Of Semi-Natural Grasslands With Sentinel-1 And Sentinel-2 Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Semi-natural grasslands represent ecosystems with high biodiversity. Their conservation depends on the removal of biomass, for example, through grazing by livestock or wildlife. For this, spatially explicit information about grassland forage quantity and quality is a prerequisite for efficient management. The recent advancements of the Sentinel satellite mission offer new possibilities to support the conservation of semi-natural grasslands. In this study, the combined use of radar (Sentinel-1) and multispectral (Sentinel-2) data to predict forage quantity and quality indicators of semi-natural grassland in Germany was investigated. Field data for organic acid detergent fibre concentration (oADF), crude protein concentration (CP), compressed sward height (CSH) and standing biomass dry weight (DM) collected between 2015 and 2017 were related to remote sensing data using the random forest regression algorithm. In total, 102 optical- and radar-based predictor variables were used to derive an optimized dataset, maximizing the predictive power of the respective model. High R-2 values were obtained for the grassland quality indicators oADF (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 2.29\%) and CP (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 1.70\%) using 15 and 8 predictor variables respectively. Lower R-2 values were achieved for the quantity indicators CSH (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 2.77 cm) and DM (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 90.84 g/m(2)). A permutation-based variable importance measure indicated a strong contribution of simple ratio-based optical indices to the model performance. In particular, the ratios between the narrow near-infrared and red-edge region were among the most important variables. The model performance for oADF, CP and CSH was only marginally increased by adding Sentinel-1 data. For DM, no positive effect on the model performance was observed by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Thus, optical Sentinel-2 data might be sufficient to accurately predict forage quality, and to some extent also quantity indicators of semi-natural grassland.

TI  - Marine Habitat Mapping: Using Alos Avnir-2 Satellite Image For Seagrass Beds At Rabbit (Koh Tonsay) Island, Cambodia
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2012
AB  - The coastline of Cambodia stretches along the Gulf of Thailand including 69 islands. It supports rich diversity of marine species. Distributions of habitats including mangroves, coral reefs and seagrass beds along the pristine Cambodian coast still remains unknown compared to neighboring countries, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodian seagrass beds form habitats with rich biodiversity and economical value through marine ecosystem services playing as a key role against climate change by reserving large amount of carbon. However, the general status of these seagrass habitats is poorly researched and documented. Satellite image of Advance Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (ALOS AVNIR-2) with high resolution (10×10m) provides good information for seagrass habitat mapping. Study site was selected around Rabbit (Koh Tonsay) Island with area of 2 km2. The objectives of this study are (1) to know spatial distribution of seagrass beds around this island by ground survey and (2) map seagrass beds using the ALOS AVNIR-2 image with ground truthing data. Ground truth survey was conducted in June 2011. Surveys along three transect lines revealed 8 species of seagrasses belonging to Hydrocharitaceae (4 species) and Cymodoceaceae (4 species) around the island. We analyzed ALOS AVNIR-2 taken on 22 December 2009 to map distribution of seagrass beds around Koh Tonsay Island. Results showed that remote sensing using ALOS AVNIR-2 data provides a practical tool for mapping seagrasses beds around the island and information for future management and conservation of seagrass beds in Cambodia. © 2012 SPIE.

TI  - Integrating Inland And Coastal Water Quality Data For Actionable Knowledge
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Water quality measures for inland and coastal waters are available as discrete samples from professional and volunteer water quality monitoring programs and higher-frequency, near-continuous data from automated in situ sensors. Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making.

TI  - Clinical Utility And User Perceptions Of A Digital System For Electronic Patient-Reported Symptom Monitoring During Routine Cancer Care: Findings From The Pro-Tect Trial
JO  - JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics
PY  - 2020
AB  - PURPOSE There is increasing interest in implementing digital systems for remote monitoring of patients’ symptoms during routine oncology practice. Information is limited about the clinical utility and user perceptions of these systems. METHODS PRO-TECT is a multicenter trial evaluating implementation of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) among adults with advanced and metastatic cancers receiving treatment at US community oncology practices (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03249090). Questions derived from the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) are administered weekly by web or automated telephone system, with alerts to nurses for severe or worsening symptoms. To elicit user feedback, surveys were administered to participating patients and clinicians. RESULTS Among 496 patients across 26 practices, the majority found the system and questions easy to understand (95%), easy to use (93%), and relevant to their care (91%). Most patients reported that PRO information was used by their clinicians for care (70%), improved discussions with clinicians (73%), made them feel more in control of their own care (77%), and would recommend the system to other patients (89%). Scores for most patient feedback questions were significantly positively correlated with weekly PRO completion rates in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Among 57 nurses, most reported that PRO information was helpful for clinical documentation (79%), increased efficiency of patient discussions (84%), and was useful for patient care (75%). Among 39 oncologists, most found PRO information useful (91%), with 65% using PROs to guide patient discussions sometimes or often and 65% using PROs to make treatment decisions sometimes or often. CONCLUSION These findings support the clinical utility and value of implementing digital systems for monitoring PROs, including the PRO-CTCAE, in routine cancer care.

TI  - Synergy Between Satellite Altimetry And Optical Water Quality Data Towards Improved Estimation Of Lakes Ecological Status
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - European countries are obligated to monitor and estimate ecological status of lakes under European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) for sustainable lakes’ ecosystems in the future. In large and shallow lakes, physical, chemical, and biological water quality parameters are influenced by the high natural variability of water level, exceeding anthropogenic variability, and causing large uncertainty to the assessment of ecological status. Correction of metric values used for the assessment of ecological status for the effect of natural water level fluctuation reduces the signal‐to‐noise ratio in data and decreases the uncertainty of the status estimate. Here we have explored the potential to create synergy between optical and altimetry data for more accurate estimation of ecological status class of lakes. We have combined data from Sentinel‐3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter and Cryosat‐2 SAR Interferometric Radar Altimeter to derive water level estimations in order to apply corrections for chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass, and Secchi disc depth estimations from Sentinel‐3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument data. Long‐term in situ data was used to develop the methodology for the correction of water quality data for the effects of water level applicable on the satellite data. The study shows suitability and potential to combine optical and altimetry data to support in situ measurements and thereby support lake monitoring and management. Combination of two different types of satellite data from the continuous Copernicus program will advance the monitoring of lakes and improves the estimation of ecological status under European Union Water Framework Directive. © 2021 by the authors.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in reducing land surface temperatures. Vegetation indices such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are widely used to examine the relationship between vegetation cover and Land Surface Temperature (LST). In this study, the changes in EVI and LST were determined using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets from 1999 to 2021. The relationship between EVI and LST was also examined to provide a basis for environmental management. The results showed a significant difference in LST and EVI with a negative correlation of -0.22 between them. The LST values increased over the years of study with a maximum of 46 degrees C whilst vegetation cover decreased with a minimum EVI value of 0.20 in 2021. The findings of this study provide useful information to the government, municipalities and other stakeholders to undertake appropriate decisions that can help reduce LST and increase vegetation cover to promote sustainable development.

TI  - Utilizing Lidar Data To Map Tree Canopy For Urban Ecosystem Extent And Condition Accounts In Oslo
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2021
AB  - LiDAR-based segmentation of urban tree canopies and their physical properties (canopy height, canopy diameter, 3D surface and volume) is a replicable, complementary and useful information source for urban ecosystem condition accounts, and an important basis for ecosystem service modeling and valuation. However, using available LiDAR data collected for municipal purposes other than vegetation mapping (such as for example engineering) entails a level of accuracy which may limit the usefulness of the data for change detection in ecosystem accounts. To account for changes in the urban tree canopy of Oslo (capital city of Norway) between 2011 and 2017, a segmentation model was developed based on available airborne LiDAR data scanned for general purposes. The results from the entire built-up area of Oslo indicate a general increase in the number of tall trees (>15 m) and a moderate increase in the number of small trees (<15 m), with the exception of trees between 6 and 10 m which seem to have a relatively constant development over the given period. The total tree canopy area within the built-up area increased by 17.15%, with a corresponding 21.35% increase in the tree canopy volume. The results for the Small House plan area, a policy focus area subject to urban densification and special regulations for felling of large trees, indicate a large increase in small trees (<10 m) and a moderate decrease in tall trees (>10 m). The total tree canopy area within the Small House plan area decreased by 1.04%, with a corresponding 2.13% decrease in the tree canopy volume. With respect to the segmentation accuracy, the changes in aggregate tree canopy cover are too small to determine canopy change with confidence. This study demonstrates the potential for identifying ecosystem condition indicators as well as the limitations of using general purpose LiDAR data to improve the precision of urban ecosystem accounting. For future ecosystem service accounting in urban environments, we recommend that municipalities implement data acquisition programs that combine concurrent field data sampling and LiDAR campaigns designed for urban tree canopy detection, as part of general urban structural inventorying. We recommend using LiDAR and satellite remote sensing data depending on canopy densities. We also recommend that future tree canopy segmentation is done within a cloud-computing environment to ensure sufficient geoprocessing capacity. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - We integrated hyperspectral and field-measured chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data from the Kristalbad constructed wetland in the Netherlands. We developed a best-fit band ratio empirical algorithm to generate a distribution map of Chl-a concentration (Cchla) from SPOT 6 imagery. The Cchla retrieved from remote sensing was compared with a water quality model established for a wetland pond system. The retrieved satellite results were combined with a water quality model to simulate and predict the changes in phytoplankton levels. The regression model provides good retrievals for Chl-a. The imagery-derived Cchla performed well in calibrating the simulation results. For each pond, the modeled Cchla showed a range of values similar to the Chl-a data derived from SPOT 6 imagery (10-25 mg m-3). The imagery-derived and prediction model results could be used as the guiding analytical tools to provide information covering an entire study area and to inform policies. © 2021 Yumeng Song and Jing Zhang, published by De Gruyter 2021.

JO  - AIAA 57th International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2006
PY  - 2006
AB  - The use of geospatial data and geoprocessing technology is critical for surveying and monitoring natural resources (land, water, mine), environmental changes, meteorology, hydrology, and natural, geological disasters; in creating and updating national topographic map system for territorial planning and management; in supporting economic development and administration; in researching, applying and creating new technologies for Earth observation; in implementing programmes, projects, scientific research and technology exchange with different countries, international organizations and private enterprises. This kind of information and its benefits are today an indispensable part of a country's strategic infrastructure for national sustainable development, just as networks for transportation, healthcare, education, telecommunication and water supply systems. Hence it is essential that each country, irrespective of its degree of economic or scientific development, have an appropriate infrastructure and human resources specialized in the knowledge and the application of modern techniques for geospatial data acquisition and processing, culture management and to reach a high level of public awareness of its usefulness in all areas of national life. States conducting remote sensing and geographic information system programmes are called upon to make special efforts to cooperate with other States in building their national space data infrastructure, in the modes considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned. The aim is that all countries should be, as soon as possible, adequately equipped to capture, analyze and apply the geospatial data indispensable for the national sustainable development, as well as for the prevention and mitigation of natural disasters. The paper hereby proposes that this concrete objective become an integral item underlying the principle of internacional space cooperation. It would be, no doubt about it, for the benefit and in the interest of all countries.

TI  - An Integrated Tsa And Io Model For The Estimation Of The Overall Contribution Of Tourism: The Example Of Croatia
JO  - TOURISM
PY  - 2019
AB  - In current conditions in which the activity of tourism is growing, an analysis of the contribution of tourism to the economy and an understanding of the interrelations of activities related to tourism demand are an essential precondition for a successful economic policy. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the role of tourism in the economy of Croatia, using a specific determinist model that integrates symmetrical input-output tables and the tables of the tourism satellite account. The paper starts from an advanced analytical base that enables a more detailed insight into the inter-sector relations of tourism than given by previous research. In 2019 the tourism satellite account became an integral component of official Croatian statistics; the input-output table for 2013 is also available. The methodological framework set up resulted in an estimation of the overall contribution of tourism of a gross domestic value of 16.9\% of the gross value added of Croatia in 2016, in addition to recognized strong multiplicative effect from tourism consumption on non-tourism activities in the economy. At the same time, the imports of direct and indirect intermediate products generated by domestically produced internal tourism consumption generate 6.5\% of the total (goods and services) imports of Croatia. It follows that the tourism contributes more than twice as much to gross valued added of Croatia than its direct and indirect intermediate imports participate in total imports.

TI  - Lake Topography And Active Storage From Satellite Observations Of Flood Frequency
JO  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
PY  - 2020
AB  - Topography is critical information for water resources management in lakes, and remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to estimate topography in ungauged regions. We introduce here a new method that estimates nearshore topography of water bodies based on a flood frequency map and time series of water levels by assuming the equivalence between flood frequency and water level exceedance probability at a given area. Test cases are performed for two lakes and 12 hydropower reservoirs using the proposed Flood2Topo app. This new application generates the bottom level pixel by pixel and level-area-active storage relationship directly from the topography map, without the need to fit functions. Flood extent estimates from the Landsat based Global Surface Water (GSW) data set, the current state-of-the-art, were used to run Flood2Topo, together with water levels from satellite altimetry and in situ gauges. Results show bottom level root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 18.5 and 146 cm for Lake Poopo (Bolivia) and Lake Curuai (Amazon basin), respectively. For reservoir active storage, RMSD normalized values ranged from 2\% to 11\% for 11 reservoirs (average NRMSD of 6.4\%). The method can be applied to any seasonally flooded area using any data set. Considering the surface water occurrence map from the GSW data set, the method is applicable to 35.8\% (86\%) of the global seasonally flooded areas delimited by flood frequencies between 0 and 95\% (99\%) over 35 years. The flood frequency-based method is a promising tool for obtaining data for hydrodynamic simulations and monitoring of ungauged water bodies.

TI  - Who Owns Callan Park? A Cautionary Tale
JO  - Australasian Psychiatry
PY  - 2003
AB  - Objective: To investigate circumstances in which there was: (i) an attempt by the New South Wales (NSW) government to sell a psychiatric hospital site, Callan Park, for private development, without realistic compensation for services for people with mental illnesses; and (ii) a public campaign to pressure that government to give the site to the local community, also without regard to the best interests of people with mental illnesses. Conclusions: On the surface it appears that the debate over Callan Park is over. In the face of a noisy 'Save Callan Park' campaign, the NSW government relented and subsequently passed legislation to protect this site from development 'forever' (Sydney Morning Herald 21.10.2002) amended by the Upper House to prevent long-term leaseholds (December 2002). Both sides of this debate have been misguided, obscuring three important issues: (i) that the site is not 'terra nullius' and does not, as has been often claimed, belong 'to the people of NSW' but 'to the people in NSW with mental illnesses'; (ii) that most people with mental illness are better off being cared for in the community than in psychiatric hospitals; and (iii) that providing such alternative care requires much more government investment, equivalent to the value of such sites. Either selling or giving away psychiatric hospital sites without proper recompense to people with mental illnesses is unjust.

TI  - Small-Area Methods For Investigation Of Environment And Health
JO  - International Journal of Epidemiology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Small-area studies offer a powerful epidemiological approach to study disease patterns at the population level and assess health risks posed by environmental pollutants. They involve a public health investigation on a geographical scale (e.g. neighbourhood) with overlay of health, environmental, demographic and potential confounder data. Recent methodological advances, including Bayesian approaches, combined with fast-growing computational capabilities, permit more informative analyses than previously possible, including the incorporation of data at different scales, from satellites to individual-level survey information. Better data availability has widened the scope and utility of small-area studies, but has also led to greater complexity, including choice of optimal study area size and extent, duration of study periods, range of covariates and confounders to be considered and dealing with uncertainty. The availability of data from large, well-phenotyped cohorts such as UK Biobank enables the use of mixed-level study designs and the triangulation of evidence on environmental risks from small-area and individual-level studies, therefore improving causal inference, including use of linked biomarker and -omics data. As a result, there are now improved opportunities to investigate the impacts of environmental risk factors on human health, particularly for the surveillance and prevention of non-communicable diseases. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Methane Emissions From A Californian Landfill, Determined From Airborne Remote Sensing And In Situ Measurements
JO  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
PY  - 2017
AB  - Fugitive emissions from waste disposal sites are important anthropogenic sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). As a result of the growing world population and the recognition of the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, this anthropogenic source of CH4 has received much recent attention. However, the accurate assessment of the CH4 emissions from landfills by modeling and existing measurement techniques is challenging. This is because of inaccurate knowledge of the model parameters and the extent of and limited accessibility to landfill sites. This results in a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the emissions of CH4 from landfills and waste management. In this study, we present results derived from data collected during the research campaign COMEX (CO2 and MEthane eXperiment) in late summer 2014 in the Los Angeles (LA) Basin. One objective of COMEX, which comprised aircraft observations of methane by the remote sensing Methane Airborne MAPper (MAMAP) instrument and a Picarro greenhouse gas in situ analyzer, was the quantitative investigation of CH4 emissions. Enhanced CH4 concentrations or "CH4 plumes" were detected downwind of landfills by remote sensing aircraft surveys. Subsequent to each remote sensing survey, the detected plume was sampled within the atmospheric boundary layer by in situ measurements of atmospheric parameters such as wind information and dry gas mixing ratios of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the same aircraft. This was undertaken to facilitate the independent estimation of the surface fluxes for the validation of the remote sensing estimates. During the COMEX campaign, four landfills in the LA Basin were surveyed. One landfill repeatedly showed a clear emission plume. This landfill, the Olinda Alpha Landfill, was investigated on 4 days during the last week of August and first days of September 2014. Emissions were estimated for all days using a mass balance approach. The derived emissions vary between 11.6 and 17.8 ktCH(4) yr 1 with related uncertainties in the range of 14 to 45 \%. The comparison of the remote sensing and in situ based CH4 emission rate estimates reveals good agreement within the error bars with an average of the absolute differences of around 2.4 ktCH(4) yr 1 (+/- 2.8 kt CH4 yr(-1)). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported inventory value is 11.5 ktCH(4) yr(-1) for 2014, on average 2.8 ktCH(4) yr(-1) (+/- 1.6 ktCH(4) yr(-1)) lower than our estimates acquired in the afternoon in late summer 2014. This difference may in part be explained by a possible leak located on the southwestern slope of the landfill, which we identified in the observations of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) instrument, flown contemporaneously aboard a second aircraft on 1 day.

TI  - The Joint Center For Satellite Data Assimilation - Formation And Achievements
PY  - 2005
AB  - The Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) was established by NASA and NOAA in 2001, with the DoD becoming a partner in 2002. The goal of the JCSDA is to accelerate the use of observations from earth-orbiting satellites in operational numerical analysis and prediction models for the purpose of improving weather forecasts, improving seasonal to interannual climate forecasts, and increasing the accuracy of climate data sets. Advanced instruments of the current and planned satellite missions, do and will increasingly provide large volumes of data related to atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface state. These data will exhibit accuracies and spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions never before achieved. The JCSDA will ensure that the maximum benefit from investment in space is realised from the advanced global observing system. It will also help accelerate the use of satellite data from both operational and experimental spacecraft for weather and climate related activities. To this end the advancement of data assimilation science by JCSDA has included the establishment of the JCSDA Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and continual upgrades including, the incorporation of AIRS and snow and ice emissivity models for improving the use of microwave sounding data over high latitudes, preparation for use of METOP IASI/AMSU/HSB, DMSP SSMIS and CHAMP GPS data, real-time delivery of EOS-Aqua AMSR-E to NWP centers, and improved physically based SST analyses. Eighteen other research projects are also being supported by the JCSDA (e.g. use of cloudy radiances from advanced satellite instruments) to develop a state of-the-art satellite data assimilation system. The work undertaken by the JCSDA represents a key component of GEOSS. In particular data assimilation, data impact studies, OSSEs, THORPEX and network design studies are key activities of GEOSS.

TI  - Deep Learning-Oriented C-Gan Models For Vegetative Drought Prediction On Peninsular India
JO  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2024
AB  - In this article, the vegetative drought prediction employing Deep Learning (DL) models is designed, incorporating rainfall data and NOAA satellite-data-derived Vegetation Health Index (VHI) values spanning 1981-2022. Correspondingly, two DL-oriented models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): 1) Pix2Pix GAN (P2P) and 2) Bidirectional Convolutional LSTM (BiConvLSTM)-P2P GAN (BiCP2P) are developed over the targeted Region of Interest (ROIs). The assimilation of generative DL models for the application of drought forecasting constitutes a novel investigation and a state-of-the-art approach targeted in this work. Subsequently, the primary ROI designated is peninsular India, and the models. efficacy is validated by implementing it on two more ROIs: the Karnataka and Rajasthan states of India. The proposed models. outcomes are compared with several preferred methodologies quantitatively through Coefficient of Determination (R2 score), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and qualitatively employing drought maps denoting the VHI-based drought severity levels over the ROI. Remarkably, excellent performance is demonstrated by the proposed models over peninsular India, with earned R2 score, MSE, and MAE values of 0.971, 0.0016, and 0.020 for P2P and 0.963, 0.0021, and 0.0239 for BiCP2P, respectively. Moreover, generated drought maps efficiently portrayed the drought severities across the land cover and could potentially be extended further for rapid drought risk assessments. The proposed models functioned outstandingly for the developed datasets on the ROIs, corroborating their potential for similar forecasting applications in other climatic zones, which can aid in better planning and preparedness to tackle natural predicaments such as drought calamity.

TI  - Predicting Solar Radiation In The Urban Area: A Data-Driven Analysis For Sustainable City Planning Using Artificial Neural Networking
JO  - Sustainable Cities and Society
PY  - 2024
AB  - Predicting solar radiation in cities using the Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) is a pioneering step in transforming future-oriented city planning using solar energy. This research harnesses vast datasets to forecast the average annual solar radiation, considering minimal urban information across various urban attributes, including coordinates (X, Y, Z), average height, inhabited and non-occupied areas, and the Azimuth angle. Our method employed parametric design and remote sensing to generate this dataset and then used the ANN model to make predictions and simulations. Urban attributes of 20 cities were examined, including Casablanca, Abu Dhabi, Cape Town, Dublin, Havana, Melbourne, Rome, Singapore, Nairobi, Mumbai, New York, Nagoya, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Madrid, Toronto, Antananarivo, Beijing, Lisbon, and Paris. This data-driven approach trains our ANN model to discern complex and nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables and thus enables our model to predict solar radiation in urban cities. Our data training results indicate that the output (the minimum solar radiation each year of the cities) can be predicted using the study input variables with a loss of 0.01, a mean squared error of 0.01, and an R2-squared value of 85%. Such predictions can refine urban designs of buildings, public spaces, and various urban infrastructures to optimize solar energy use, reducing environmental impacts and fossil fuel reliance, thus aiding climate change mitigation and sustainability. Our findings underscore the integral association between solar radiation and sustainable urban evolution, giving urban planners and researchers sustainable strategies for advancing energy efficiency and ecological equilibrium. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Prioritization Of Sub-Basins Of Gomti River For Soil And Water Conservation Through Morphometric And Lulc Analysis Using Remote Sensing And Gis
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Prioritization of river basin in semi-arid to sub-humid tropical region is important in the context of natural resources conservation and management. In this paper, the Gomti River basin was prioritized for soil-water resource conservation based on analysis of morphometric parameters and land use-land cover with RS and GIS techniques. Gomti River is a monsoon and groundwater-fed river; it is a tributary of Ganga River. The basin has been divided into seventeen sub-basins. ASTER (30 m) Digital Elevation Model data and LANDSAT-8 (30 m) satellite imagery were used to analyze the morphometric parameters and to generate land-use-land-cover data for the basin through supervised image classification technique. The linear, areal, and relief aspects of each sub-basins were determined. Morphometric analysis revealed that the basin is a fifth-order drainage system with a dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. Drainage patterns indicate that sub-surface materials are homogeneous and lack structural control over topography. The circulatory ratio value indicates the basin is an elongated shape. Low values of morphometric parameters indicate good permeability, infiltration, and coarse drainage texture, low relief, and elongated shape indicated good groundwater potential in the basin. The final prioritization result shows that the sub-basin 12 is at the highest priority with the greatest shortage of groundwater potential, so immediate water conservation measures are needed. Contrary, sub-basin 3 is at low priority that indicates the highest groundwater potential. This study suggests the primary priority to improve the water resource management in semi-arid regions at the basin level.

TI  - Height Accuracy Assessment Of Alos World 3d (Aw3d30) Dsm And Its Utility For Identifying Flood-Prone Areas Of Coastal Myanmar
JO  - Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018
PY  - 2018
AB  - The recent release of the “ALOS World 3D” digital surface model (DSM) of 30-meters resolution (AW3D30 DSM), currently at version 2.1, by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) was yet another addition to the globally available medium resolution DSM datasets for users of broad communities in various application fields. The dataset is unique in that it is made available free of charge not only for research and scientific use but also for commercial use in the fields of geospatial information and application. In an effort to test the utility of the AW3D30 DSM in a flat, flood-prone areas of the Ayeyarwady Delta in coastal Myanmar, the author evaluated its height accuracy in comparison with another freely available global digital elevation model (DEM) data of comparable resolution-ASTER GDEM version 2 (GDEM2). The accuracy was assessed using 985 well distributed spot heights from eight 1:50,000-scale topographic maps of Myanmar encompassing approximately 6,000 km2 with elevation ranging 0.1-300 meters. The height accuracy for the AW3D30 DSM resulted in 4.2 m (RMSE) and 3.5 m (Std. dev.) that met its target accuracy of 5 m (RMSE), consistent with other reported validation efforts being conducted worldwide. The height accuracy for the GDEM2 using the same spot heights resulted in 9.4 m (RMSE) and 8.6 m (Std. dev.), also in accordance with the final report by the ASTER GDEM Validation Team in 2011. The results signified the comparative advantage of the AW3D30 DSM among the two datasets. However, preliminary hydrological analysis revealed systematic artifacts of the AW3D30 DSM originating in the number of stacks that had been used to generate the dataset and the AW3D30 DSM proved short in zoning application for flood risk management in the delta region of interest. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018

TI  - Ecological Environment Quality Evaluation And Evolution Analysis Of A Rare Earth Mining Area Under Different Disturbance Conditions
JO  - Environmental Geochemistry and Health
PY  - 2021
AB  - The negative impacts of the overexploitation of resources on regional environments have become increasingly obvious. The contradiction between the environment and development and the management of the ecological environment in mining areas are urgent problems to be solved. This paper uses Landsat images from four temporal phases from 1991 to 2018 in the Lingbei mining area of Dingnan County, China, to construct a rare earth remote sensing-based ecological index (RE-RSEI) suitable for rare earth mining areas and to analyze the impacts of different rare earth mining methods, mining scales and environmental management measures on the mining area environment over the past 27 years. The results show that since 1991, due to the mining techniques of “pond leaching” and “heap leaching” and the soil condition, mining has caused severe damage to the land and vegetation, and the ecological environment quality of the entire mining area has been seriously reduced with its RE-RSEI value dropping from 0.744 to 0.675. After 2010, through the optimization of mining technology and the government’s attention to ecological environmental governance, the quality of the ecological environment was slowly restored, and the recovery effect at some mine sites was remarkable. The RE-RSEI model has good applicability to rare earth mining areas, can intuitively reflect the destruction and restoration of the ecological environment of rare earth mining areas under different mining modes, and provides scientific guidance for promoting the coordination of the development and utilization of rare earth resources and mine ecological environmental protection and sustainable development. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - A 30 M Scale Modeling Of Extreme Gusts During Hurricane Irma (2017) Landfall On Very Small Mountainous Islands In The Lesser Antilles
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
PY  - 2021
AB  - In view of the high vulnerability of the small islands of the Lesser Antilles to cyclonic hazards, realistic very fine scale numerical simulation of hurricane-induced winds is essential to prevent and manage risks. The present innovative modeling aims at combining the most realistically simulated strongest gusts driven by tornado-scale vortices within the eyewall and the most realistic complex terrain effects. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the nonlinear backscatter and anisotropy (NBA) large eddy simulation (LES) configuration was used to reconstruct the devastating landfall of category 5 Hurricane Irma (2017) on Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin. The results pointed out that the 30 m scale seems necessary to simulate structures of multiple subtornadic-scale vortices leading to extreme peak gusts of 132 m s(-1) over the sea. Based on the literature, such extreme gust values have already been observed and are expected for category 5 hurricanes like Irma. Risk areas associated with terrain gust speed-up factors greater than 1 have been identified for the two islands. The comparison between the simulated gusts and the remote sensing building damage highlighted the major role of structure strength linked with the socio-economic development of the territory. The present modeling method could be easily extended to other small mountainous islands to improve the understanding of observed past damage and to develop safer urban management and appropriate building standards.

TI  - Monitoring The Pioneer Frontier And Agricultural Intensification In Mato Grosso Using Spot Vegetation Images
JO  - Revue Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection
PY  - 2012
AB  - Mato Grosso's soybean production has considerably increased in the last ten years reaching 17.9 millions of tons in 2009 (7.2 in 1998). This expansion has led to severe environmental and socio-economical consequences such as deforestation and urbanization. The objective of this study is to assess the efficiency of remote sensing techniques such as NDVI for analyzing the extent of soybean fields in Mato Grosso and the transformation of agriculture in this State. The NDVI was computed from the SPOT-Vegetation sensor on monthly time series (maximum value composition at a 1 km spatial resolution). It enabled locating cultivated areas and monitoring crop growth. It also allowed the detection of the double cropping management practices, which increased drastically in this area for a few years. The results showed a correlation of 0.98 between our estimation of crop areas and IBGE official agricultural statistics for the whole of Mato Grosso. The NDVI time series also confirmed the increase of double cropping systems representing 30% of the cultivated areas in 1999, 57% in 2006 and 67% in 2009. This evolution is an indicator of the agricultural diversification and intensification processes occurring in this region. Moreover, the monitoring of recent large clearings at a local scale (county of Vera) showed a gap reduction between the three successive stages leading to intensified agricultural practices, i.e. forest clearing, first crop plantation and first adoption of double cropping practices. Based on our methodology, we finally proposed a classification of municipalities according to their dominant modes of land use.

JO  - ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study has the main objective to propose environmental indicators for public policies based on spatial distribution of morphometric characteristics and land-use conflicts in municipal areas. The techniques of satellite images in geographic information systems were used to analyze the database of the values of each morphometric parameter of the earth's surface: area, perimeter, length of the drainage system, drainage density, number of channels, river frequency, slope and roughness coefficient and to elaborate thematic maps of current land-use, potential land-use, and land-use conflicts. The data were submitted to descriptive and multivariate exploratory statistical analysis. The spatial distribution of values of morphometric characterization generated environmental physical indicators which enabled the differentiation of areas. The knowledge of the hydrological system in these regions reflects the natural drainage system along its length.The number of channels and the land-use conflicts indicate priority areas for environmental management and land use policies. The morphometric characteristics are potential environmental indicators.

The recent growth in the intensity and number of hurricanes and earthquakes has demanded an increase in the monitoring of landslides. It is necessary to monitor large areas at a detailed level, which has previously been unsatisfactory due to its reliance on the interpretation of aerial photographs and the cost of high-resolution images. Using the differential Bare Soil Index for optical imagery interpretation in combination with cloud-computing in Google Earth Engine is a novel approach. Applying this method on a recent landslide event in Oaxaca in Mexico around 62% of the landslides were detected automatically, however, there is a big potential for improvement. Including NDVI values and considering images with a higher spatial resolution could contribute to the enhancement of landslide detection, as the majority of missed events have a size smaller than half a pixel. Landslide detection in Google Earth Engine has become a promising approach for big data processing and landslide inventory creation. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

TI  - Empirical Modeling Of Leaf Chlorophyll Content In Coffee (<I>Coffea Arabica</I>) Plantations With Sentinel-2 Msi Data: Effects Of Spectral Settings, Spatial Resolution, And Crop Canopy Cover
JO  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2017
AB  - Approaches to monitor coffee leaf Chl are necessary for field, landscape, regional, and national scale decision making to improve coffee stand health and productivity and to reduce yield losses. In this study, we investigated the influence of spectral settings, spatial resolution, and age-related crop canopy cover on leaf Chl modeling performance with Sentinel-2 MSI data. We ran the random forest algorithm to predict coffee leaf Chl using all nine Sentinel-2 MSI bands at 20 m, all nine bands at 10 m, five bands at 10 m, and four bands at 20 m spatial resolutions for all coffee stands (3-8 years, N = 72), and then for mature stands only (5-8 years, N = 60). Results showed that the best modeling results (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 6.8) were achieved when all the bands at 10 m spatial resolution were used inmodeling coffee leafChl for all coffee stands. The prediction accuracy improved (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 5.9) when only mature coffee stands were used. The 20-m bands (red-edge and shortwave infrared) performed similarly in coffee leaf Chl estimation as using all bands at 20 m and using only 10-m bands for all coffee stands and for mature coffee stands. Accuracy metrics were highest and error values lowest when coffee leaf Chlwas estimated for mature stands only compared towhen all coffee stands were modeled. We concluded that Sentinel-2MSI is a valuable dataset for predicting coffee Chl; however, based on our findings, we suggest that finer spatial resolutions of 10 m applied on mature coffee stands should be adopted in modeling coffee Chl.

TI  - Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning-Based Deep Neural Networks For Cognitive Space Communications
JO  - 2017 Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAA 2017
PY  - 2017
AB  - Future communication subsystems of space exploration missions can potentially benefit from software-defined radios (SDRs) controlled by machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid radio resource allocation management control algorithm that integrates multi-objective reinforcement learning and deep artificial neural networks. The objective is to efficiently manage communications system resources by monitoring performance functions with common dependent variables that result in conflicting goals. The uncertainty in the performance of thousands of different possible combinations of radio parameters makes the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning (RL) much more challenging for future critical space-based missions. Thus, the system should spend as little time as possible on exploring actions, and whenever it explores an action, it should perform at acceptable levels most of the time. The proposed approach enables on-line learning by interactions with the environment and restricts poor resource allocation performance through 'virtual environment exploration'. Improvements in the multi-objective performance can be achieved via transmitter parameter adaptation on a packet-basis, with poorly predicted performance promptly resulting in rejected decisions. Simulations presented in this work considered the DVB-S2 standard adaptive transmitter parameters and additional ones expected to be present in future adaptive radio systems. Performance results are provided by analysis of the proposed hybrid algorithm when operating across a satellite communication channel from Earth to GEO orbit during clear sky conditions. The proposed approach constitutes part of the core cognitive engine proof-of-concept to be delivered to the NASA Glenn Research Center SCaN Testbed located on-board the International Space Station. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Assessment Of Water Quality In A Tropical Ramsar Wetland Of Southern India In The Wake Of Covid-19
JO  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus influenced the world severely in the first half of 2020 caused shut down of all kind of human activities. It is reported that a word-wide ecological improvement in terms of air quality and water quality during this lock down period. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the progression in water quality through examining suspended particulate matter using remote sensing data in a tropical Ramsar site viz, Asthamudi Lake in Southern India. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the study area were analyzed and suspended particulate matter (SPM) is estimated from Landsat 8 OLI images. A comparison analysis of pre and co lockdown periods reveal that the concentration of SPM values during lockdown (mean SPM 8.01 mg/l) is lower than that of pre-lockdown (10.03 mg/l). The time series analysis of last five-year data from 2015 to 2020 also shows an average decrease of 43\% in SPM concentration during lockdown period compared to the last five-year average value of 9.1 mg/l. The reasons for improvement of SPM in water quality during the lockdown period in April-May 2020 was discussed, in terms of the role of anthropogenic activities and strategies for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources in the Asthamudi Lake were also presented.

TI  - Ecological Risk Changes And Their Relationship With Exposed Surface Fraction In The Karst Region Of Southern China From 1990 To 2020
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Due to anthropogenic disturbances, the karst region in southern China is vulnerable to ecological problems such as soil erosion and surface exposure. However, limited studies on variations in large-scale ecological risk (ER) and their influencing factors, particularly the coupling/decoupling relationship with an exposed surface fraction (ESF), make ER regulations and ecological restoration challenging. The present study evaluates the ER of eight typical karst provinces in Southern China from 1990 to 2020 using the technique for order preference by sim-ilarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) model and ecosystem services (habitat quality, water yield, carbon storage, soil conservation, and food production), and extracts the contemporaneous ESF using Landsat satellite data in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The spatiotemporal change of ER and ESF are analyzed, and their coupling/ decoupling relationship and driving mechanism are explored using coupling coordination degree (CCD) and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models. The results show that: (1) Over the past 30 years, the ER has increased until 2010 and subsequently declined, with an increasing mean value (0.463-0.503), except in Chongqing municipality. The ESF decreased significantly (the mean value dropped from 44.7\% to 38.7\%), except that in Sichuan province. (2) The average CCD between ER and ESF decreased with fluctuation of-0.017, with a decoupling relationship (58.18\%). The coupling area is larger than the decoupling area in the Sichuan area, while other provinces are opposite. (3) The coupling/decoupling relationship in the study area is mainly driven by terrain (elevation, slope) and socio-economic (population density, per capita GDP) factors. More attention should be paid to the role of these factors in the continuous reduction and control of ESF and ER. This study can serve as a reference for similar studies in karst regions, such as risk assessment and surface monitoring, rocky desertification control, ecological engineering layout, and territorial planning.

TI  - How Do Hospital Administrators Perceive Cardiac Rehabilitation In A Publicly-Funded Health Care System?
JO  - BMC Health Services Research
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: Patient and provider-related factors affecting access to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) have been extensively studied, but health-system administration factors have not. The objectives of this study were to investigate hospital administrators' (HA) awareness and knowledge of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), perceptions regarding resources for and benefit of CR, and attitudes toward and implementation of inpatient transition planning for outpatient CR. Methods. A cross-sectional and observational design was used. A survey was administered to 679 HAs through Canadian and Ontario databases. A descriptive examination was performed, and differences in HAs' perceptions by role, institution type and presence of within-institution CR were compared using t-tests. Results: 195 (28.7%) Canadian HAs completed the survey. Respondents reported good knowledge of what CR entails (mean=3.42±1.15/5). Awareness of the closest site was lower among HAs working in community versus academic institutions (3.88±1.24 vs. 4.34±0.90/5 respectively; p=.01). HAs in non-executive roles (4.77±0.46/5) perceived greater CR importance for patients' care than executives (4.52±0.57; p=.001). HAs perceived CR programs should be situated in both hospitals and community settings (n=134, 71.7%). Conclusions: HAs value CR as part of patients' care, and are supportive of greater CR provision. Those working in community settings and executives may not be as aware of, or less-likely to value, CR services. CR leaders from academic institutions might consider liaising with community hospitals to raise awareness of CR benefits, and advocate for it with the executives in their home institutions. © 2013 Grace et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - The Urban Environmental Indicator "Biotope Area Ratio" - An Enhanced Approach To Assess And Manage The Urban Ecosystem Services Using High Resolution Remote-Sensing
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2012
AB  - The analysis of the environmental situation in urban areas is of higher importance than ever because of the altered urban ecosystem itself and its impacts on ecosystem services for the rapidly growing urban population. A major challenge remains in developing methods to assess and value ecosystem services and integrate them in urban decision-making processes. In this paper, the urban environmental indicator "Biotope Area Ratio" (BAR) is studied. We aim to analyse the benefits and limits of the BAR to assess and manage the urban ecosystem services using high resolution remote-sensing. We choose two urban environmental settings in Berlin and Seoul where the BAR has been already successfully applied. Results show that the BAR as is represents a valuable instrument and augments existing indicators but that there are modifications advisable to address recent challenges of ecosystem services in urban areas. For the successful implementation as a planning instrument we identify the legally required regulation in the planning process and the existence of reliable data as major challenges. The investigated high resolution remote-sensing based approach provides some advantages to map surface types of the urban environment for a first screening, monitoring and evaluation of implemented measures of the BAR and can therefore support existing field mappings. Insights from our study may stimulate developments of explicitly assessing and managing urban ecosystem services using aggregated indicators such as the BAR and may highlight the importance of a more adequate representation of the urban environment in decision-making processes in other cities in the future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluating The Spatio-Temporal Distribution Of Irrigation Water Components For Water Resources Management Using Geo-Informatics Approach
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Spatio-temporal distribution of irrigation water components was evaluated at the canal command area in Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) by using a remote sensing-based geo-informatics approach. Satellite-derived MODIS product-based Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used for the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The ground data-based advection aridity method (AA) was used to calibrate and validate the model. Statistical analysis of the SEBAL based ETa and AA shows the mean values of 87.1 mm and 47.9 mm during Kharif season (May-November) and 100 mm and 77 mm during the Rabi Season (December-April). Mean NSEs of 0.72 and 0.85 and RMSEs 34.9 and 5.76 during the Kharif and the Rabi seasons were observed for ETa and AA, respectively. Rainfall data were calibrated with the point observatory data of the metrological stations. The average annual ETa was found 899 mm for defined four cropping years (2011-2012 to 2014-2015) with the minimum average value of 63.3 mm in January and the maximum average value of 110.6 mm in August. Average of the sum of net canal water use (NCWU) and rainfall during the study period of four years was 548 mm (36\% of ETa). Seasonal analysis revealed 39\% and 61\% of groundwater extraction proportion during Rabi and Kharif seasons, dependent upon the occurrence of rainfall and crop phenology. Overall, the results provide insight into the interrelationships between key water resources management components and the variation of these through time, offering information to improve the strategic planning and management of available water resources in this region.

TI  - Living With Floating Vegetation Invasions
JO  - AMBIO
PY  - 2021
AB  - Invasions of water bodies by floating vegetation, including water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), are a huge global problem for fisheries, hydropower generation, and transportation. We analyzed floating plant coverage on 20 reservoirs across the world's tropics and subtropics, using > 30 year time-series of LANDSAT remote-sensing imagery. Despite decades of costly weed control, floating invasion severity is increasing. Floating plant coverage correlates with expanding urban land cover in catchments, implicating urban nutrient sources as plausible drivers. Floating vegetation invasions have undeniable societal costs, but also provide benefits. Water hyacinths efficiently absorb nutrients from eutrophic waters, mitigating nutrient pollution problems. When washed up on shores, plants may become compost, increasing soil fertility. The biomass is increasingly used as a renewable biofuel. We propose a more nuanced perspective on these invasions moving away from futile eradication attempts towards an ecosystem management strategy that minimizes negative impacts while integrating potential social and environmental benefits.

TI  - Building Asset Value Mapping In Support Of Flood Risk Assessments: A Case Study Of Shanghai, China
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Exposure is an integral part of any natural disaster risk assessment, and damage to buildings is one of the most important consequence of flood disasters. As such, estimates of the building stock and the values at risk can assist in flood risk management, including determining the damage extent and severity. Unfortunately, little information about building asset value, and especially its spatial distributions, is readily available in most countries. This is certainly true in China, given that the statistical data on building floor area (BFA) is collected by administrative entities (i.e. census level). To bridge the gap between census-level BFA data and geo-coded building asset value data, this article introduces a method for building asset value mapping, using Shanghai as an example. This method consists of a census-level BFA disaggregation (downscaling) by means of a building footprint map extracted from high-resolution remote sensing data, combined with LandScan population density grid data and a financial appraisal of building asset values. Validation with statistical data and field survey data confirms that the method can produce good results, but largely constrained by the resolution of the population density grid used. However, compared with other models with no disaggregation in flood exposure assessment that involves Shanghai, the building asset value mapping method used in this study has a comparative advantage, and it will provide a quick way to produce a building asset value map for regional flood risk assessments. We argue that a sound flood risk assessment should be based on a high-resolution-individual building-based-building asset value map because of the high spatial heterogeneity of flood hazards.

TI  - On The Accuracy Of Official Chinese Crop Production Data: Evidence From Biophysical Indexes Of Net Primary Production
JO  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
PY  - 2020
AB  - With rapid economic growth and urbanization, self-sufficiency in crop production has become central to China's agriculture policy. Accurate crop production statistics are essential for research, monitoring, and planning. Although researchers agree that China's statistical authority has considerably modernized over time, China's economic statistics have still been viewed as unreliable and often overstated to meet growth targets at different administrative levels. Recent increases in crop production reported by national statistics have also come under increasing scrutiny. This paper investigates crop production data quality from a planetary boundary perspective - comparing net primary production (NPP) harvested obtained from national statistics with satellite-driven NPP estimates that are supported by detailed observation of land cover, combined with observations on physical factors that limit plant growth. This approach provides a powerful means to check the plausibility of China's grain production statistics at different administrative levels that can generate insights about their discrepancies and can contribute to improved crop production measurements. We find some evidence of potential misreporting problems from the lower administration level where the risk of manipulation of statistics is higher. We also find problems from provincial-level major grain producers. These values can also affect the national totals. Although the numbers are affected by large uncertainties, we find that improving the spatial resolution of key agricultural parameters can greatly improve the reliability of the indicator that in turn can help improve data quality. More reliable production data will be vital for relevant research and provide better insights into food security problems, the carbon cycle, and sustainable development. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Modeling Large-Scale Biometeorological Indices To Monitor Agricultural-Growing Areas: Applications In The Fruit Circuit Region, São Paulo, Brazil
JO  - International Journal of Biometeorology
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper aimed to support the rational crop expansion in agricultural-growing regions. MODIS satellite images are used together with gridded weather data to model biometeorological parameters at the Fruit Circuit region, state of São Paulo, Southeast Brazil. This region has experienced some cases of drought, while arising rainfall water excess in some periods, demanding large-scale water and energy balance studies to subsidize water resource policies. The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was applied together with the radiation-use efficiency (RUE) model for biometeorological index assessments. The highest latent heat fluxes (λE), above 8.0 MJ m−2 d−1, at the end of the year, coincide with the progressive increases on both rainfall and global solar radiation (RG) levels, and drop to below 5.0 MJ m−2 d−1 in the middle of the year, during the driest conditions. The same tendencies along the year are verified for sensible heat fluxes (H), for which mean pixel values are above 3.5 MJ m−2 d−1 at the end of the year. On the one hand, the highest values for water productivity (WP), which is considered the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to biomass production (BIO), above 4.0 kg m−3, are verified in April, period under increasing BIO and low ET rates. On the other hand, the lowest WP values (below 2.0 kg m−3) occur between August and October, when BIO is low, and ET is high. Although the area featuring good WP levels under high precipitation (P), with rainfalls generally above ET, supplementary irrigation may benefit agriculture in some periods of the year. The results of the large-scale modeling showed applicability of the models for monitoring water and vegetation dynamics over 16-day timescale and at a 250-m spatial resolution in areas experiencing climate and land-use changes by combining climate data and MODIS images. Application of these tools enables to indicate the best options for expanding the agriculture activities, being of great potential for rational natural resources management, in regions under environmental vulnerability conditions. © 2020, ISB.

TI  - Temporal Changes In Distribution, Prevalence And Intensity Of Northern Fowl Mite (Ornithonyssus Sylviarum) Parasitism In Commercial Caged Laying Hens, With A Comprehensive Economic Analysis Of Parasite Impact
JO  - Veterinary Parasitology
PY  - 2009
AB  - Establishment and spread of Ornithonyssus sylviarum were documented through time on sentinel hens (50 per house of 28,000-30,000 hens) in the first egg production cycle of three large commercial flocks (12 houses) of white leghorn hens. Mites were controlled using acaricide, and the impacts of treatment on mite populations and economic performance were documented. Mite prevalence and intensity increased rapidly and in tandem for 4-8 weeks after infestation. Intensity declined due to immune system involvement, but prevalence remained high, and this would affect mite sampling plan use and development. Early treatment was more effective at controlling mites; 85% of light infestations were eliminated by a pesticide spray (Ravap), versus 24% of heavy infestations. Hens infested later developed lower peak mite intensities, and those mite populations declined more quickly than on hens infested earlier in life. Raw spatial association by distance indices (SADIE), incorporating both the intensity and distribution of mites within a house, were high from week-to-week within a hen house. Once adjusted spatially to reflect variable hen cohorts becoming infested asynchronously, this analysis showed the association index tended to rebound at intervals of 5-6 weeks after the hen immune system first suppressed them. Large, consistent mite differences in one flock (high vs. low infestation levels) showed the economic damage of mite parasitism (assessed by flock indexing) was very high in the initial stages of mite expansion. Unmitigated infestations overall reduced egg production (2.1-4.0%), individual egg weights (0.5-2.2%), and feed conversion efficiency (5.7%), causing a profit reduction of $0.07-0.10 per hen for a 10-week period. Asynchronous infestation patterns among pesticide-treated hens may have contributed to a lack of apparent flock-level economic effects later in the production cycle. Individual egg weights differed with mite loads periodically, but could be either higher or lower, depending on circumstances and interactions with hen weight. Individual hen weight gains were depressed by high/moderate mite loads, but the heavier hens in a flock harbored more mites. This led to compensatory weight gains after mites declined. Tradeoffs between resource allocation to body growth or production versus immune system function appeared to be operating during the early and most damaging mite infestation period, when high egg production was beginning and the hens were gaining weight. The results were related to other studies of mite impact on domestic hens and to wild bird-ectoparasite studies. Much of the mite economic damage probably is due to engaging and maintaining the immune response. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating Rs Technology Into A Gis-Based Earthquake Prevention And Disaster Reduction System For Earthquake Damage Evaluation
JO  - Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Vibration
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper presents a method to integrate remote sensing (RS) data processing, generation of isoseismal lines and human-computer interaction modules into an improved GIS-based disaster reduction system. Using the RS data processing module, a statistical sample gray value and the RS-intensity at each field survey point in the region are calculated from the probabilistic relationship between the RS-variable and earthquake intensity, and stored in the GIS-based system database. Then, isoseismal lines are generated by a trend surface model from RS-intensity. They are further improved via modification of the isoseismal lines based on the empirical attenuation relationship calculated by using the RS-variable in the human-computer interaction module. The field survey shows that the proposed method gives a good generation of isoseismic lines. As a result, the accuracy of the damage and loss evaluation and the efficiency of the emergency decision making capability are improved. © 2009 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

PY  - 2000
AB  - The scientific community has long embraced the concept of globalized collaboration, recognizing that scientific inquiry knows no borders and that scientific theory transcends nationality. With respect to translating scientific and technological innovation into practical application, however, national, political, and ideological barriers suddenly arise. At a time when the worlds of economics and finance are rapidly globalizing, the world of applied science lags behind - despite increasingly urgent need for global energy solutions. In the context of considering space solar power (SSP) systems, the author contends that these solutions require new ways of determining costs and benefits; that scientific experts should seek active engagement in the policy arena; and that SSP's scientific community has a critical role to play in advocating for consideration of space-based energy solutions.

TI  - Role Of Remote Sensing In Precision Agriculture
JO  - Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems
PY  - 2023
AB  - Over the period of time, weather conditions have changed drastically. These changes have led to many serious issues such as soil nutrition depletion, reduction in soil water holding capacity, and increase in pesticide resistant weeds. Precision Agriculture (PA) is the pioneer that is changing the way people farm, offering benefits in profitability, productivity, sustainability, crop quality, environmental protection, on-farm quality of life, food safety, and rural economic development. In addition, with the aid of the recent advancements in the sensor technology, it can develop into an intelligent crop production system. Specifically, remote sensing technology that allows non-destructive acquisition of information about the earth’s surface can facilitate the implementation of PA. In this paper, a specific area of Punjab is analyzed for crop production using remote sensing data. To increase crop production and make management decisions, PA entails the application of remote sensing technology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Effects Of Live Fuel Moisture Content On Wildfire Occurrence In Fire-Prone Regions Over Southwest China
JO  - Forests
PY  - 2019
AB  - Previous studies have shown that Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a crucial driver affecting wildfire occurrence worldwide, but the effect of LFMC in driving wildfire occurrence still remains unexplored over the southwest China ecosystem, an area historically vulnerable to wildfires. To this end, we took 10-years of LFMC dynamics retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) reflectance product using the physical Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) and the wildfire events extracted from the MODIS Burned Area (BA) product to explore the relations between LFMC and forest/grassland fire occurrence across the subtropical highland zone (Cwa) and humid subtropical zone (Cwb) over southwest China. The statistical results of pre-fire LFMC and cumulative burned area show that distinct pre-fire LFMC critical thresholds were identified for Cwa (151.3%, 123.1%, and 51.4% for forest, and 138.1%, 72.8%, and 13.1% for grassland) and Cwb (115.0% and 54.4% for forest, and 137.5%, 69.0%, and 10.6% for grassland) zones. Below these thresholds, the fire occurrence and the burned area increased significantly. Additionally, a significant decreasing trend on LFMC dynamics was found during the days prior to two large fire events, Qiubei forest fire and Lantern Mountain grassland fire that broke during the 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 fire seasons, respectively. The minimum LFMC values reached prior to the fires (49.8% and 17.3%) were close to the lowest critical LFMC thresholds we reported for forest (51.4%) and grassland (13.1%). Further LFMC trend analysis revealed that the regional median LFMC dynamics for the 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 fire seasons were also significantly lower than the 10-year LFMC of the region. Hence, this study demonstrated that the LFMC dynamics explained wildfire occurrence in these fire-prone regions over southwest China, allowing the possibility to develop a new operational wildfire danger forecasting model over this area by considering the satellite-derived LFMC product. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Diagnostic Testing For The Evaluation Of Headaches
JO  - Neurologic Clinics
PY  - 1996
AB  - Headaches are one of the most common symptoms that neurologists evaluate. Although most are caused by primary disorders, the list differential diagnoses is one of the longest in all of medicine, with over 300 different types and causes. The cause or type of most headaches can be determined by a careful history supplemented by a general and neurologic examination. Reasons for obtaining neuroimaging include medical indications as well as anxiety of patients and families and medico-legal concerns. In the era of managed care, concerns over deselection and negative capitation may dissuade the physician from ordering even a medically indicated scan. The yield of neuroimaging in the evaluation of patients with headache and a normal neurologic examination is quite low. Combining the results of multiple studies performed since 1977 for a total of 3026 scans reveals the overall percentages of various pathologies as: brain tumors, 0.8%; arteriovenous malformations, 0.2%; hydrocephalus, 0.3%; aneurysm, 0.1%; subdural hematoma, 0.2%; and strokes, including chronic ischemic processes, 1.2%. EEG is not useful in the routine evaluation of patients with headache. Similarly, the yield of neuroimaging in the evaluation of migraine is quite low. Combining the results of multiple studies performed since 1976 for a total of 1440 scans of patients with various types of migraine, the overall percentages of various pathologies are: brain tumor, 0.3%; arteriovenous malformation, 0.07%; and saccular aneurysm, 0.07%. WMA have been reported on MRI studies of patients with all types of migraine, with a range from 12% to 46%. The cause of WMA in migraine is not certain. Cerebral atrophy has been variably reported as more frequent and no more frequent in migraineurs compared with controls. The 'first or worst' headache has a long list of possible causes and always includes the possibility of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Headaches-especially the sentinel type caused by SAH-often are misdiagnosed. The probability of detecting an aneurysmal hemorrhage on CT scans performed at various intervals after the ictus is: day 0, 95%; day 3, 74%; 1 week, 50%; 2 weeks, 30%; and 3 weeks, almost nil. The location of a ruptured saccular aneurysm often is suggested by the predominant site of the SAH. The probability of detecting xanthochromia with spectrophotometry in the CSF at various times after a subarachnoid hemorrhage is: 12 hours, 100%; 1 week, 100%; 2 weeks, 100%; 3 weeks, more than 70%; and 4 weeks, more than 40%. The management of thunderclap headaches with normal CT scan and CSF examinations is controversial. Most patients have a benign course but an unruptured saccular aneurysm occasionally may be responsible for the headache. MR angiography may be a reasonable test to obtain instead of a cerebral arteriogram in many of these cases. About 30% to 90% of patients have headaches of various types and causes after mild head injury. Although most headaches are relatively benign, perhaps 1% to 3% of these patients have life-threatening pathology, including subdural and epidural hematomas, that are detected on CT and MRI scans. Headaches caused by subdural hematomas can be nonspecific. When new-onset headaches begin in patients over the age of 50 years, the physician always should consider whether it may be a secondary headache disorder requiring specific diagnostic testing and treatment. Up to 15% of patients 65 years and over who present to neurologists with new-onset headaches may have serious pathology such as stroke, TA, neoplasm, and subdural hematoma. Headaches are the most common symptom of TA, reported by 60% to 90%. The headaches of TA can be nonspecific and can occur in any location, with only 25% only over the temple. The diagnosis of TA is based on a high index of clinical suspicion that usually but not always is confirmed by laboratory testing. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be normal in 10% to 36% of patients with TA. A superficial temporal artery biopsy can give a false negative result in 5% to 44% of patients. As the era of managed c re of medicine evolves, payers may increasingly question the benefit of diagnostic testing for the evaluation of headaches. A careful and complete history and examination enable the astute physician to make the proper diagnosis in most cases without testing. In some cases, however, the nonspecific nature of some headaches with a normal examination demand diagnostic testing even though the yield may be low. Headache diagnosis can be a field of unexpected land mines. Hopefully, the gatekeeper model will not prevent patients with troublesome headaches from obtaining appropriate diagnostic testing and neurologic consultation.

TI  - Functional Urban Land Use Recognition Integrating Multi-Source Geospatial Data And Cross-Correlations
JO  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
PY  - 2019
AB  - The significance of urban function recognition has stimulated the need for multi source geospatial data fusion, especially the fusion between remote sensing images and spatiotemporal big data. In previous studies, the natural correspondence across multi source geospatial data has often been ignored in the description of one object, which would influence the performance of data fusion. Therefore, this study introduces the cross-correlations mechanism to achieve the natural correspondence by taking remote sensing images, point of interest (POI), and real-time social media users as an example. It proposes a new cross correlations based functional urban land use (CC-FLU) model to infer urban functions. The presented model extracts physical and human semantic features from multi source geospatial data, then maps them to their common subspaces to obtain their cross correlations respectively. These semantic features and their cross-correlations are integrated together to classify urban functions. An experiment in Shenzhen, China was implemented to evaluate the performance of the presented model at a fine scale. The results show that the proposed CC-FLU model achieved a better performance than previous methods, yielding OA and Kappa values of 0.851 and 0.812, respectively. The results of the presented approach outperform those of methods using one single source geospatial data. The results demonstrate that the skilled information of each type of geospatial data is fully melted into the data fusion model, and simultaneously achieves the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data. Moreover, this study resolves the possible disadvantages of models using one single source data and fusion methods by sequentially concatenating multi-source features. The results will benefit urban planners and urban policy-makers.

TI  - Rangeland And Pasture Monitoring: An Approach To Interpretation Of High-Resolution Imagery Focused On Observer Calibration For Repeatability
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2012
AB  - Collection of standardized assessment and monitoring data is critically important for supporting policy and management at local to continental scales. Remote sensing techniques, including image interpretation, have shown promise for collecting plant community composition and ground cover data efficiently. More work needs to be done, however, evaluating whether these techniques are sufficiently feasible, cost-effective, and repeatable to be applied in large programs. The goal of this study was to design and test an image-interpretation approach for collecting plant community composition and ground cover data appropriate for local and continental-scale assessment and monitoring of grassland, shrubland, savanna, and pasture ecosystems. We developed a geographic information system image-interpretation tool that uses points classified by experts to calibrate observers, including point-by-point training and quantitative quality control limits. To test this approach, field data and high-resolution imagery (similar to 3 cm ground sampling distance) were collected concurrently at 54 plots located around the USA. Seven observers with little prior experience used the system to classify 300 points in each plot into ten cover types (grass, shrub, soil, etc.). Good agreement among observers was achieved, with little detectable bias and low variability among observers (coefficient of variation in most plots < 0.5). There was a predictable relationship between field and image-interpreter data (R (2) > 0.9), suggesting regression-based adjustments can be used to relate image and field data. This approach could extend the utility of expensive-to-collect field data by allowing it to serve as a validation data source for data collected via image interpretation.

PY  - 2006
AB  - The WMO Space Programme was established by the Fourteenth WMO Congress in May 2003 and inaugurated on 1 January 2004 as a new major cross-cutting Programme. The paper describes the current status of the expanded space-based component of the World Weather Watch's Global Observing System (GOS) including access by WMO Members to new data streams from R&D space missions. In particular, the paper focuses on the development of the Integrated Global Data Dissemination Service (IGDDS), a component of the WMO Information System (WIS) that will improve satellite data access by WMO Members. IGDDS will also be a core component of data dissemination for the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). GEOSS data dissemination for all nine societal benefit areas will be provided through a new system called GEONET-Cast. IGDDS defines the satellite data and products circulation scheme that is expected to meet the needs of WMO Programmes, within the WMO Information System (WIS), in accordance with the WMO Space Programme Implementation Plan 2004-2007 agreed by the WMO Executive Council at it fifty-sixth session (EC LVI, 2004). IGDDS was endorsed by WMO EC-LVI in order to ensure that Advanced Dissemination Methods (ADM) initiatives resulted in a dissemination system that was optimized with respect to the needs of the global user community. It was appropriate to consider the possible shape of IGDDS which would build on the ADM concept. The concept of IGDDS is also seen as central to the vision of an integrated space-based component of the Global Observing System as it will facilitate the access to the complete range of data and products from this component of the WMO's GOS. Furthermore, the necessary articulation between IGDDS and the WMO Information System was addressed at WMO Executive Council's fifty-seventh session (EC LVII, 2005) that emphasized the important role of satellite-based data-distribution systems and noted their extensive implementation and the significant technological upgrades (e.g., DVB-S) that had been achieved.

TI  - Estimation Of Vegetation Coverage Based On Seasonal Variabilities In Modis-Based Vegetation Indices
JO  - World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2018: Watershed Management, Irrigation and Drainage, and Water Resources Planning and Management - Selected Papers from the World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2018
PY  - 2018
AB  - Determination of the vegetation coverage (VC) plays an important role in different aspects of watershed management. Remote sensing products can provide estimates of VC; however, the uncertainty of the data acquisition and processing has always challenged the usability of spaceborne imagery data. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products used to model VC of three basins: Lower Fox (LF) in Wisconsin, Lower East Fork White (LEFW) in Indiana, and Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) in California. MODIS MOD13Q1 product is used to obtain VC based on enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, the commonly used threshold value of 0.4, used to differentiate vegetated from non-vegetated areas, does not necessarily yield to accurate estimates when compared to the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). A statistical criterion - determined based on probability distributions of VC - used to filter pixels with low vegetation index (VI) values during the time of peak-vegetation as non-vegetated. The same approach implemented to determine vegetated areas during the low-vegetation season. These pixels were left out of analysis - regardless of the VI value - and their VC condition was determined based on the group of filtered data they belong to. Then, VC was calculated for the remaining pixels and results were integrated with those of the filtered areas. Application of the suggested technique improved VC estimations. The errors of VC estimations based on NLCD-VI comparison were reduced by 0%, 3%, and 33% for EVI and 17%, 6%, and 2% for NDVI in LF, LEFW, and LSJR basins, respectively. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Research In Crop Yield Estimation Models On Different Scales Based On Remote Sensing And Crop Growth Model
JO  - Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi/Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - Food security is a guarantee for social harmony, political stability and sustainable development of the economy. However, current research on crop yield estimation is mostly regional and empirical, relying too much on ground-measured data. Scalable Crop Yield Mapping (SCYM) is a satellite data based framework for estimating crop yield.It can be quickly applied to the estimated yield of different spatial scales and different types of crops without relying on measured data. This framework provides an important theoretical basis for multi-scale crop yield estimation research. We took the winter wheat of Anhui Province from 2012 to 2018 as the study object. Firstly, the sensitive parameters determined by the predecessors and their fluctuation ranges in the study area are summarized. Combined with a large amount of site data, the parameters optimization of the WOFOST model was completed. Secondly, random forest models were established based on the simulated yield, simulated leaf area index (LAI) at different periods, and selected meteorological indicators. Finally, the MODIS-LAI under the best observation date combination replaced the simulated LAI for the corresponding time periods to estimate the winter wheat yield in Anhui Province. The main outcomes in this study are as follows: (1) The overall correlation between the estimated outputs and the measured data of the stations is 0.758 (R2 is 0.575), and the RMSE is 790.92 kg•ha-1. The sites with higher production accuracy are mainly distributed in the Huaibei Plain (<1%), while the areas with high errors are concentrated in the hilly areas of southern Anhui (>40%). (2) The winter wheat yield in Anhui Province from 2012 to 2018 was estimated by SCYM. According to the spatial distribution of the 7-year average yield estimation, the yield is gradually decreasing from north to south. The high-value areas are located in the Huaibei Plain in northern Anhui, and the low-value areas are distributed in central Anhui and southern Anhui. (3) The average measured yield from 2012 to 2018 is 6 058.00 kg•ha-1, while the average yield of the SCYM is 5 984.95 kg•ha-1. The correlation between them in the interannual time series is 0.822, and the RMSE is 189.96 kg•ha-1. In seven years, the relative error each year does not exceed 6%. This study shows that the SCYM framework is feasible for estimating winter wheat yield in Anhui Province and has a good effect on yield forecast. This method can improve the regionality and empiricism of the previous crop yield estimation models to a certain extent. Meanwhile, it also solves the shortcomings of computationally intensive methods, which are costly and difficult to popularize. Thus, SCYM has great potential in applying of regional scales, and it will provide an extremely important theoretical basis and practical value for agricultural production in the future. © 2021, Peking University Press.

TI  - Landslide Dynamic Susceptibility Mapping Base On Machine Learning And The Ps-Insar Coupling Model
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Complex and fragile geological conditions combined with periodic fluctuations in reservoir water levels have led to frequent landslide disasters in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. With the development of remote sensing technology, many scholars have applied it to landslide susceptibility assessment to improve model accuracy; however, how to couple these two to obtain the optimal susceptibility assessment model remains to be studied. Based on Sentinel-1 data, relevant data, and existing research results, the information value method (IV), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models were selected to analyze landslide susceptibility in the urban area of Wanzhou. Models with superior performance will be coupled with PS-InSAR deformation data using two methods: joint training and weighted overlay. The accuracy of different models was assessed and compared with the aim of determining the optimal coupling model and the role of InSAR in the model. The results indicate that the accuracy of different landslide susceptibility prediction models is ranked as RF > SVM > CNN > IV. Among the coupled dynamic models, the performance ranking was as follows: InSAR jointly trained RF (IJRF) > InSAR weighted overlay RF (IWRF) > InSAR jointly trained SVM (IJSVM) > InSAR weighted overlay SVM (IWSVM). Notably, the IJRF model, which combines InSAR deformation data through joint training, exhibited the highest accuracy, with an AUC value of 0.995. In the factor importance analysis within the IJRF model, InSAR deformation data ranked third after hydrological distance (0.210) and elevation (0.163), with a value of 0.154. A comparison between landslide dynamic susceptibility mapping (LDSM) and landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) revealed that the inclusion of InSAR deformation data effectively reduced false positives around the landslide areas. The results suggest that joint training is the most suitable coupling method, allowing for the optimal expression of InSAR deformation data and enhancing the predictive accuracy of the model. This study serves as a reference for future research and provides a foundation for landslide risk management. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Uncertainties Associated With The Use Of Optical Remote Sensing Technique To Estimate Surface Emissions In Landfill Applications
JO  - Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association
PY  - 2010
AB  - Landfills represent a source of distributed emissions source over an irregular and heterogeneous surface. In the method termed "Other Test Method-10" (OTM-10), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a method to quantify emissions from such sources by the use of vertical radial plume mapping (VRPM) techniques combined with measurement of wind speed to determine the average emission flux per unit area per time from nonpoint sources. In such application, the VRPM is used as a tool to estimate the mass of the gas of interest crossing a vertical plane. This estimation is done by fitting the field-measured concentration spatial data to a Gaussian or some other distribution to define a plume crossing the vertical plane. When this technique is applied to landfill surfaces, the VRPM plane may be within the emitting source area itself. The objective of this study was to investigate uncertainties associated with using OTM-10 for landfills. The spatial variability of emission in the emitting domain can lead to uncertainties of -34 to 190% in the measured flux value when idealistic scenarios were simulated. The level of uncertainty might be higher when the number and locations of emitting sources are not known (typical field conditions). The level of uncertainty can be reduced by improving the layout of the VRPM plane in the field in accordance with an initial survey of the emission patterns. The change in wind direction during an OTM-10 testing setup can introduce an uncertainty of 20% of the measured flux value. This study also provides estimates of the area contributing to flux (ACF) to be used in conjunction with OTM-10 procedures. The estimate of ACF is a function of the atmospheric stability class and has an uncertainty of 10-30%. Copyright 2010 Air & Waste Management Association.

TI  - Using Crowdsourced Imagery To Detect Cultural Ecosystem Services: A Case Study In South Wales, Uk
JO  - Ecology and Society
PY  - 2016
AB  - Within ecological research and environmental management, there is currently a focus on demonstrating the links between human well-being and wildlife conservation. Within this framework, there is a clear interest in better understanding how and why people value certain places over others. We introduce a new method that measures cultural preferences by exploring the potential of multiple online georeferenced digital photograph collections. Using ecological and social considerations, our study contributes to the detection of places that provide cultural ecosystem services. The degree of appreciation of a specific place is derived from the number of people taking and sharing pictures of it. The sequence of decisions and actions taken to share a digital picture of a given place includes the effort to travel to the place, the willingness to take a picture, the decision to geolocate the picture, and the action of sharing it through the Internet. Hence, the social activity of sharing pictures leaves digital proxies of spatial preferences, with people sharing specific photos considering the depicted place not only “worth visiting” but also “worth sharing visually.” Using South Wales as a case study, we demonstrate how the proposed methodology can help identify key geographic features of high cultural value. These results highlight how the inclusion of geographical user-generated content, also known as volunteered geographic information, can be very effective in addressing some of the current priorities in conservation. Indeed, the detection of the most appreciated nonurban areas could be used for better prioritization, planning, and management. © 2016 by the author(s).

TI  - Spatial Accessibility Analysis And Optimization Simulation Of Urban Riverfront Space Based On Space Syntax And Pois: A Case Study Of Songxi County, China
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Optimizing accessibility to urban riverfront spaces plays a pivotal role in enhancing the spatial vitality of urban regions and promoting the high-quality development of such areas. The degree of riverfront space accessibility can be assessed through the connectivity of urban roads, which directly impacts the spatial vitality of these areas. This study constructs an axial and segmental model of the urban road network based on the space syntax theory. Through the Geographic Information System (GIS), kernel density analysis is performed on the Points of Interest (POI) and Depthmap data of Songxi County to comprehensively examine the reasonableness of the segmental network model and its visual representation. Quantitative evaluation of the accessibility of riverfront space in Songxi County from three dimensions, namely topological accessibility, geometrical accessibility, and perceptual accessibility, is conducted. The results show that (1) the accessibility of high-value area of riverfront space in Songxi County's central city exhibits an unbalanced distribution, with a concentration in the central area. (2) A certain degree of mismatch exists between the distribution area of high accessibility in urban space and that of the waterfront space, highlighting the need for improved traffic planning in the riverfront area. (3) Weak spatial connections are shown between the north and south riverfronts, with areas of high accessibility values showing a clear break at the riverbank. Based on the results of the quantitative analysis, the proposed approach involves optimizing the spatial layout of urban roads and riverfront spaces through several key strategies. These strategies encompass enhancing the layout of the transport network, strengthening the coupling links between the two sides of the river, enriching the functions of the riverfront space, and conducting simulations to test the feasibility of these measures. The simulation results revealed a noteworthy enhancement in the integration and choice value of urban roads and riverfront spaces. Therefore, the optimization strategy employed in this study significantly improved the connectivity and accessibility of the overall transport network, leading to a more balanced distribution of high accessibility value areas within the city and riverfront space. This paper centers on the interaction between individuals and the river, to enhance the restoration of riverfront vitality. As a result, it is anticipated to provide valuable insights into the sustainable development of riverfront spaces.

TI  - Science Opportunities With Solar Sailing Smallsats
JO  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Recently, we witnessed how the synergy of small satellite technology and solar sailing propulsion enables new missions. Together, small satellites with lightweight instruments and solar sails offer affordable access to deep regions of the solar system, also making it possible to realize hard-to-reach trajectories that are not constrained to the ecliptic plane. Combining these two technologies can drastically reduce travel times within the solar system, while delivering robust science. With solar sailing propulsion capable of reaching the velocities of similar to 5-10 AU/yr, missions using a rideshare launch may reach the Jovian system in two years, Saturn in three. The same technologies could allow reaching solar polar orbits in less than two years. Fast, cost-effective, and maneuverable sailcraft that may travel outside the ecliptic plane open new opportunities for affordable solar system exploration, with great promise for heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics. Such missions could be modularized to reach different destinations with different sets of instruments. Benefiting from this progress, we present the "Sundiver" concept, offering novel possibilities for the science community. We discuss some of the key technologies, the current design of the Sundiver sailcraft vehicle and innovative instruments, along with unique science opportunities that these technologies enable, especially as this exploration paradigm evolves. We formulate policy recommendations to allow national space agencies, industry, and other stakeholders to establish a strong scientific, programmatic, and commercial focus, enrich and deepen the space enterprise and broaden its advocacy base by including the Sundiver paradigm as a part of broader space exploration efforts.

TI  - Information And Communication Technologies (Ict) In Building Knowledge Processes In Vulnerable Ecosystems: A Case For Sustainability
JO  - Green Finance and Sustainability: Environmentally-Aware Business Models and Technologies
PY  - 2011
AB  - Changes in precipitation, temperature, glacial melt patterns and sea level rise are being seen as increasingly affecting the world's ecosystems and natural resource base. Recognizing the value of information available from the broader community and also the changing framework of traditional knowledge and local perceptions, an integrated approach to building knowledge based scientific information is proposed through the use of effective ICT based tools and strategic information databases and networks. Technological advances have a major role to play in developing a sound, efficient, and sustainable pathway for a region or country in the face of increased economic growth. The increasing conflicts arising between economic growth and natural processes or green ecosystems can only be bridged if sustainable and innovative technologies are adopted for sharing information and diffusion across different sectors of society. The present chapter explores the use of some of the current state of the art technologies like ICTs including tools like Remote Sensing and GIS as a means for providing sound and efficient decision making across various sectors. © 2011, IGI Global.

TI  - A Comparative Evaluation Of Arid Inflow-Dependent Vegetation Maps Derived From Landsat Top-Of-Atmosphere And Surface Reflectances
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2018
AB  - In remote sensing, it is commonly accepted that land remote-sensing satellite (LANDSAT) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance is less accurate than atmospheric correction (AC) reflectance, as the former is not calibrated for possible modifications in the electromagnetic radiation signals due to atmospheric scattering and absorption. This article investigates whether LANDSAT data calibrated for TOA reflectance are an appropriate information source for delineating inflow-dependent vegetation (IDV) in regions with an arid and desert climate, such as the Pilbara region in Western Australia. Knowledge of where IDVs are in the landscape underpins planning their protection and define the baseline for their monitoring when water resource management options are considered. The appropriateness of TOA calibration for the delineation of IDV in the Pilbara was assessed through its comparison with IDV maps derived from AC reflectance. Both radiometric calibration methods (TOA and AC) were applied to a multi-date LANDSAT 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) dataset of 10 images acquired in 2009 and 2010. Two methods based on the application of remote-sensing techniques to identify the extent of temporally invariant vegetation were applied for IDV delineation in the study area. The first method, groundwater-dependent ecosystems mapping (GEM), employs a two-date normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset for identifying 'no-change' clusters of land cover and detecting those related to IDV. The second method applies principal component analysis (PCA) to a multi-date NDVI dataset. The first principal component (PC1) typically contains features that remain unchanged over time. This includes vegetation with continuous or frequent access to surface and/or groundwater, such as IDV. To delineate the extent of IDV, a thresholding technique was further employed. Spatial similarity between IDV maps produced from TOA and AC reflectance was quantitatively evaluated by the Kappa coefficient. The results showed that TOA and AC IDV maps are in 'almost perfect' agreement with the Kappa values above 0.83. This suggests that TOA reflectance is equally appropriate to AC reflectance for mapping in arid and desert climate such as in Pilbara. When the GEM- and PCA-based methods are applied in other study areas with arid or desert climate, the accuracy of the delineated IDV extent may vary. Therefore, the results need to be validated using ground-truth information about known IDV occurrences in the area of interest.

TI  - An Ecosystem Service Value Assessment Of Land-Use Change In South Korea Using Remote Sensing Data And Geographic Information System
PY  - 2011
AB  - In Korea, rapid industrialization and economic growth have led to serious problems including reduced open space, environmental degradation, traffic congestion, and urban sprawl. These problems have been exacerbated by the absence of effective conservation and governance, and have resulted in various social conflicts. This study analyzed ecosystem service value over the past 20 years using previously reported coefficients. In addition, using logistic regression, we projected the land-cover distribution in 2020 according to the Environmental Conservation Value Assessment Map and analyzed ecosystem service value based on land use changes. Between 1985 and 2005, built-up areas had increased threefold. In the same time period, forest, grassland, and wetland areas decreased. Because of these trends, ecosystem service value decreased from 7,300 million USD to 6,525 million USD. By analyzing land-cover distribution with 2020 land-cover maps, we determined that farmland, grassland, and bare land areas had declined by approximately 24.3\%. The 2020 land-cover map with considering ECVAM showed a decrease of 89 million USD in ecosystem service value, while the map without considering ECVAM showed a decrease of 165 million USD. The results of this analysis indicate that environmentally sustainable systems and urban development must be applied to achieve sustainable development and environmental protection.

TI  - No2 Anomalies - Economy Attribution And Rapid Climate Response
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Close to two decades of NASA Earth Observing System satellite data and algorithms refinements present unique opportunity to revisit the attributions of variability of tropospheric pollutants to economic activity, as well as pollutants contribution to the anthropogenic radiative forcing. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the top pollutants produced by industrial and power plants and traffic. That long data record now covers events of economic variability like the recession of 2008/2009, as well as the effects of COVID-19 closures of 2019/2020. In particular, the COVID-19 lockdowns in the winter of 2019/2020 and the spring of 2020 resulted in contracting economies around the world. While numerous imageries of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2) appeared to be popular, few studied gave numerical assessment of how much of the anomalies is attributable to the economic slowdown. Furthermore, few studies touched on the possible climate offsets under the reduced emissions. Using principal component (PC) analysis of 16 years of NO2 monthly series data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the Aura satellite, we show that it is the third PC (PC3) from the deseasonalized hierarchy of principal modes that is best coupled with the economic indicators. This coupling is positive, i.e. PC3 and economic indicators manifest positive covariance. However, the economic variability can explain only 40% of the information in PC3. Furthermore, this mode by itself explains only 3% of the total deseasonalized NO2 variability. We therefore conclude that, while having an unambiguous impact, the economy can be awarded at best third order of importance in the NO2 departures from the seasonal averages. Once we identified PC3 as the NO2 mode that is coupled with the economic variability, we use this mode as an indicator and look for rapid climate adjustments to that part of the NO2 variability that we are confident is coupled with the economic variability. We focus on observational data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board the NASA Aqua satellite, decompose the series of surface skin temperature and clear-sky outgoing longwave radiances (OLR) into principal components, and identify potential impacts of the NO2 PC3 on these climate variables. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Remote Sensing Technology Online Education In Africa: A Multicultural Experience
PY  - 2014
AB  - The discussion of environmental issues and sustainable development of society has been growing worldwide in the past decades. The application of remote sensing - the technology of observing, collecting and analyzing the data of planet Earth and its immediate environment from air and space altitudes - has enriched human knowledge of our globe and enhanced our survival therein. Remote sensing continues to be gainfully employed as major tool of international cooperation. Most Remote Sensing education programs worldwide have pointed toward interdisciplinarity, providing a balanced experience for students spanning the domains of engineering, theory, data analysis, applications, and policy. Established in 1984, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) coordinates civil space-borne observations of the Earth, where the participating agencies strive to enhance international coordination and data exchange and to optimize societal benefit. Within CEOS, the Working Group on Capacity Building and Data Democracy (WGCapD) aims at building upon the CEOS Data Democracy Initiative in an effort to increase the capacity of institutions in less developed countries for effective use of Earth Observation data for the benefit of society and to achieve sustainable development. CEOS Agencies have joined efforts to put forward an e-learning course named International e-learning course on Introduction to Remote Sensing Technology. The objective of this paper is to present the results and lessons learned from this first initiative for Anglophone countries in Africa. With a multicultural perception, the article discusses the online education experience and gives some perspectives on further developments to be implemented in a possible second version of the course. The course was free of charge and targeted at University Lecturers who can enhance the multiplier effect and help preparing the practitioners to use remote sensing in Earth sciences. The students came from various backgrounds and application interest areas. The main goal was to create collaborative learning opportunities, providing the learners with an appreciation of current remote sensing issues, the geologic and human processes that impact remotely-gathered data, and how those processes can be measured using remote sensing. The 19 voluntary instructors came from seven space agencies in different countries including Argentina, Brazil, Austria, France, India, South Africa and the US. Over 70 people signed up, 30 participated (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania) throughout the 16 weeks that the course ran, and 16 undertook all assessments and received the certificate. Course materials included well-organized tutorials, selected datasets and internet links. Two live classroom sessions per week were held, recorded and made available afterwards for downloading. Students were exposed to a variety of resources, software tools and datasets, all of open and free access. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to students and instructors seeking at information that would enable assessment of the contribution of the course as well as suggestions for improvement. Overall, this has been a successful multicultural experience for accessing education in Remote Sensing in developing countries. Despite some limitations, the delivery methodology has proved to be efficient and the outcomes of this online course have been encouraging to pursue other courses in the future.

TI  - The Neighborhood Effect Of Exposure To Blue Space On Elderly Individuals' Mental Health: A Case Study In Guangzhou, China
JO  - HEALTH \& PLACE
PY  - 2020
AB  - Within the urban setting, blue space refers to all visible surface waters, including lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. Exposure to the natural environment, especially blue space, has been consistently linked to better mental health. While previous studies have disentangled the positive relationship between neighborhood blue space and mental health, scant attention has been paid to pathways through which neighborhood blue space affects mental health among Chinese urban elderly individuals. Based on questionnaire data collected from Guangzhou in 2018, remote sensing images, street-scapes, and other such sources, we extracted various blue space indicators. We employed multilevel linear regression modeling, mediating effect modeling to examine bio-psychosocial pathways and mechanisms linking exposure to blue space and elderly individuals' mental health. Propensity score matching method was employed to deal with selection bias. According to this empirical analysis, firstly, neighborhood exposure to blue space was significantly associated with elderly individuals' mental health. Secondly, environmental harm reduction, stress reduction, and social contact facilitation played a separate role in mediating the effect of blue space exposure on elderly individuals' mental health. These findings confirm the mediation pathways in the context of Chinese cities. Our research enriches the empirical research on blue space and public health from the perspective of health geography, and suggests the need for "healthy neighborhood" and "health aging" planning in Chinese settings.

TI  - Evaluation Of An Automated Safety Surveillance System Using Risk Adjusted Sequential Probability Ratio Testing
JO  - BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Automated adverse outcome surveillance tools and methods have potential utility in quality improvement and medical product surveillance activities. Their use for assessing hospital performance on the basis of patient outcomes has received little attention. We compared risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio testing (RA-SPRT) implemented in an automated tool to Massachusetts public reports of 30-day mortality after isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Methods. A total of 23,020 isolated adult coronary artery bypass surgery admissions performed in Massachusetts hospitals between January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2007 were retrospectively re-evaluated. The RA-SPRT method was implemented within an automated surveillance tool to identify hospital outliers in yearly increments. We used an overall type I error rate of 0.05, an overall type II error rate of 0.10, and a threshold that signaled if the odds of dying 30-days after surgery was at least twice than expected. Annual hospital outlier status, based on the state-reported classification, was considered the gold standard. An event was defined as at least one occurrence of a higher-than-expected hospital mortality rate during a given year. Results: We examined a total of 83 hospital-year observations. The RA-SPRT method alerted 6 events among three hospitals for 30-day mortality compared with 5 events among two hospitals using the state public reports, yielding a sensitivity of 100% (5/5) and specificity of 98.8% (79/80). Conclusions: The automated RA-SPRT method performed well, detecting all of the true institutional outliers with a small false positive alerting rate. Such a system could provide confidential automated notification to local institutions in advance of public reporting providing opportunities for earlier quality improvement interventions. © 2011 Matheny et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Using Satellite Image Fusion To Evaluate The Impact Of Land Use Changes On Ecosystem Services And Their Economic Values
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accelerated land use change is a current challenge for environmental management worldwide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004-2019) from fused imageries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34\%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local authorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales.

TI  - Putting Sea Cucumbers On The Map: Projected Holothurian Bioturbation Rates On A Coral Reef Scale
JO  - CORAL REEFS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Bioturbation of reef sediments aerates the upper sediment layers and releases organic material to benthic communities. Despite being the larger and more conspicuous bioturbators on coral reefs, the value of holothurians (sea cucumbers) to reef ecosystems is less often attributed to their ecosystem services than their value for fisheries. This may be because they are considered to have an insignificant effect on reef health relative to other animals. Here, we ground-truthed remote sensing data obtained from drone and satellite imagery to estimate the bioturbation rates of holothurians across the 19 km(2) Heron Island Reef in Queensland, Australia. Ex situ bioturbation rates of the most abundant holothurian, Holothuria atra, were assessed during 24-h feeding experiments. Using density measurements of holothurians across reef flat zones in a 27,000 m(2) map produced from drone imagery, we extrapolated bioturbation across the reef using satellite remote sensing data. Individual H. atra were estimated to produce approximately 14 kg of bioturbated sediment per year. On a reef scale (excluding the reef lagoon) and accounting for varying densities of holothurians across different reef zones, total bioturbation from holothurians at Heron Reef was estimated at over 64,000 metric tonnes per year, slightly more than the mass of five Eiffel Towers. These results highlight the scale of structural and biochemical impacts that holothurians have on reef flats and their importance to ecosystem functioning and services. Management of these animals on reefs is imperative as overharvesting would likely cause substantial negative effects on sedimentary ecosystems and their biogeochemistry in corals reefs.

TI  - Mapping Algal Blooms In Aquatic Ecosystems Using Long-Term Landsat Data: A Case Study Of Yuqiao Reservoir From 1984–2022
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Water eutrophication poses a dual threat to ecological and human well-being. Gaining insight into the intricate dynamics of phytoplankton bloom phenology holds paramount importance in comprehending the complexities of aquatic ecosystems. Remote sensing technologies have gained attention for mapping algal blooms (ABs) effectively, but distinguishing them from aquatic vegetation (AV) remains challenging due to their similar spectral characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a meticulous three-step methodology for AB mapping employing long-term Landsat imagery. Initially, a multi-index decision tree model (DTM) is deployed to identify the vegetation signal (VS) encompassing both AV and ABs. Subsequently, the annual maximum growth range of AV is precisely delineated using vegetation presence frequency (VPF) in conjunction with normal and low water level imagery. Lastly, ABs are accurately extracted by inversely intersecting VS and AV. The performance of our approach is thoroughly validated using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) based on a Gaofen-2 Panchromatic Multi-spectral (GF-2 PMS) image, demonstrating strong consistency with notable values of 0.822 longitudinally, 0.771 latitudinally, and 0.797 overall. The method is applied to Landsat images from 1984 to 2022 to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal variations of ABs in Yuqiao Reservoir—a significant national water body spanning a vast area of 135 km2 in China. Our findings reveal a pervasive and uneven dispersion of ABs, predominantly concentrated in the northern sector. Notably, the intensity of ABs experienced an initial surge from 1984 to 2008, followed by a subsequent decline from 2014 to 2022. Importantly, anthropogenic activities, such as fish cage culture, alongside pollution stemming from nearby industrial and agricultural sources, exert a profound influence on the dynamics of water eutrophication. Fortunately, governmental initiatives focused on water purification exhibit commendable efficacy in mitigating the ecological burden on reservoirs and upholding water quality. The methodological framework presented in this study boasts remarkable precision in AB extraction and exhibits considerable potential in addressing the needs of aquatic ecosystems. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Legality Of The Deployment Of Conventional Weapons In Earth Orbit: Balancing Space Law And The Law Of Armed Conflict
JO  - European Journal of International Law
PY  - 2007
AB  - The Bush Administration of the United States recently released a revised National Space Policy. Although the revised National Space Policy can be interpreted as a step towards the weaponization of space, it does not necessarily weaponize space. It nonetheless brings to the forefront important legal issues concerning the basing of conventional weapons in space. The present international law matrix on the issue of space-based weapons is to be found in international space law, principally in the Outer Space Treaty, where certain prohibitions apply to nuclear weapons and to weapons of mass destruction. Space must also be used for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development. Space objects must be registered in accordance with the Registration Convention. The UN collective security system and the customary right of self-defence govern the use of force or jus ad bellum. The means and methods through which self-defence is exercised are in turn governed by international humanitarian law. Should space be weaponized the basing of these weapons and their use will be subject not only to international space law but also to the UN Charter and to international humanitarian law. The interface between these legal regimes consequently gains in importance, possibly forcing a reinterpretation of certain space treaties along with a correction in state practice. © The European Journal of International Law Vol. 18 no. 5 EJIL 2008; all rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation Of A Remote Monitoring System For Diabetes Control
JO  - Clinical Therapeutics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose The use of technology to implement cost-effective health care management on a large scale may be an alternative for diabetes management but needs to be evaluated in controlled trials. This study assessed the utility and cost-effectiveness of an automated Diabetes Remote Monitoring and Management System (DRMS) in glycemic control versus usual care. Methods In this randomized, controlled study, patients with uncontrolled diabetes on insulin were randomized to use of the DRMS or usual care. Participants in both groups were followed up for 6 months and had 3 clinic visits at 0, 3, and 6 months. The DRMS used text messages or phone calls to remind patients to test their blood glucose and to report results via an automated system, with no human interaction unless a patient had severely high or low blood glucose. The DRMS made adjustments to insulin dose(s) based on validated algorithms. Participants reported medication adherence through the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8, and diabetes-specific quality of life through the diabetes Daily Quality of Life questionnaire. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on the estimated overall costs of DRMS and usual care. Findings A total of 98 patients were enrolled (59 [60%] female; mean age, 59 years); 87 participants (89%) completed follow-up. HbA1c was similar between the DRMS and control groups at 3 months (7.60% vs 8.10%) and at 6 months (8.10% vs 7.90%). Changes from baseline to 6 months were not statistically significant for self-reported medication adherence and diabetes-specific quality of life, with the exception of the Daily Quality of Life-Social/Vocational Concerns subscale score (P = 0.04). Implications An automated system like the DRMS may improve glycemic control to the same degree as usual clinic care and may significantly improve the social/vocational aspects of quality of life. Cost-effectiveness analysis found DRMS to be cost-effective when compared to usual care and suggests DRMS has a good scale of economy for program scale up. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the benefits seen with the automated system over longer periods. © 2015 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation Of Residential Impervious Surface Using Gis Technique
JO  - Planning Malaysia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urban impervious surface in the form of rooftops, street pavement, parking lots, etc. is an important contributor to water pollution, urban heat island, flash floods and other environmental degradations. While studies on the extent of impervious surface are common in advanced countries, few have been carried out in developing countries. This paper discusses a study on the nature of impervious surface coverage in a southern city in Malaysia. The study focuses on impervious surface in several residential areas, looking at the relationship between impervious surface and housing density as well as the source of the surface. Remote sensing images combined with some GIS techniques were employed for this purpose. The percentage of impervious surface measured ranged from 40-95%, well above the values indicated from similar studies overseas. While density was a factor in the amount of impervious surface, it was not the only factor. Other factors such as policies on impervious surface control were also important as illustrated by comparison of the results of this study to similar studies reported in the USA. Based on these findings, the paper offers several steps towards reduction of impervious surface in residential areas. © 2013 by MIP.

TI  - The Impact Of Advanced Treatment Technologies On The Energy Use In Satellite Water Reuse Plants
JO  - Water (Switzerland)
PY  - 2020
AB  - With an ever-increasing world population and the resulting increase in industrialization and agricultural practices, depletion of one of the world's most important natural resources, water, is inevitable. Water reclamation and reuse is the key to protecting this natural resource. Water reclamation using smaller decentralized wastewater treatment plants, known as satellite water reuse plants (WRP), has become popular in the last decade. Reuse plants have stricter standards for effluent quality and require a smaller land footprint (i.e., real estate area). They also require additional treatment processes and advanced treatment technologies. This greatly increases the energy consumption of an already energy intensive process, accentuating even more the nexus between energy use and wastewater processing. With growing concerns over the use of nonrenewable energy sources and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, WRPs are in need of energy evaluations. This paper contrasts the energy consumption of both conventional and advanced treatment processes in satellite WRPs. Results of this research provide a means for engineers and wastewater utilities to evaluate unit processes based on energy consumption as well as a foundation for making decisions regarding the sustainability of using advanced treatment technologies at reuse facilities. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Land Use Transition And Effects On Ecosystem Services In Water-Rich Cities Under Rapid Urbanization: A Case Study Of Wuhan City, China
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecosystems can provide ecosystems service for human society. Exploring the impact of land use transition of water-rich cities on ecosystem service can obtain a large amount of scientific data, and its findings have certain significance for building a sustainable city land use transition pattern. This study takes Wuhan, a water-rich city, as the study area, combines remote sensing image data and macro-economic data in the region from 2000 to 2020, and uses spatial analysis methods, the equivalent factor calculation method, and hot spot analysis to portray the spatial-temporal patterns of land use transition in Wuhan and its effect on ecosystem service values. The results show that: (1) farmland, water, and built-up land are the main land use types in Wuhan, and the continuous expansion of built-up land area is an important factor in the decrease of farmland, wetland, and grassland areas; (2) The change in ecosystem service values in Wuhan is influenced by the fluctuation of water area, and the overall ecosystem service values in Wuhan increased from CNY (Chinese Yuan) 56.498 billion (USD 8.47 billion) in 2000 to CNY 56.749 billion (USD 8.508 billion) in 2020, with an increase of CNY 251.3 million (USD 37.676 million) between 2000 and 2020. Among them, the ecosystem services values of water increased by CNY 1.223 billion (USD 183.358 million), and the ecosystem service values of its assumed hydrological regulation function also increased by CNY 995.7 million (USD149.28 million) during this period; (3) In the period 2000-2020, the hotspot areas for the value supply of ecosystem services were mainly distributed in Jiangxia, Hongshan, Hannan, Xinzhou, Huangpi and some areas of Caidian, which are covered with a large proportion of water, while the cold spots are mainly distributed in Jiang'an, Jianghan, Qiaokou, and Qingshan districts, which have more built-up land, and Huangpi, Caidian, Jiangxia, and Xinzhou districts, which have more farmland. Sustainable land planning solutions should take into account typical regional land use transition patterns and incorporate them into smart land planning practices. This study can provide key information for smart land planning.

TI  - Measuring The Involvement Of Companies In Prevention: Setting A Conceptual Framework
JO  - Archives des Maladies Professionnelles et de l'Environnement
PY  - 2021
AB  - The European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) has shown that preventive action in the workplace is often perceived as a regulatory constraint. The economic and health benefits of prevention are poorly documented and leave the way open for a dominant negative perception of efforts to be devoted to health and well-being at work as leading to unproductive expenditure. The aim of this article is to characterize as best as possible the degree of involvement of enterprises in prevention. The methodology used is based both on a literature review of available tools and a qualitative study conducted in 2018 in France. This study was carried out through semi-directive telephone interviews with 5 occupational physicians, 5 human resources managers and 5 staff representatives. The results of the interviews made it possible to identify the main dimensions to be documented in a quantitative questionnaire which, in the long term, would serve as a basis for constructing a prevention involvement score. These dimensions cover compliance with legal obligations, the quality of social dialogue, the place of occupational health in the management of the company, and the existence of resources dedicated to prevention. © 2021 The Authors; L'Enquête européenne des entreprises sur les risques nouveaux et émergents (ESENER) a montré que les actions préventives sur le lieu de travail sont souvent perçues comme une contrainte réglementaire. Les avantages économiques et sanitaires de la prévention sont mal documentés et laissent la voie libre à une perception négative dominante des efforts à consacrer à la santé et au bien-être au travail comme entraînant des dépenses improductives. L'objectif de cet article est de caractériser au mieux le degré d'implication des entreprises en prévention. La méthodologie utilisée repose à la fois sur une revue de littérature des outils disponibles et d'une étude qualitative conduite en 2018 en France. Cette étude a été réalisée grâce à des entretiens téléphoniques semi-directifs auprès de 5 médecins du travail, 5 DRH et 5 représentants du personnel. Les résultats des entretiens ont permis d'identifier les principales dimensions à documenter dans un questionnaire quantitatif qui, à terme servirait de base de construction d'un score d'implication en prévention. Ces dimensions recouvrent le respect des obligations légales, la qualité du dialogue social, la place de la santé au travail dans la gestion de l'entreprise, et l'existence de moyens dédiés à la prévention. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Catchment-Scale Flood Modelling In Data-Sparse Regions Using Open-Access Geospatial Technology
JO  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Consistent data are seldom available for whole-catchment flood modelling in many developing regions, hence this study aimed to explore an integrated approach for flood modelling and mapping by combining available segmented hydrographic, topographic, floodplain roughness, calibration, and validation datasets using a two-dimensional Caesar-Lisflood hydrodynamic model to quantify and recreate the extent and impact of the historic 2012 flood in Nigeria. Available segments of remotely-sensed and in situ datasets (including hydrological, altimetry, digital elevation model, bathymetry, aerial photo, optical imagery, and radar imagery data) available to different degrees in the Niger-South hydrological area were systematically integrated to draw maximum benefits from all available data. Retrospective modelling, calibration, and validation were undertaken for the whole Niger- South hydrological catchment area of Nigeria, and then these data were segmented into sub-domains for re-validation to understand how data variability and uncertainties impact the accuracy of model outcomes. Furthermore, aerial photos were applied for the first time in the study area for flood model validation and for understanding how different physio-environmental properties influenced the synthetic aperture radar flood delineation capacity in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study demonstrates how the complementary strengths of open, readily available geospatial datasets and tools can be leveraged to model and map flooding within acceptable levels of uncertainty for flood risk management.

TI  - Perspectives Of The Antipsoriatic Heliotherapy In Poland
JO  - Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Statistical analysis of the daily course of exposures to TL-01 tube radiation for 93 psoriatic patients from the Medical University of Łódź during 20-day phototherapy shows that the dose of 1 J/cm2 represents a unit of single exposure necessary for psoriasis healing. This value is converted to the antipsoriatic effective dose of 317.9 J/m2 using the TL-01 lamp irradiance spectrum and the antipsoriatic action spectrum. It is proposed that the daily exposure of 317.9 J/m2 serves as the standard antipsoriatic dose (SAPD) providing a link between the cabinet and the out-door exposures and it could be used for planning heliotherapy in Poland. A model is proposed to calculate ambient antipsoriatic doses for 3 h exposures around the local noon (9 am-12 am GMT) based on satellite measurements of ozone and cloud characteristics. The model constants are determined by a comparison with pertaining antipsoriatic doses measured by the Brewer spectrophotometer in central Poland. It is found that 3 h exposures to solar radiation in the period 15 May-15 September provides the mean (2005-2013) doses in the range 2.7-3.1 SAPD over Poland. Thus, heliotherapy could be treated as an alternative to the cabinet phototherapy for almost 4 months. It seems that the most effective site for antipsoriatic heliotherapy is the south/east part of Poland (the Bieszczady Mountains). The heliotherapy could be carried out in existing national health centers equipped with the standard easy-to-use biometers for on-line monitoring of UV level and controlling duration of sunbathing to avoid erythema risks. It is even possible to control the antipsoriatic heliotherapy by a patient himself, using low-cost hand-held instruments measuring UV index. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantifying The Urban Gradient: A Practical Method For Broad Measurements
JO  - Landscape and Urban Planning
PY  - 2014
AB  - The process of habitat urbanization has intense and manifold effects on the biota that we need to better understand. The urbanization gradient approach is increasingly used in ecological research to study the responses of communities and populations of plants and animals to different degrees of landscape urbanization. However, the methods used for quantifying the urbanization gradient are heterogeneous. Here, first we validate a manual method designed for broad measures of landscape urbanization, based on major land-cover characteristics calculated from aerial images, that has been applied in former studies, and compare its results to measurements taken with a widely accepted geoinformatics software. Second, on the basis of this manual scoring method we introduce a recently developed, easily feasible, semi-automated method of measuring degree of urbanization, which uses only freely and worldwide accessible satellite imagery. Finally, we compare the results obtained by the three methods and the conclusions they yield within the framework of an ecological study conducted on birds. Our results show that the three methods quantify the urbanization gradient similarly, as the 'urbanization scores' they provide are strongly correlated and the results of the ecological analyses are highly repeatable across the three approaches. Since the semi-automated method grants this performance at far the lowest cost of time, we propose it as a useful tool for broad measurements of urbanization and its application can promote greater integrity between studies of urbanization effects on wildlife around the world. We also provide a download link to the free application of our semi-automated method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Development Of Airborne Remote Sensing System For Crop Pest Management: System Integration And Verification
JO  - Applied Engineering in Agriculture
PY  - 2009
AB  - Remote sensing is being used with Global Positioning Systems, Geographic Information Systems, and variable rate technology to ultimately help farmers maximize the economic and environmental benefits of crop pest management through precision agriculture. Airborne remote sensing is flexible and versatile because fields can be flown at variable altitude depending on the spatial resolution required. Although the use of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing in agricultural research and applications has been steadily increasing in the last decade, the airborne multispectral technique is still a good source of crop, soil, or ground cover information. The MS-4100 is a multispectral camera that produces and aligns images from different bands with a built-in prism. Data can be analyzed from the composite image or individual band images. The camera system evaluated herein uses a camera control system to physically compensate for roll, pitch, and yaw and maintain the camera at vertical nadir orientation. This article describes the automated airborne multi-spectral imaging system and image processing using sample imagery to demonstrate the capability and potential of the system for crop pest management.

TI  - Performance And Economic Analysis Of A 27 Kw Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System In Suriname
JO  - IET Renewable Power Generation
PY  - 2017
AB  - The performance of a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, under the Surinamese weather conditions, is monitored and reported. A measurement and data-logging system provides inputs for the calculation of selected standard key performance indicators (KPI). Calculated KPI's are compared to expected values obtained from modelling the system using the PVSyst software. In addition, results from selected comparable studies are also used to compare the computed KPI's. Using one year data, the annual energy yield (Eac) totalled 37 MWh. This value is 6% higher than the one obtained from the modelling software. The calculated performance ratio (PR) and capacity factor (CF) of 74.5 and 15.5%, respectively, are also higher than the ones obtained from PVSyst. The difference can be attributed to the irradiance data (satellite data, monthly averages) used for input in the PVSyst software. The above mentioned calculated values for the PR and CF compared favourably with internationally reported values for systems located in regions with similar weather patterns. Using a total investment cost of 109,000 USD the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) calculated with the RETScreen software equals USD 0.36 /kWh. This LCOE is three times the current energy price in Suriname. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.

TI  - Projecting Future Land Use/Land Cover By Integrating Drivers And Plan Prescriptions: The Case For Watershed Applications
JO  - GISCIENCE \& REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Watershed planning is a pivotal exercise for all jurisdictions irrespective of size, landscape complexity, or other nuances. As a result of the intricate relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and water resources, it becomes prudent to not only develop historical and contemporary LULC data for watershed planning purposes, but more importantly, the production of future LULC datasets has the potential to better inform watershed planners. This study explored an optimal workflow that can be adopted for the production of baseline LULC input images from a moderate spatial resolution sensor such as Landsat, and the identification, translation, and configuration of land change drivers and regional comprehensive plan prescriptions in the creation of future LULC data for a regional watershed. The study conducted in the Lower Chippewa River Watershed, Wisconsin, USA demonstrated that an object-based hybrid classification approach resulted in the generation of improved projected images with a 15\% increase in area under the curve (AUC) value compared to a pixel-based hybrid classification method even though both methods displayed comparable overall image classification accuracies (<= 1.8\%). Results further displayed that configuring anthropogenic drivers in a trend format rather than individual year values can result in a more efficient training of a multi-layer perceptron neural network - Markov Chain model. The calibrated and validated model demonstrated that on average, residential, commercial, institutional, green vegetation/shrub, and industrial LULC are expected to grow through 2050, though at a slower rate (12\%) compared to contemporary period (39\%), while forest and agricultural lands are slated to decline (-2\%).

TI  - Regional Distribution Of Salt-Rich Dust Across Southwest Asia Based On Predictive Soil-Geomorphic Mapping Techniques
PY  - 2016
AB  - Understanding the source regions of soluble salt-rich dust is critical for military operations, monitoring potential environmental health impacts to military personnel, and for mitigating abrasion and corrosion to military material operating in desert regions. Arid regions are characterized by saline soils which are formed by a lack of precipitation and influenced by surrounding and underlying geology, among other factors. The dust content in soils and surface sediments in southwest Asia is commonly associated with specific landforms. This paper uses a soil-geomorphic conceptual model that integrates geographic datasets of Landsat imagery, soil and landforms, precipitation data, and geologic maps to produce derivative map-based predictions of the spatial distribution and content of salt-rich dust-sized particle in soils and surface sediments in the region. The derivative map is based on three regional dust and salt content maps and the assignment of a five-fold rating class and numerical factor value system to individual map polygons {[}e. g., Very High (5), High (4), Moderate (3), Low (2), Very Low (1)]. The three regional maps include: (1) dust content based on the identification of distinct landform assemblages from 15-m resolution compressed LANDSAT TM+ imagery at a scale of 1: 750,000, (2) salt content developed from 1 km2-resolution mean annual precipitation data, and (3) geologic-based salt content developed from published geologic maps. This study presents an initial step towards the prediction of salt-rich dust sources at regional scales that is aimed to provide information to planning military operations and for mitigating the hazards of dust on military personnel and equipment operating in desert regions. The approach used to predict dust and salt sources could also be used to refine atmospheric dust loading models that require knowledge of the spatial distribution of geomorphic-based input parameters.

TI  - Cost And Logistics Of Alternative Roll-Out Options For Implementing Human Papillomavirus Testing As A Triage In Cervical Screening: Results Of The Sentinel Sites Study
JO  - British Journal of Cancer
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Previous studies have indicated that human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as a triage for managing equivocal cytology is cost-effective. The aim of this study was to assess the costs of alternative roll-out options. Methods: Detailed cost estimates were collected from six laboratories where HPV triage had been implemented. Costs were assessed for the two different service delivery models that were implemented; a hub and spoke model of central HPV testing in a microbiology laboratory with separate cytology laboratories, and an integrated model where HPV testing was conducted within the cytology laboratory. Results: Comparison of alternative delivery models indicated that setting up HPV processing within existing cytology laboratory, i.e., an integrated cytology/HPV laboratory generated savings in staff time amounting to between £2.54 and 4.86 per sample processed. Running full HPV testing batches was also an important consideration. For full batches to be run on a twice weekly basis requies having no more than two laboratories per Strategic Health Authority.Conclusions:To be cost-efficient, and to meet turn-around times, HPV testing needs to be conducted at integrated cytology/HPV testing centres with sufficient throughput to run full batches of HPV tests. © 2012 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.

TI  - Jointly Developed Fcc Catalysts With Novel Mesoporous Zeolite Deliver Higher Yields And Economic Value To Refiners
JO  - NPRA Annual Meeting Technical Papers
PY  - 2011
AB  - Rive Technology Inc and Grace Davison Refining Technologies jointly developed the Rive's Molecular Highway™ technology, which makes traditional zeolite catalysts more capable of cracking large hydrocarbon molecules. It improves on zeolite Y by creating a network of intermediate sized (2-6 nm) mesoporous " molecular highways" throughout the crystals of zeolite Y. These "molecular highways" admit and pre-crack even the largest feed molecules, while also channeling product gasoline and diesel molecules safely out of the zeolite. This new catalyst is a drop-in replacement for current catalysts and will enable refiners to increase throughput and profitability without capital investment. A discussion covers the Rive™ zeolite technology; its incorporation into a Grace proprietary catalyst matrix formulation; preparations for a first refinery trial; and the benefits of Rive™ zeolite mesoporosity. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the NPRA 2011 Annual Meeting (San Antonio, TX 3/21/2011).

TI  - Submerged Macrophyte Assessment In Rivers: An Automatic Mapping Method Using Pléiades Imagery
JO  - Water Research
PY  - 2020
AB  - Submerged macrophyte monitoring is a major concern for hydrosystem management, particularly for understanding and preventing the potential impacts of global change on ecological functions and services. Macrophyte distribution assessments in rivers are still primarily realized using field monitoring or manual photo-interpretation of aerial images. Considering the lack of applications in fluvial environments, developing operational, low-cost and less time-consuming tools able to automatically map and monitor submerged macrophyte distribution is therefore crucial to support effective management programs. In this study, the suitability of very fine-scale resolution (50 cm) multispectral Pléiades satellite imagery to estimate submerged macrophyte cover, at the scale of a 1 km river section, was investigated. The performance of nonparametric regression methods (based on two reliable and well-known machine learning algorithms for remote sensing applications, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression) were compared for several spectral datasets, testing the relevance of 4 spectral bands (red, green, blue and near-infrared) and two vegetation indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI, and the Green-Red Vegetation Index, GRVI), and for several field sampling configurations. Both machine learning algorithms applied to a Pléiades image were able to reasonably well predict macrophyte cover in river ecosystems with promising performance metrics (R² above 0.7 and RMSE around 20%). The Random Forest algorithm combined to the 4 spectral bands from Pléiades image was the most efficient, particularly for extreme cover values (0% and 100%). Our study also demonstrated that a larger number of fine-scale field sampling entities clearly involved better cover predictions than a smaller number of larger sampling entities. © 2020

TI  - Perceived Influence Of Street-Level Visible Greenness Exposure In The Work And Residential Environment On Life Satisfaction: Evidence From Beijing, China
JO  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
PY  - 2021
AB  - Sensing urban greenness from street view data offers a new and alternative way of measuring the association between greenness exposure and subjective wellbeing in developing countries where traditional census data are poor. This paper focuses on the association between life satisfaction and street-level visible greenness exposure at residential and work locations, using a combination of sensor data and individual cross-sectional survey data (4619 employed respondents) in Beijing, China. We use a single self-reported question (‘“how well are you satisfied with your life as a whole”’) to measure life satisfaction. Street View Greenness (SVG) is taken as a surrogate for street-level visible greenness exposure at residential and work locations. The results suggest that street-level visible greenness exposure in residential locations is positively associated with perceived satisfaction, though such effects are less significant after considering greenness exposure at work locations. The stratified analysis provides the insight that the associations between street-level visible greenness exposure and life satisfaction vary with individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristics such as sex, age educational attainment and income. Males, young adults, people with low income and educational attainment may benefit more from SVG exposure than other groups. Findings of this study suggest that urban greenness in residential and work environments should simultaneously be taken into the design of land use and public policies aiming to improve people's subjective wellbeing. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Calibration Facility For Analysing Locational And Detectability Accuracies Of Ground Penetrating Radar
JO  - 35th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2014, ACRS 2014: Sensing for Reintegration of Societies
PY  - 2014
AB  - Underground infrastructure mapping is an engineering practice that often used for acquiring the as-built information of the buried infrastructure at the urban and suburban areas. It is crucial to acquire the as-built information of these underground infrastructures because this information is constructive for sustainable development of the urban underground land, especially when there are increasing demand of housing and infrastructure in today's era. As a result to this circumstance, majority of the urban underground land has been expropriated to different categories of buried infrastructures (e.g.: utility features, tunnels, transportation, etc.) as a final frontier for urban development. Securing the as-built information of these underground infrastructures is hence substantial for the urban infrastructure planning in the future. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of a calibration test site for analysing the locational and detectability accuracies in urban infrastructure mapping. In achieving this, the design of the calibration test site incorporates the needs and requirements of the mapping industry in order to build a better mapping practice in current engineering sectors. All the details of the design and implementation of the calibration test site for analysing the locational and detectability accuracies are specified in this paper. Due to its well-designed structures, including the arrangement and alignment of the buried utilities, this calibration test site can serve as the medium for correlating the underground infrastructures with the real world geophysical anomalies with no doubt. It is hence practical and profitable for geotechnical and applications, civil and environmental engineering studies, mining exploration as well as archaeological surveys. Thereby, such testing site is certainly has the potential to provide unlimited contributions to the advancement of engineering sectors in the future, particularly in the field of underground infrastructure mapping for ensuring the sustainable development of urban underground land.

TI  - Advanced Data Management System (Adams) For Earth Observation In Restricted Access Areas
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2013
AB  - Earth observation is too often related to the assumption that the environment can be adequately monitored via remote sensing assets. However, this is not realistic in restricted access areas (e.g. the Arctic region) where, to collect data points, the space-borne sources alone cannot ensure a sufficient monitoring process. As a consequence, the common approach is to collect data from a variety of sources (both from space and "in-situ") and to display it via a web platform or proprietary software, in the form of multi-layer high-utility maps (i.e. for disaster management and/or situational awareness). The existing monitoring systems for restricted access regions are all affected by the same limitation: for each parameter of interest they collect data points from different sources but, because they consider all the sources as independent, they end up displaying a number of maps equal to the number of sources. As a consequence, redundant maps to visualize a single parameter are built (e.g. one map could show the temperature profile given by a space instrument while another map could display the temperature profile in the same area relying on data points collected by one "in-situ" instrument). Generally, these maps are graphically overlapped to provide users with the "best effort" situational awareness. However, when more superimposed maps are displayed for the same parameter, problems with interpretation and responsiveness of decision-making process are likely to happen. To solve this limitation, an "Advanced Data Management System" (ADAMS) has been proposed. Its novelty factor is the integration and merging of data points, coming from both quantitative and qualitative sources, to build a single comprehensive map for each discrete parameter (e.g. the temperature coming from four different data sources must be integrated and merged to build one single temperature profile map). With regard to quantitative parameters, the ADAMS is not only able to merge them in a mathematically efficient way, but it is also capable of excluding inaccurate inputs via a comparative recognition procedure; concerning qualitative parameters, ADAMS takes into account precise norms and procedures to convert the qualitative knowledge into quantitative information, via a combination of the fuzzy logic approach with the dual truth model. To create reliable maps, ADAMS recognizes that a quantitative-born value is intrinsically more accurate and precise than a qualitative-born data converted to the quantitative domain. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

TI  - A Dynamic Analysis Of Regional Land Use And Cover Changing (Lucc) By Remote Sensing And Gis -Taking Fuzhou Area As Example
PY  - 2010
AB  - Regional difference of environmental evolvements is one of important aspects in world change research program. Changes in land cover and in the way people use the land have become recognized as important global environmental change in many areas. Land-use and cover changing (LUCC) is one of the major studies of global changing lately. Land-use is the term which covers the condition of used-land, the method, extent, structure, regional distributing and benefits in the land-use. It is affected by the natural condition or is enslaved to the conditions in society, economy and technology, and social production mode plays a decisive role in land-use; land-cover is the state of covering which is formed on account of the earth's surface or contrived by human being, is the summary of vegetation and artificially covering on the earth's surface. So land-use and cover changing is connecting closely. Land-use and cover changing information points that information on the position, distributing, range, and size of land-use and cover changing in the certain time. Motivated by a global concern for sustainability and environmental quality in city, a considerable number of studies have utilized satellite sensor data in the analysis of urban morphological change. some studies focused on the physical and socioeconomic drivers of change in urban land cover and implications on land use practices and resource management. Other studies went beyond the characterization of change and its causes and attempted to integrate remotely sensed data with models of urban growth to project future change. GIS and RS technologies are widely applied for LUCC studies providing a powerful tool for capturing, storing, checking manipulating, merging, analyzing and displaying data. Especially RS technology are also widely used for LUCC studies such as automatic discovery changing, automatic extraction changing area, confirmation changing type, using interactive explanation accessorily to extract the changing information of land-use in the research area. RS has an important contribution to make in the actual change in LUCC on regional. This paper studies land-use and land-cover change in Fuzhou area of Fujian Province, China. It builds a series of land-use change maps using Remote Sensing automatic monitoring and GIS spatial analysis techniques. Finally the paper briefly discusses the drive of land-use and cover changes. The study provides a reference to the sustainable development for the region.

TI  - Examining The Value Of Satellite Data In Halting Transmission Of Polio In Nigeria: A Socioeconomic Analysis
JO  - DATA \& POLICY
PY  - 2023
AB  - In 2014, Nigeria halted transmission of wild poliovirus for the first time in its history. A critical enabling component in this historic achievement was the use of satellite data to produce more accurate maps and population estimates used in planning and implementing vaccination campaigns. This article employs a value-of-information approach to estimate the net socioeconomic benefits associated with this use of satellite data. We calculate the increase in the likelihood of halting transmission of polio associated with the use of satellite-based information compared to traditional data sources, and we consider the benefits associated with savings to the healthcare system as well as health benefits. Using a conservative approach focused on just 1 year of benefits, we estimate net socioeconomic benefits of between \$46.0 million and \$153.9 million. In addition to these quantified benefits, we also recognize qualitative benefits associated with improving human health, reaching marginalized communities, and building capacity among local populations. We also explore the substantial benefits associated with follow-on projects that have made use of the satellite-based data products and methodologies originally developed for the Nigeria polio eradication effort.

TI  - On-Site Cycling Drag Analysis With The Ring Of Fire
JO  - EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Ring of Fire (RoF) measurement concept, introduced by Terra et al. (Exp Fluids 58:83. 10.1007/s00348-017-2331-0, 2017; Experiments in Fluids 59:120, 2018), is applied to real cyclists to enable the aerodynamic drag determination during sport action. This principle is based on large-scale stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements over a plane crossed by the athlete during cycling. The momentum before and after the passage of the athlete poses the basis for the control volume analysis in the athlete's frame of reference, which returns the aerodynamic drag. This approach extrapolates aerodynamic studies towards more realistic conditions, compared to experiments performed in wind tunnels with scaled or stationary athletes. The measurement concept is termed Ring of Fire as the rider crosses a region of intense light. Two experiments are conducted, indoor and outdoor, with attention placed on the effects of the environmental conditions and the confinement of the measurement region. Stereo-PIV measurements feature a plane of approximately 2x2m(2), using neutrally buoyant sub-millimeter helium-filled soap bubbles (HFSB) as flow tracers. The drag measurement is obtained examining the wake produced by the athlete. It is observed that the drag value becomes independent of time after about 5 torso lengths from the passage. A statistical estimate of the drag is produced combining the results of several passages. Fluctuations of the drag value during a single passage are associated with the unsteady wake flow. Overall fluctuations among different transits are ascribed to the varying conditions of the airflow prior to the passage of the athlete. The experiments conducted outdoor exhibit significantly larger dispersion of the drag value, compared to the quieter conditions indoor. Repetition of the transit 10-30 times yields a basis for statistical convergence of the average drag value. The flow topology past the cyclist compares satisfactorily between both experiments and with wind tunnel experiments reported in literature. The current measurements clearly separate drag values from upright and time-trial athlete's positions, indicating the suitability of this principle for aerodynamic analysis and optimization studies. {[}GRAPHICS] .

TI  - Socioeconomic Cost Of Dredge Boat Gold Mining In The Tapajós Basin, Eastern Amazon
JO  - Resources Policy
PY  - 2022
AB  - With the rapid expansion of artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Brazilian Amazon, an increasing number of studies have attempted to estimate the impacts and socio-environmental costs of ASGM using economic valuation methods. However, most studies focused on alluvial gold mining and few examined dredge boat mining, leading to an under-estimation of the overall impact of ASGM in some regions. The objective of the present study was to develop a methodology for assessing the socio-environmental costs of dredge boat mining in the Tapajós watershed. We developed a method linking the type of gold mining, type of pump, motor power required, time spent in exploration, and mercury use with the average socioeconomic cost. We identified 13 boats in the Tapajós basin in 2020 using satellite images. The total socioeconomic cost of dredge boat mining was US $6.4 million in 2020 (i.e., US $142,556 per kilogram of gold or US $588,887 per ferry). The estimated dredging impact cost may reach US $14.7 million for an optimistic scenario, which would reach US $443.9 million when considering accumulated impact over 30 years. These findings can contribute to a more accurate economic valuation of illegal dredge boat mining, providing valuable information for estimating compensation fines and planning law enforcement investments to prevent illegal ASGM. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessment Of Land Surface Temperature Variations And Implications Of Land Use/Land Cover Changes: A Case Of Malappuram Urban Agglomeration Region, Kerala, India
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urbanization is taking place faster, and urban air temperatures are gradually rising in all cities across the world. Uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization leads to constant environmental threats and can alter local and regional climates. According to the survey published by Economist Intelligence Unit, in India, Keralas Malappuram district ranks first among the fastest-growing urban areas globally, with a 44.05\% growth rate. Hence, the present study aims to identify the hotspot regions of extreme heat within the Malappuram urban agglomeration region and suggest strategies for its improvement. The split-window algorithm retrieved land surface temperature (LST) for 1991, 1998, 2014, and 2020 using Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 satellite imageries. A rising trend in LST has been detected in the last 30 years, and the mean value has increased by 1.70 \& DEG;C within the region. Among the selected hotspots, an LST increase of 1.84 \& DEG;C was observed for those areas with the highest increase in urban density with decreased vegetation. The increasing impact of urbanization and the subsequent change in land use patterns at the cost of greenery have caused a substantial effect on the local climate. Accordingly, planning and policy directions are proposed for the local government that can help provide awareness to the people through the effective implementation of mitigation measures.

TI  - Circularity: Fostering Efficiency Of Developing Economies
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2020
AB  - Environmental pollution due to increasing waste flows is on top of the global agenda. Many developing countries including Russia address this issue by investing in waste treatment facilities. They give little regard to circular economy principles which are gaining prominence in advanced countries. Lack of detailed information on waste flows limits waste management system analysis best practices applicability in these countries. We developed a framework for waste generation analysis during the life cycle based on data available for Russia. For production waste analysis, we base on waste input-output methodology to distinguish between direct and indirect waste flows attributable to the final demand. For consumption waste, we used expert estimate to allocate the amount of municipal solid waste to each group of industries. We put together the information on waste during production and consumption to assess resource efficiency of output during the life cycle. We divide waste flows into those resulting from structural and technological resource inefficiency. Structural inefficiency results from overall resource orientation of Russian economy. Extraction waste represents more than a half of all waste generated and is mainly attributable to export. An example of technological inefficiency within an industry is waste generation in foods and agriculture sector which is 7 times higher per unit of value added than the respective indicator for Great Britain. The framework may serve to identify key resource leakages in an economy. Further analysis of resource industries should be followed by the development of address measures and respective KPIs to boost resource efficiency at industrial and product levels. This is crucial for running complex waste management policy based on circular economy principles. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Overview Of Methods Used To Assess Vegetation Condition At The Scale Of The Site
JO  - Ecological Management and Restoration
PY  - 2006
AB  - Rapid, on-ground assessments of vegetation condition are frequently used as a basis for landholder education, development applications, distributing incentive funds, prescribing restoration treatments and monitoring change. We provide an overview of methods used to rapidly assess vegetation condition for these purposes. We encourage those developing new approaches to work through the steps we have presented here, namely define management objectives and operational constraints; develop an appropriate conceptual framework for the ecosystems under consideration; select an appropriate suite of indicators; and consider the options available for combining these into an index. We argue that information must be gained from broader scales to make decisions about the condition of individual sites. Remote sensing and spatial modelling might be more appropriate methods than on-ground assessments for obtaining this information. However, we believe that spatial prediction of vegetation condition will only add value to on-ground assessments rather than replace them. This is because the current techniques for spatially predicting vegetation condition cannot capture all of the information in a site assessment or at the required level of accuracy, and maps cannot replace the exchange of information between assessors and land managers that is an important component of on-ground assessment. There is scope for more sophistication in the way on-ground assessments of vegetation condition are undertaken, but the challenge will be to maintain the simplicity that makes rapid on-ground assessment a popular vehicle for informing natural resource management. We encourage greater peer review and publishing in this field to facilitate greater exchange of ideas and experiences. © 2006 The Authors.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Land Use Changes Along The <I>Xin</I>'<I>An</I> River Watershed For Supporting Water Quality Investigation For Potential Fishing Grounds In <I>Qiandao Lake</I>, China
PY  - 2014
AB  - It is estimated that more than 20,000 natural lakes are found across China. Most of these lakes are undergoing eutrophication or other severe environmental nuisances owing to natural and/or anthropogenic processes. In order to prevent or to minimize such damaging impacts, and to ascertain a proper quality management of the lake water and the associated fish resources, it is required to have access to up-to-date, accurate, and relevant data and information on the aquatic ecosystem in a timely manner. The "Dragon 3" project, supported by the European Space Agency, is focusing on Xin'an river watershed and investigates the impact of water quality and land cover/use change on the spatio-temporal distribution of the fishing grounds in Qiandao Lake. In this paper, the land use changes derived from satellite images is presented. Initially, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 LDCM have been analyzed for the last 20 years in the vicinity of the Xin'an river watershed. Following the radiometric calibration of the images, several pixel-base classification algorithms have been evaluated including Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well Neural Network (NN). As it was found using the multi-temporal satellite imagery, the SVM algorithm was able to give high kappa accuracy estimated at around 0.90. In addition EO-Hyperion images over the western part of the Xin'an River were evaluated using hyperspectral vegetation indices as well using linear spectral un-mixing techniques. In addition, ENVISAT radar images have been evaluated in terms of land use change. The final outcomes indicate a significant urban expansion in the surrounding area of the Xin'an River which impacts the water quality investigation. Finally, a Landsat image was processed in order to estimate the Trophic State Index (TSI) values over the water bodies and the highest values were observed over the Xin'an river watershed and more specifically for the urban sites.

TI  - Uncovering Regional Variability In Disturbance Trends Between Parks And Greater Park Ecosystems Across Canada (1985–2015)
JO  - Scientific Reports
PY  - 2019
AB  - We assess the protective function of Canada’s parks and protected areas (PPAs) by analyzing three decades of stand-replacing disturbance derived from Landsat time series data (1985–2015). Specifically, we compared rates of wildfire and harvest within 1,415 PPAs against rates of disturbance in surrounding greater park ecosystems (GPEs). We found that disturbance rates in GPEs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in corresponding PPAs in southern managed forests (six of Canada’s 12 forested ecozones). Higher disturbance rates in GPEs were attributed to harvesting activities, as the area impacted by wildfire was not significantly different between GPEs and PPAs in any ecozone. The area burned within PPAs and corresponding GPEs was highly correlated (r = 0.90), whereas the area harvested was weakly correlated (r = 0.19). The average area burned in PPAs/GPEs below 55° N was low (0.05% yr−1) largely due to fire suppression aimed at protecting communities, timber, and recreational values, while the average burn rate was higher in northern PPAs/GPEs where fire suppression is uncommon (0.40% yr−1 in PPAs/GPEs above 55° N). Assessing regional variability in disturbance patterns and the pressures faced by PPAs can better inform policy and protection goals across Canada and the globe. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - New Ocean, New Needs: Application Of Pteropod Shell Dissolution As A Biological Indicator For Marine Resource Management
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2017
AB  - Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Ωar causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Ωar > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Ωar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Ωar < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail; the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socio-economic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem-based management, policy development, and regulatory applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ecological Correlates Of Blue Whale Movement Behavior And Its Predictability In The California Current Ecosystem During The Summer-Fall Feeding Season
JO  - MOVEMENT ECOLOGY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Species distribution models have shown that blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) occur seasonally in high densities in the most biologically productive regions of the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). Satellite telemetry studies have additionally shown that blue whales in the CCE regularly switch between behavioral states consistent with area-restricted searching (ARS) and transiting, indicative of foraging in and moving among prey patches, respectively. However, the relationship between the environmental correlates that serve as a proxy of prey relative to blue whale movement behavior has not been quantitatively assessed. Methods: We investigated the association between blue whale behavioral state and environmental predictors in the coastal environments of the CCE using a long-term satellite tracking data set (72 tagged whales; summer-fall months 1998-2008), and predicted the likelihood of ARS behavior at tracked locations using nonparametric multiplicative regression models. The models were built using data from years of cool, productive conditions and validated against years of warm, low-productivity conditions. Results: The best model contained four predictors: chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperature, and seafloor aspect and depth. This model estimated highest ARS likelihood (> 0.8) in areas with high chlorophyll-a levels (> 0.65 mg/m(3)), intermediatesea surface temperatures (11.6-17.5 degrees C), and shallow depths (< 850 m). Overall, the model correctly predicted behavioral state throughout the coastal environments of the CCE, while the validation indicated an ecosystem-wide reduction in ARS likelihood during warm years, especially in the southern portion. For comparison, a spatial coordinates model (longitude x latitude) performed slightly better than the environmental model during warm years, providing further evidence that blue whales exhibit strong foraging site fidelity, even when conditions are not conducive to successful foraging. Conclusions: We showed that blue whale behavioral state in the CCE was predictable from environmental correlates and that ARS behavior was most prevalent in regions of known high whale density, likely reflecting where large prey aggregations consistently develop in summer-fall. Our models of whale movement behavior enhanced our understanding of species distribution by further indicating where foraging was more likely, which could be of value in the identification of key regions of importance for endangered species in management considerations. The models also provided evidence that decadal-scale environmental fluctuations can drive shifts in the distribution and foraging success of this blue whale population.

TI  - Use Of Remote Sensing, Gis And C++ For Soil Erosion Assessment In The Shakkar River Basin, India
JO  - Hydrological Sciences Journal
PY  - 2017
AB  - Soil is an essential resource for human livelihoods. Soil erosion is now a global environmental crisis that threatens the natural environment and agriculture. This study aimed to assess the annual rate of soil erosion using distributed information for topography, land use and soil, with a remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) approach and comparison of simulated with observed sediment loss. The Shakkar River basin, situated in the Narsinghpur and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, was selected for this study. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) with RS and GIS was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil erosion occurring in the study area on a grid-cell basis. Thematic maps of rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop/cover management factor (C), and conservation/support practice factor (P) were prepared using annual rainfall data, soil map, digital elevation model (DEM) and an executable C++ program, and a satellite image of the study area in the GIS environment. The annual rate of soil erosion was estimated for a 15-year period (1992–2006) and was found to vary between 6.45 and 13.74 t ha−1 year−1, with an average annual rate of 9.84 t ha−1 year−1. The percentage deviation between simulated and observed values varies between 2.68% and 18.73%, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.874. © 2016 IAHS.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics Prediction And Driving Factors Analysis Of Npp In Shanxi Province Covering The Period 2001-2020
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - The advent of a range of high-precision NPP products, including MODIS NPP, MOD17 NPP, and GIMMS NPP, has sparked growing interest in the study of Earth's ecosystems. In order to enhance comprehension of ecosystem health, in order to facilitate the development of rational resource management and environmental conservation policies, this investigation employs the MOD17A3 dataset to analyze historical variations in Net Primary Productivity (NPP) within Shanxi Province from 2001 to 2020, while also exploring future trends. The Theil-Sen median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test are commonly used methods for analyzing time series data, employed to study the spatiotemporal trends and variations in NPP. The Grey Wolf Optimization-Support Vector Machine (GWO-SVM) model combines optimization algorithms and machine learning methods, enhancing the predictive capacity of the model for future NPP time series changes. Conversely, the Hurst exponent utilizes historical NPP trends to assess the persistence characteristics of NPP and predict future spatial variations in NPP. This study additionally investigates the natural driving factors of NPP using the Geographic Detector approach. The key findings of this study are as follows. (1) Overall, NPP in Shanxi Province exhibits a fluctuating upward trend from 2001 to 2020, with an average value of 206.278 gCm(-2)a(-1). Spatially, NPP exhibits a northwest-low and southeast-high pattern, with significant spatial heterogeneity and considerable variability. (2) The average Hurst exponent is 0.86, indicating a characteristic of strong persistence in growth in future NPP. Regions with strong or higher persistent growth account for 95.54\% of the total area. (3) According to the CMIP6 climate scenarios, NPP is projected to gradually increase from 2025 to 2030. (4) The interactive effects between natural factors contribute more to NPP variations than individual factors, with the rainfall-elevation interaction having the highest contribution percentage.

TI  - Research On The Spatiotemporal Coupling Relationships Between Land Use/Land Cover Compositions Or Patterns And The Surface Urban Heat Island Effect
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization leads to changes in landscape configuration and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns, and these changes are important factors affecting the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. However, from the perspective of spatiotemporal changes, quantitative analytical results regarding the impacts of the LULC composition, configuration, and pattern in inland plateau lakeside cities on the SUHI effect, and the responsive relationships among these factors remain unclear. By combining satellite remote sensing data with analytical methods, such as urban-rural gradients, spatial statistics, and landscape pattern indices, the impacts of LULC changes on the SUHI effect in Kunming, China, are revealed. The results show the following. (1) The explosive growth in impervious surfaces (ISs) caused by urbanization, leading to changes in the LULC composition, configuration and pattern, is the main reason for the deterioration of the SUHI effect. Over the past 30 years, Kunming's ISs have increased by 304.58 km(2), SUHI has expanded by 764.26 km(2), and the regional average land surface temperature (LST) has increased by 1 degrees C. (2) This study also found that a large area of bare ground is another important reason for the sharp rise in LST, explaining why bare land (BL) has the highest average LST (28.72 degrees C). (3) The pattern of LULC can well explain the spatial distribution characteristics of SUHIs. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI), and LST have the same change curve along the urban-rural gradient, while the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and LST have opposite trends. (4) ISs and water body (WB) are the main types of warming and cooling, respectively, but the warming effect of ISs is greater than the cooling effect of WB. From the average value of the correlation coefficient with LST, NDBI (0.84) > MNDWI (-0.63). (5) Kunming's remote sensing index values do not have simple linear relationships with the LST. NDBaI, NDBI, and LST show significant exponential relationships, and NDVI, MNDWI, and LST show significant quadratic polynomial relationships. (6) The dominant landscape type determines the correlation between the landscape shape index (LSI) and the LST of green spaces (GSs). (7) Adopting a simple and regular landscape layout can effectively reduce the SUHI effect. These research results could provide a scientific decision-making basis for the spatial urban planning and ecological construction of Kunming and could have practical significance for guiding the green, healthy, and sustainable development of the city.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation And Provincial Scale Differences Of The Aod Across China During 2000-2021
JO  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - The spatiotemporal variation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China was studied using MODIS data retrieved with the MAIAC algorithm. Time series were extended to July 2021. The study area is defined as the mainland of South-Eastern China Below the Hu line, with Hebei as the most northerly province (in short SECBH) and includes 16 provinces, 4 central government-controlled municipalities and one autonomous region, all referred to here as provinces. The extended time series and provincial-scale averaging of the AOD provide more detailed and new information on the spatiotemporal variation across the SECBH. Differences in temporal behaviour are observed between the north, central-south and south of the SEBCH. The AOD increased in southern China before it increased in the northern provinces. The AOD was high between 2006 and 2014, with strong interannual fluctuations in response to the emission reduction policy opposed by economic developments, and decreased significantly from 2013/2014, in response to the Clean Air Action Plan (2013-2017). However, during the period 2017-2020 the AOD stabilized and fluctuated within 10\% of the average value for these years which was similar to, and in part of the study area lower than, the AOD in 2000. Exceptions are Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and part of Shandong, where the AOD in 2020 was slightly higher than in 2000. The extension of the AOD time series until July 2021 shows that earlier derived trends do not continue and the emission reduction policy needs to be extended to achieve the earlier air quality goals.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations Of Pm2.5 Concentrations And Related Premature Deaths In Asia, Africa, And Europe From 2000 To 2018
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
PY  - 2023
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is one of leading environmental problems worldwide, posing a serious threat to global public health. Based on long-time series of satellite-retrieved PM2.5 concentrations, this study estimated premature deaths from six diseases (acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes (DIA), ischemic heart disease (IHD), lung cancer (LNC), and stroke (STR)) attributable to PM2.5 in Asia, Africa, and Europe (AAE). The results showed that the 19-year average population-weighted PM2.5 concentration in AAE was 41.7 mu g/m3, with 47.4, 33.9, and 15.5 mu g/m3 for Asia, Africa, and Europe, respectively. In AAE, the total annual average premature deaths related to PM2.5 were 2819 thousand (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2348-4021), with 2261 thousand (95\% CI: 1880-3396) in Asia, 170 thousand (95\% CI: 128-276) in Africa, and 388 thousand (95\% CI: 305-599) in Europe. STR and IHD were the major contributors to premature deaths in AAE, accounting for 38.5\% and 33.3\%, respectively. DIA, as a newly considered disease, was responsible for 4.8\% premature deaths of the total. Besides, high values of premature deaths were concentrated in China and India during 2000-2018, with 1228 thousand (95\% CI: 912-1922) and 506 thousand (95\% CI: 389-720) annual average premature deaths (43.6\% and 17.9\% of the total in AAE). The results of this study provide a reference for different countries in AAE to formulate PM2.5 pollution control strategies.

TI  - Spatial Patterns And Intensity Of Ecosystem Service Values In Beijing
JO  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits that humans receive from nature. The payments for ES provide financial incentives to urban managers to conserve natural ecosystems. The spatial pattern and intensity of ES values have become leading principles of urban planning. Although most ES evaluations of urban regions are at the city scale, urban land planning is typically made at the landscape level. The applications of remote sensing data provide a great opportunity for quantifying the ES in a finer analytical unit. In this study, we investigated the spatial patterns of ES in Beijing by calculating the economic value of each ES based on the landscape type. We compared the ES intensities observed in different administrative districts and land use types, and we obtained the following results: (1) The ES values in Beijing are distributed in a spatial pattern with low value at the center and high values in the surrounding area, with the highest value in Miyun District and the lowest value in Dongcheng District. The difference in ES intensity between above two districts is 4.087 x 10(4) yuan per hectare. (2) The ES type with higher value in Beijing are hydrology regulation and climate regulation services. (3) The land use type of forest is the main source of ES values, accounting for 67.2\% of the total value. This study provides a spatial clarification of ES value in Beijing, which could supply a scientific reference to support urban optimization and resource allocation.

TI  - A State-Of-The-Art Review Highlighting Medical Overuse In Dermatology, 2017-2018: A Systematic Review
JO  - JAMA Dermatology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Importance: Emerging efforts to recognize and combat medical overuse are important solutions to mitigate patient morbidity from unnecessary health care interventions. Objectives: To identify and highlight important original investigations on medical overuse in dermatology from 2017 to 2018. Evidence Review: The PubMed and Embase databases coupled with articles published in 8 major dermatology and medical journals from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, were searched to identify articles related to medical overuse in dermatology. Findings: Of 1941 candidate articles identified through the database search and 41 through the manual journal review, 38 were deemed relevant to medical overuse in dermatology by 2 independent reviewers. Twenty-eight of these articles were determined to be high priority based on scoring for quality of methods, magnitude of clinical effect, and number of patients potentially affected. After expert reviewer scoring, 10 articles were selected for analysis based on highest scores and greatest clinical significance. Selected articles covered topics such as dermatology consultation for cellulitis, management of dysplastic nevi, prognostic utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy, laboratory monitoring for terbinafine and isotretinoin, and safe medication prescribing. For cellulitis management, dermatology consultation is important for reducing misdiagnosis, unnecessary hospitalization, and inappropriate use of antibiotics. Findings related to common dermatologic procedures revealed that clinical observation is safe for dysplastic nevi and that sentinel lymph node biopsy may not have prognostic utility over Breslow thickness. In monitoring for terbinafine and isotretinoin, patient education on clinical symptoms is likely more effective than standard laboratory test result monitoring. Finally, dermatologists should reconsider the use of cyclosporine in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis and reevaluate the use of perioperative narcotics for patients. Conclusions and Relevance: This review notes actionable, evidence-based practices to reduce medical overuse in dermatology. This work may help to facilitate management changes to emphasize high-value care in dermatology while promoting awareness and further evaluation of overuse in medicine. © 2019 American Medical Association.

TI  - Study On Spatial Spillover Effects And Influencing Factors Of Carbon Emissions In County Areas Of Ha-Chang City Group: Evidence From Npp-Viirs Nightlight Data
JO  - Huanjing Kexue Xuebao/Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae
PY  - 2020
AB  - Based on the carbon emission data, which were calculated from the 2012-2016 NPP-VIIRS nightlight data of a total of 68 county-level units in the Ha-Chang urban agglomeration, the spatial characteristics, influencing factors and dynamic spatial spillover effects of urban carbon emission were analyzed at county level with spatial autocorrelation, rank-size rule, spatial econometric model and spatial Markov-chain model. The results indicate that, firstly, city carbon emission shows a downward trend year by year. The spatial Moran's I index indicates that there is a high spatial autocorrelation of urban carbon emission in the study area, and the high value aggregation of carbon emission is decreasing. Secondly, according to rank-size rule, all the urban carbon emission in the study area shows a sub-type distribution, and high-level cities witnesses a huge amount of carbon emission. The amount of carbon emission from the top ten cities reduced initially and then increased, from decentralization to concentration. Thirdly, having compared using various spatial panel models, the factors of the development level of urban economic and population density show a significant positive correlation; only in the time fixed model, play the fixed investment and foreign investment factors a positive role; technological progress and road network density factors play a significant inhibitory role. At last, spatial Markov chain analysis results show that urban carbon emission space spillover effect is obvious, and low-level cities and high-level ones remain stable during the transfer process; if low- and medium-level cities are adjacent to those with high carbon emission, the probability of transition will be reduced; and if not, it will be promoted. © 2020, Science Press.

TI  - The Impact Of Protected Area Governance And Management Capacity On Ecosystem Function In Central America
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a prominent approach to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. A critical question for safeguarding these resources is how PA governance processes and management structures influence their effectiveness. We conduct an impact evaluation of 12 PAs in three Central American countries to assess how processes in management restrictions, management capacity, and decentralization affect the annual change in the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI varies with greenness that relates to plant production, biomass, and important ecosystem functions related to biodiversity and ecosystem services such as water quality and carbon storage. Any loss of vegetation cover in the form of deforestation or degradation would show up as a decrease in NDVI values over time and gains in vegetation cover and regeneration as an increase in NDVI values. Management restriction categories are based on international classifications of strict versus multiple-use PAs, and capacity and decentralization categories are based on key informant interviews of PA managers. We use matching to create a counterfactual of non-protected observations and a matching estimator and regression to estimate treatment effects of each sub-sample. On average, strict and multiple-use PAs have a significant and positive effect on NDVI compared to non-protected land uses. Both high and low decentralized PAs also positively affect NDVI. High capacity PAs have a positive and significant effect on NDVI, while low capacity PAs have a negative effect on NDVI. Our findings advance knowledge on how governance and management influence PA effectiveness and suggest that capacity may be more important than governance type or management restrictions in maintaining and enhancing NDVI. This paper also provides a guide for future studies to incorporate measures of PA governance and management into impact evaluations. © 2018 Muñoz Brenes et al.

TI  - Mapping Spatial Distribution Of Invasive Alien Species Through Satellite Remote Sensing In Karachi, Pakistan: An Urban Ecological Perspective
JO  - International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology
PY  - 2022
AB  - The exponential population growth of Karachi city has taken a very heavy toll on the indigenous environment of this South Asian megacity. In this context, the unlikely roadsides plantation of nonnative species by the city decision-makers was a short-term solution to cultivate green belts, ultimately, to improve city environment. However, this has backfired and become a very serious ecological crisis as the species become invasive alien species and destroyed the native ecological environment of the city significantly. This study provided an accurate spatial extent of invasive alien species and evaluated the intensity of the problem using remote sensing technology. Firstly, the importance value index was developed to highlight the intensity of invasive alien species in native plant communities. Afterwards, the hot spots were sampled to develop training areas for Object Based Image Analysis to map the extent of invasive alien species in the city using high-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery. The overall accuracy of mapping was 93.17% with Kappa coefficient value of 0.904. In addition, to explore hyperspectral remote sensing analysis, two techniques—Derivative Vegetation Index and Spectral Angle Mapper—were employed on EO-I hyperspectral imagery to map invasive alien species using spectral signatures. The analysis revealed 99.94% correlation between the two mapping techniques. Finally, to identify the impact of invasive alien species on the microclimate of the city, a spatiotemporal analysis (1992–2016) at selected sites was performed on Landsat thermal images. The study ruled out the concept of invasive alien species influence on the microclimate of the city as both vegetation growth and ambient air temperature change were not interdependent. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Today Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed with great accuracy and specificity by general practicioners. Dementia, however, is commonly diagnosed at the time of major domestic breakdown, when symptoms are severe, and family and community patience have been etoded. The terra dementia does not imply a specific cause or pathological process. More than 50 illnesses can cause dementia. Alzheimer's disease counts for the majority of cases, either alone or in combination with other illnesses, and therefore gains important medical and socioeconomical significance. The still unresolved aetiology of the neurodegenerative disorder is currently a matter of intensive clinical and basic research efforts worldwide. Neurobiological data set the conceptual basis for new promising treatment strategies. Currently, clinical therapy trials with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy regarding cognitive core symtoms in mildly to moderately demented patients. In order to encourage early referral and identification of patients, cooperation between memory clinics and specialized clinical psychogeriatric departments can provide services for patients with cognitive impairment and their caregivers, especially valuable for general practitioners, internists, psychiatrists and neurologists, offering a multidisciplinary assessment, early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, therapy and planning of an individual "care-package" for each patient. Early diagnosis enables the development of an individual plan of care, existing drug treatment can be rationalised, and appropriate treatment started at a stage when it is potentially of most value.

TI  - Giuh-Nash Based Runoff Prediction For Debarwa Catchment In Eritrea
PY  - 2019
AB  - Correct assessment of river flow is necessary to resolve a wide range of problems in the management and use of water resources. Recently, research towards the use of geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) coupled with other conceptual models approach for flood prediction from ungauged catchments has been intensified. Widespread accessibility to geographic information system and remotely sensed imagery which are powerful tools for acquiring model inputs is one possible reason. This study, therefore, aims at direct surface runoff (DSRO) prediction using the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph based Nash model (GIUH-Nash) from ungauged catchment. DEM obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) having 30 m resolution is used to generate the catchment's physiographic and geomorphologic characteristics with the help of quantum geographic information system (QGIS). Based on this information, the GIUH-Nash model is used to simulate DSRO for different storm events. A visual comparison of observed values to predicted values of the runoff hydrographs as well as statistical indices shows that DSRO could be predicted with reasonable accuracy provided complete understanding of the model development and it's evaluation procedures are properly followed. In respect of this, some key aspects that affect the performance of the model have been suggested.

TI  - Reoperative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy In Ipsilateral Breast Cancer Relapse
JO  - BREAST
PY  - 2009
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is controversial following ipsilateral breast tumour relapse (IBTR) and previous axillary surgery. We retrospectively assessed the feasibility, outcomes and utility of this procedure. Eighteen patients with IBTR who underwent reoperative SLNB were identified. Fifteen women had previously undergone axillary lymph node dissection and three SLNB for breast cancer. Twelve of 16 patients underwent successful lymphoscintigraphy (LSG). Lymphatic drainage patterns varied widely - ipsilateral axilla (5), contralateral axilla (5), and ipsilateral internal mammary (5). Two patients had drainage to more than one nodal basin. Nine of 12 patients demonstrated drainage outside of the ipsilateral axilla. Reoperative SLNB was successful in 12/18 of patients - 4 ipsilateral axilla, 1 ipsilateral internal mammary, 1 ipsilateral intramammary, 4 contralateral axilla. Two patients had sentinel nodes in multiple nodal basins. Positive sentinel node was found in one successful case (contralateral axilla) and isolated tumour cells in two (1 contralateral axilla, 1 ipsilateral internal mammary). In conclusion, reoperative SLNB is feasible. Lymphatic drainage patterns vary widely and preoperative LSG is vital to facilitate identification of sentinel nodes in unusual sites. Its prognostic and therapeutic significance warrants further study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Attitude Optimization By Extremum Seeking For Rigid Bodies Actuated By Internal Rotors Only
JO  - International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control
PY  - 2023
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the stabilizing effect of an extremum seeking control law on a class of underactuated Lagrangian control systems with symmetry. Our study is motivated by the problem of attitude optimization for satellites with reaction wheels. The goal is to minimize the value of an analytically unknown configuration-dependent objective function without being reliant on measurements of the current configuration and velocity. This work extends our previous work on extremum seeking control for fully actuated mechanical systems on Lie groups in the absence of dissipation. We show that the earlier method for fully actuated systems can also be successfully applied to a certain class of underactuated systems, which are controlled by internal momentum exchange devices (reaction wheels) so that the total momentum is conserved. Conservation of momentum allows us to reduce the control system to a system on a smaller state manifold. The reduced control system is not of Lagrangian form but fully actuated. For the reduced control system we prove that the extremum seeking method leads to practical uniform asymptotic stability. We illustrate our findings by the example of a rigid body with internal rotors. © 2023 The Authors. International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Reciprocity Of Grassland Conservation And Pastoralist Livelihoods: Evidence From Comparison Between Developed And Developing Regions
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Grasslands provide important livestock products such as beef and milk, the main source of daily nutrients for human beings. However, ecological degradation has occurred in nearly 50\% of global grasslands, which seriously restricts livestock product supply and impairs human well-beings. Sustainable management measures are explored both in developed and developing regions to curb grassland degradation trend and achieve economic -ecological coordination. We focused on the differences of grassland management measures and their economic -ecological effects between developed regions (US, New Zealand and Western Europe) and developing regions (Inner Mongolia, China) along the "global gold pastures" in middle-latitude zone, by analyzing human-induced grassland productivity changes based on satellite remote sensing, and livestock carrying pressure based on forage-livestock relationship. The results showed the human-induced GPP on grasslands were higher in those developed regions than Inner Mongolia, while the livestock carrying pressures of grasslands were lower, which indicated that the ecological effect of grassland management measures was more positive in the developed re-gions. Although strict grassland-livestock balance policies had effectively altered the degradation trends in Inner Mongolia grassland, the economic growth still strongly relies on increasing livestock quantity within the grazing limitation, while those developed regions increased the economic benefits and also reduce the ecological pres-sure caused by livestock grazing in the meantime. Artificial pastures construction together with improved pro-duction efficiency effectively mitigated the ecological pressure on grasslands and also brought more economic benefits in those developed regions, which could also enlighten other developing regions to promoting sus-tainable utilization of grasslands and development of animal husbandry.

TI  - Bridging DecisionMaking Process And Environmental Needs In Corridor Planning
JO  - Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose The aim of this paper is to clarify the spatial multicriteria workflow for stakeholders and decision makers, for which feedback rankings are vital to the success of the transportation planning. Design/methodology/approach The experimental approach was designed to integrate in a novel fashion both analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and multicriteria decision making (MCDM) within a geospatial information system (GIS) framework to deliver visual and objective tabular results useful to estimate environmental costs of the alignments generated. The method enables ranking, prioritization, selection, and refinement of preferred alternatives. The Interstate269, the newly planned bypass of MemphisTN, for which a recent environmental impact study (EIS) was completed, was selected as the experiment testbed. Findings The results indicate that the approach can automate the delivery of feasible alignments that closely approximate those generated by traditional approaches. Furthermore, via integration of local planning and ancillary spatial data, the method provided alignment results that avoided areas where local opposition was noted in the EIS. This enhanced method based on remote sensing and spatial information technologies delivers low or highpredicted environmental costs per feature criteria and cumulative predicted costs while preserving local values and plans. Practical implications The method is highly transferable and limited solely by the availability of sources of geospatial data and coordination with stakeholders. The approach was implemented to derive results similar to traditional approaches with benefits in time, costs, and quality of solutions. Originality/value A novel adaptation of MCDM and AHD within a spatial decisionmaking framework is presented. The paper suggests a clarification of multicriteria workflow to design and select leastenvironmentalcost corridors. The case study application provides a starting point to develop practical tools that delivers environmental benefits through a collaborative process capturing stakeholder values and decision maker opinions. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

TI  - Assessment Of Surface Hydrological Connectivity In An Ungauged Multi-Lake System With A Combined Approach Using Geostatistics And Spaceborne Sar Observations
JO  - WATER
PY  - 2020
AB  - Connectivity metrics for surface water are important for predicting floods and droughts, and improving water management for human use and ecological integrity at the landscape scale. The integrated use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and geostatistics approach can be useful for developing and quantifying these metrics and their changes, including geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), surface water extent (SWE), and connection frequency. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis based on 52 wet and dry binary state (i.e., water and non-water) rasters derived from Sentinel-1 A/B GRD products acquired from 2015 to 2019 for China's Momoge National Nature Reserve to investigate applicability and dynamics of the hydrologic connectivity metrics in an ungauged (i.e., data such as flow and water level are scarce) multi-lake system. We found: (1) generally, the change of GCF in North-South and Northeast-Southwest directions was greater than that in the West-East and Northwest-Southeast directions; (2) MDC had a threshold effect, generally at most 25 km along the W-E, NW-SE and NE-SW directions, and at most 45 km along the N-S direction; (3) the flow paths between lakes are diverse, including channelized flow, diffusive overbank flow, over-road flow and "fill-and-merge"; (4) generally, the values of the three surface hydrological connectivity indicators (i.e., the MDC, the SWE, and the conneciton frequency) all increased from May to August, and decreased from August to October; (5) generally, the closer the distance between the lakes, the greater the connection frequency, but it is also affected by the dam and road barrier. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the geostatistical method combining Sentinel-1 SAR image analysis in quantifying surface hydrological connectivity in an ungagged area. This approach should be applicable for other geographical regions, in order help resource managers and policymakers identify changes in surface hydrological connectivity, as well as address potential impacts of these changes on water resources for human use and/or ecological integrity at the landscape level.

TI  - Address Of Early Stage Primary Colonic Neoplasia By N.o.t.e.s
JO  - Surgical Oncology
PY  - 2009
AB  - Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (N.O.T.E.S.) has the capacity to impact greatly on the practice of colorectal surgery. As much as potentially providing an alternative means of operative approach, its consideration and evolution is already also providing a wealth of instrument innovation that seems likely to greatly enhance the endoscopists' armamentarium for advanced endoluminal intervention. Furthermore, its aspirational concept is greatly advancing the progress of single site incision laparoscopic approaches and is speeding appreciation of translumenal assistance and operation. However, if N.O.T.E.S. is to occupy a distinct role in the surgical management of colorectal disease, it needs a niche indication of its own that constitutes a therapeutic advance with considerable clinical benefit for suitable patients. Conversely, sound development of a specific stream-lined operative strategy for N.O.T.E.S-type operations may exert a reciprocal swash upon conventional specialist practice. Thus spurred by N.O.T.E.S, localized resection may become standard therapy for early stage colonic neoplasia regardless of operative access although considerable clinical study is as yet required. Therefore, as much as ensuring feasibility and accuracy in the replication of conventional surgical maneuvers, the dawn of N.O.T.E.S. should be recognized as an opportunity for the inquisition of prevailing surgical principles and prejudices in order that colorectal operations are further honed towards perfection (above all it should be realized that avoidance of abdominal scarring is not the last barrier before surgical nirvana). This may represent the main legacy of transluminal investigation whether or not pure N.O.T.E.S. operating ever becomes a clinical reality in its own right. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation Of Timber Volume In A Coniferous Plantation Forest Using Landsat Tm
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 1997
AB  - Optimisation of economic return from forests requires that comprehensive forest inventory data be available to support the design of harvesting strategies. Such inventory data can potentially be obtained by remote sensing. This study investigates the accuracy with which wood volume (m3 ha -1) in a plantation forest can be calculated from Landsat TM data at the pixel and foreststand spatial scales. Wood volumes were estimated from regression analysis, nonparametric line-fitting, and an N-dimensional K-nearest-neighbour classification scheme. At the pixel scale, relations between Landsat data and measured wood volume were found to be significant but weak, with r2 values of 0.3, and with correspondingly poor estimates of wood volume (root-mean-square errors rmses of 100 m3 ha -1). By averaging the pixel-scale estimates, wood volume estimates of acceptable accuracy were obtained for forest-stand areas of about 40 ha (rmses of 46 m3 ha -1). Parametric regression performed slightly better overall than non-parametric line fitting techniques for estimating wood volume. Estimates of similar accuracy to those obtained by regression were also given by NK-classification at the pixel-scale, provided K was large (15), although the classifier produced biased results at the forest-stand scale. It is concluded that Landsat TM only provides an acceptable data source for estimating wood volumes in plantation forests for areas of about 40 ha and larger. The very low dynamic range in the Landsat data is probably a significant factor limiting its use for inventory at more detailed scales. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Operational Trials Of Remote Mosquito Trap Systems For Japanese Encephalitis Virus Surveillance In The Torres Strait, Australia
JO  - Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases
PY  - 2007
AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) appears nearly annually in the Torres Strait in far northern Queensland, Australia, and is a threat to invade the Australian mainland. Surveillance has involved the use of sentinel pigs that develop detectable viremias and antibody titers to JEV. However, pigs are amplifying hosts for JEV, and thus pose a health risk to the public and to pig handlers who bleed the pigs. A remote mosquito trap system would not have these risks. We report on trials using a remote mosquito trap system for the surveillance of JEV in the Torres Strait. The Mosquito Magnet (MM) Pro®, MM Liberty Plus®, and a novel updraft trap, the NAQS Mozzie Trap, were run at Badu and Moa islands in the Torres Strait and at Bamaga in the northern Cape York Peninsula from 2002-2005. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect JEV nucleic acid in weekly mosquito collections. Sentinel pigs located at Badu were also bled and the serum processed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR for JEV antigen and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-JEV antibodies. JEV was detected in mosquito collections each year but not in each trap. No JEV was detected in trapped mosquitoes before detection in sentinel pigs. The mosquito trap system cost ca. AU$10,000 per site, about AU$5,000 less than a pig-based system. However, trap failures caused by mosquito-clogged motors, electrical faults, and blocked gas lines reduced the efficacy of some mosquito traps. Nonetheless, a remote mosquito trap system, employing stand alone traps and PCR for viral antigen detection, can be a safe, economical way to detect arbovirus activity in remote areas. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Airsense-To-Act: A Concept Paper For Covid-19 Countermeasures Based On Artificial Intelligence Algorithms And Multi-Source Data Processing
JO  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
PY  - 2021
AB  - The aim of this concept paper is the description of a new tool to support institutions in the implementation of targeted countermeasures, based on quantitative and multi-scale elements, for the fight and prevention of emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is a cloud-based centralized system; a multi-user platform that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the processing of heterogeneous data, which can produce as an output the level of risk. The model includes a specific neural network which is first trained to learn the correlations between selected inputs, related to the case of interest: environmental variables (chemical-physical, such as meteorological), human activity (such as traffic and crowding), level of pollution (in particular the concentration of particulate matter) and epidemiological variables related to the evolution of the contagion. The tool realized in the first phase of the project will serve later both as a decision support system (DSS) with predictive capacity, when fed by the actual measured data, and as a simulation bench performing the tuning of certain input values, to identify which of them led to a decrease in the degree of risk. In this way, we aimed to design different scenarios to compare different restrictive strategies and the actual expected benefits, to adopt measures sized to the actual needs, adapted to the specific areas of analysis and useful for safeguarding human health; and we compared the economic and social impacts of the choices. Although ours is a concept paper, some preliminary analyses have been shown, and two different case studies are presented, whose results have highlighted a correlation between NO2, mobility and COVID-19 data. However, given the complexity of the virus diffusion mechanism, linked to air pollutants but also to many other factors, these preliminary studies confirmed the need, on the one hand, to carry out more in-depth analyses, and on the other, to use AI algorithms to capture the hidden relationships among the huge amounts of data to process.

TI  - Remote Sensing And Hydrological Measurements For Irrigation Performance Assessments In A Water User Association In The Lower Amu Darya River Basin
JO  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2011
AB  - Irrigation water management in Central Asia is notorious for its inefficiency. We assessed the operational performance of the irrigation scheme in one Water Users Association (WUA), Shomakhulum, in Khorezm district, Uzbekistan, in 2007 to provide recommendations for strategic water management planning. Relative evapotranspiration (RET), delivery performance ratio (DPR), drainage ratio (DR), depleted fraction (DF), overall consumed ratio (OCR), field application ratio (FAR) and conveyance ratio (CR) were used as performance indicators. The components of the water balance were obtained through remote sensing techniques and hydrological field measurements. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) was applied to MODIS satellite data to derive actual and potential evapotranspiration. Inflows and outflows were quantified with field measurements in the irrigation and drainage network using discharge rating curves. Ponding experiments allowed determining canal seepage losses. Water balances at field level were established for application efficiency estimations. The indicator values were then compared to efficiency target values taken from the literature in order to assess the operational capabilities of the irrigation scheme. The general performance of the irrigation scheme is very poor. DPRs exceeding 1.0 indicate that more water is delivered to the system than is demanded. The seasonal DF of 0.4 is lower than the target value of 0.6. Losses during the field application averaged at 57\%, which is 24\% above target values. Seasonal DR, OCR, CR and RET are 0.55, 0.51, 0.76 and 0.82 against the target values of 0.1, 0.54, 0.84 and 0.75, respectively. We conclude that the distribution mechanism can be considerably improved. Besides improving water distribution (timing and equity) in the network, another recommended intervention would be to increase the DF, particularly by interventions at field level that raise the FAR, which in turn will improve DR and OCR. This can be achieved by introducing modern water management approaches such as laser leveling, double-sided irrigation, and control of inflow through flow-measuring devices installed at farm gates, and adequate water pricing.

TI  - An Innovative Approach To Surface Deformation Estimation In Forest Road And Trail Networks Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Real-Time Kinematic-Derived Data For Monitoring And Maintenance
JO  - Forests
PY  - 2024
AB  - The significant increase in hiking, wood extraction, and transportation activities exerts a notable impact on the environmental balance along trails and forest roads in the form of soil degradation. The aim of this study was to develop a Deformation Classification Model for the surface of a multi-use trail, as well as to calculate sediment deposition and generate a flood hazard map in a partially forested region. The eBee X mapping Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with the senseFly S.O.D.A. 3D camera and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) technology flew over the study area of 149 ha in Northern Greece at an altitude of 120 m and achieved a high spatial resolution of 2.6 cm. The specific constellation of fixed-wing equipment makes the use of ground control points obsolete, compared to previous, in most cases polycopter-based, terrain deformation research. Employing the same methodology, two distinct classifications were applied, utilizing the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for analysis. The Geolocation Errors and Statistics for Bundle Block Adjustment exhibited a high level of accuracy in the model, with the mean values for each of the three directions (X, Y, Z) being 0.000023 m, −0.000044 m, and 0.000177 m, respectively. The standard deviation of the error in each direction was 0.022535 m, 0.019567 m, and 0.020261 m, respectively. In addition, the Root Mean Square (RMS) error was estimated to be 0.022535 m, 0.019567 m, and 0.020262 m, respectively. A total of 20 and 30 altitude categories were defined at a 4 cm spatial resolution, each assigned specific ranges of values, respectively. The area of each altitude category was quantified in square meters (m2), while the volume of each category was measured in cubic meters (m3). The development of a Deformation Classification Model for the deck of a trail or forest road, coupled with the computation of earthworks and the generation of a flood hazards map, represents an efficient approach that can provide valuable support to forest managers during the planning phase or maintenance activities of hiking trails and forest roads. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Rainfall-Surface Runoff Estimation For The Lower Bhavani Basin In South India Using Scs-Cn Model And Geospatial Techniques
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rainfall and surface runoff are the two most important components, which control the groundwater recharge of the basin. The long-term groundwater recharge of an aquifer gets affected by the population growth, irregular agriculture activities and industrialization. Hence, estimation of rainfall-surface runoff is very much essential for proper groundwater management practices. In the present study, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model was employed in combination with geospatial techniques to estimate rainfall-surface runoff for the Lower Bhavani River basin in South India. To develop the SCS-CN model, rainfall data were obtained for 33 years (1983-2015) from 22 rain gauge stations spread over the basin. IRS LISS-IV satellite data of 5.8 m spatial resolution were used to analyze the land use/land cover (LU/LC) behavior. Based on the soil properties, four Hydrological Soil Groups (HSG) were identified in the basin which is most significant for surface runoff estimation. Curve Number (CN) values were obtained for various Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) such as dry condition (AMC I), average condition (AMC II) and wet condition (AMC III). Spatial distribution of CN values was plotted using Geographical Information System (GIS) for the entire Lower Bhavani Basin to assess the surface runoff potential. The results indicate that the annual rainfall varies from 267 mm (2002) to 1528.6 mm (2005), and the annual surface runoff varies from 102.04 mm (1985) to 463.02 mm (2010). The SCS-CN model outputs predict that the average surface runoff of the basin is 211.99 mm, and the average surface runoff volume is 81,995,380 m(3). The study also indicates that nearly 53\% of the basin area is dominated by high to very high surface runoff potential. Finally, the output of surface runoff potential was validated with the Average Groundwater Level Fluctuation (AGLF) observed in 57 wells spread over the entire basin. The basin AGLF ranges from 2.32 to 21.72 m. The surface runoff potential categories are satisfactorily matching with the AGLF categories. Moderate surface runoff as well as moderate AGLF zones mostly occupy the central portion of the basin, which possess good groundwater potential. However, the high surface runoff zones in the basin lead more surface water flow into the river channels, which reduce the infiltration rate and decline the water table. This problem can be solved by constructing suitable artificial groundwater recharge structures across the river channels in the high surface runoff potential areas.

TI  - Towards Risk-Based Flood Management In Highly Productive Paddy Rice Cultivation - Concept Development And Application To The Mekong Delta
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
PY  - 2018
AB  - Flooding is an imminent natural hazard threatening most river deltas, e.g. the Mekong Delta. An appropriate flood management is thus required for a sustainable development of the often densely populated regions. Recently, the traditional event-based hazard control shifted towards a risk management approach in many regions, driven by intensive research leading to new legal regulation on flood management. However, a large-scale flood risk assessment does not exist for the Mekong Delta. Particularly, flood risk to paddy rice cultivation, the most important economic activity in the delta, has not been performed yet. Therefore, the present study was developed to provide the very first insight into delta-scale flood damages and risks to rice cultivation. The flood hazard was quantified by probabilistic flood hazard maps of the whole delta using a bivariate extreme value statistics, synthetic flood hydrographs, and a large-scale hydraulic model. The flood risk to paddy rice was then quantified considering cropping calendars, rice phenology, and harvest times based on a time series of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MODIS satellite data, and a published rice flood damage function. The proposed concept provided flood risk maps to paddy rice for the Mekong Delta in terms of expected annual damage. The presented concept can be used as a blueprint for regions facing similar problems due to its generic approach. Furthermore, the changes in flood risk to paddy rice caused by changes in land use currently under discussion in the Mekong Delta were estimated. Two land-use scenarios either intensifying or reducing rice cropping were considered, and the changes in risk were presented in spatially explicit flood risk maps. The basic risk maps could serve as guidance for the authorities to develop spatially explicit flood management and mitigation plans for the delta. The land-use change risk maps could further be used for adaptive risk management plans and as a basis for a cost-benefit of the discussed land-use change scenarios. Additionally, the damage and risks maps may support the recently initiated agricultural insurance programme in Vietnam.

As a side effect of the approach has been that a set of consolidated tools were no longer able to fit the needs. Mission management and control SW, that had been based on big and costly SW and HW infrastructures, needed to be deeply changed. Many new, small solutions were implemented from scratch on very specific requirements case by case. But custom implementations are no more an efficient approach. The need for tools supporting NewSpace mission operators is widely shared and justifies a market for commercial solutions. The ermes SW suite was borne from Planetek's practical experience inside the ground segments: starting on ground support equipment and scientific mission, ermes is now able to provide a set of tools (along with a full development framework) intended to satellite integrators and operators. Ermes has been designed preserving the compatibility with traditional ground segments (based on SCOS2000 mission information base and CCSDS protocols, as PUS, TMTC and SLE) and provides all the standards functionalities and interfaces, implementing a lightweight approach, integrating reliability with scalability and adopting a state-of-art technological stack. The system can be deployed in a cloud-based environment and its functionalities and graphical user interfaces are available both on a native SW client and via a web interface. Ermes fits to support routine tasks in the ground segment's operational phase. It supports procedures (and telecommands) preparation and execution, provides systems monitoring capabilities, custom panels highlighting real time TM reception, parameters change and alarms. The on-going integration with an automated smart telemetry checking module (CASTeC by SATE and Planetek) adds predictive capabilities learning from reference telemetries and evaluating system status, highlighting critical values, trends and un-expected behaviors, for mission operators support. Ermes is a tool fitting to needs of different user's roles and different phases in the frame of small (to large) space missions and allows for costs optimization in design and operations. It is now adopted for the Solar Wind Analyser instruments suite (onboard Solar Orbiter) monitoring, in the Space Data Gateway project, in STRIVING IOD/IOV mission ground segment and will be also part of the ground segment of PLATiNO 1 and PLATiNO 2 missions from the Italian Space Agency.

TI  - Rapid Detection Of Land Cover Change In Tropical Savanna Environment Using Conditional Change Vector Analysis On Remote Sensing Data In Moyo Watershed, Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia
JO  - Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management
PY  - 2021
AB  - In environmental management, land cover change is a crucial aspect. The area of tropical savanna environments is vulnerable to land degradation. This study aimed to rapidly detect land cover changes in a tropical savanna environment based on remote sensing data. Conditional change detection was performed using the Change Vector Analysis (CVA) with input parameters such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI). The results showed that during the period 2015 to 2019, changes were detected in the Moyo watershed every year. From 2015 to 2016, the Moyo River Basin was dominated by changes with a change magnitude of less than 0.088, which was 63% of the Moyo River Basin area. From 2016 to 2017, the changes were dominated by the change magnitude value of 0.063, which was 58.6% of the Moyo River Basin area. From 2017 to 2018, changes were dominated by the change magnitude value of 0.084 of 55.26% of the Moyo watershed area. From 2018 to 2019, the change was dominated by the change magnitude value of 0.057, which was 47.57% of the Moyo watershed area. The direction of land cover change was dominated by Q2 in 2016, Q4 in 2017 and 2018, and Q2 and Q4 in 2019. These changes generally occurred in the Moyo watershed middle and downstream parts, which are grasslands. The use of the Conditional Change Vector Analysis (CCVA) approach in a tropical savanna environment can detect changes and the direction of change with an accuracy of about 70%. © 2021 Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management.

TI  - A Knowledge-Based Approach To Urban Growth Modeling In Gorgan City Using Logistic Regression
JO  - Journal of Environmental Studies
PY  - 2010
AB  - Environment has a general sense and the term "urban and urbanism" brings a narrow image of environment to minds. Development of cities and population growth is normally associated with an increase in the environmental pollutions created by human activities which in turn affects land use and land cover of the area under urban growth. Changes in land use are results of complex interaction of many factors including policy management economics culture and human behavior Modeling is widely used by decision-makers for controlling land use changes and their trends. It is a suitable tool for exploring the interactions within the land use dynamics and the driving factors of change. Through linking data and theory using formal equations models help to improve our understanding of the underlying processes of land use change. A land use model typically consists of three components: multi-temporal land use maps derived from remotely sensed data a multivariate function of the hypothesized determinants of change and the resulting prediction map of land use change. Land use models serve three main purposes. Firstly they help to identify the set of variables that are most important in explaining land use change. Secondly they reveal the relative importance of the significant variables. The magnitude of the effect of factors on land change is important because it may indicate areas where policy intervention is most urgently needed and whether local action to mitigate adverse effect of land change will be sustainable. Lastly land use models may be useful in predicting the location of land use change in the immediate future. The ability to locate vulnerable places to land use change helps to mitigate their adverse effects. Theobald and Hobbs (1998) described two basic types of spatially explicit land use change models: regression-type models and spatial transition-based models. However rule-based simulation models such as Cellular Automata (CA) are most suitable for incorporating spatial interaction effects and handling temporal dynamics but most dynamic simulation models cannot incorporate enough socioeconomic variables. Logistic regression (LR) is a special case of multiple regression in which the dependent variable is discrete. The difference between the multiple linear and logistic regression is that logistic regression is applicable when the dependent variable is discrete and probability of taking positive values (e.g. pi) is a logistic curve of independent variables. If dependent variable is dichotomous Y takes on only two values: 1 and 0 where Y=1 confirms the event is occurred and Y=0 shows the event isn't occurred. The logistic regression equation can be expressed as follows: logit(p)=ln(p/(1-p))=a+ {b1X1} +{b2X 2}+ {b3X3)+ ...{bnXn} where p is the probability of the dependent variable Y being 1 given (X 1 X2 ... Xn) i.e. the probability of a cell being urbanized X1 X2 and X3 are the independent variables; a is the intercept; and bi b2 and b 3 are the coefficients of the independent variables X1 X2 and X3 respectively. The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables follows a logistic curve. The logic transformation of the equation effectively linearizes the model so that the dependent variable of the regression is continuous in the range 0-1. In linear regression the method used most often for estimating unknown parameters is least squares but in logistic regression the method used is maximum likelihood. The nature of the land use/cover change of a cell is dichotomous that presents land use change and land use no-change. If binary values 1 and 0 are used to represent urban growth and no urban growth respectively and if it is assumed that the probability of a cell changing to urban use follows the logistic curve as described by the logistic function: f(z)=1/1 + e-z Then the probability of a cell being urbanized can be estimated with the following logistic regression model: P(Y) =1/ X1 X2 .. XK) = 1/1+e -(α+Σk=1β1×1) Three groups of variables including economic-social (based on expert information: distance to economic centers distance to administrative centers distance to sport-recreation centers distance to medical centers and distance to education centers) and biophysical (based on SLEUTH model: Slope Land use Exclusion Urban extent Transportation Hillshade) plus land use were used. To provide excluded layer past urban areas road network and land use for the study area we used Landsat TM and ETM+ images dated 16 July 1987 and 30 July 2001. We applied a supervised classification approach for discerning different land use and land cover types in the area. The change in the urban area was detected using a post-classification comparison. We also identified changes in the forested areas agricultural lands bare lands pastures and thin forests and then converted these layers into a Boolean map containing 1 and 0. Using the informationbased approach we also prepared layers for economic-social variables as independent layers. Biophysical variables were provided based on the input of the SLEUTH modeling method to make the comparison between modeling approaches possible. The slope layer was derived from a digital elevation map interpolated from 1:25000 contour map of the area. Covariation among the independent variables is possible. If linear relationship between variables is observed thus multi-collinearity exists. Principal Component Analysis with the option of computing covariance between variables was used in Idrisi to survey the likely relationships. Covariance of two variables was shown to be greater than 0.9. Covariance range is 0-1 and when this value is closer to 1 then the relation of the two variables in explaining variance is deemed to be higher. As a result distance to administrative and sporting centers plus distance to cities were deleted from the group of independent variables. After collating independent variables the data were fed into the logistic regression in Idrisi software. To assess the results the predicted urban change layer was compared to that of the real one in 2001. The relative operating characteristics (ROC) curve is a useful method of representing the quality of deterministic and probabilistic detection of forecast systems. ROC predicts the occurrence of an event by comparing a probability image depicting the probability of that event occurring and a binary image showing where that class actually exists. When there is a perfect match between reality map and the modeled one the ROC takes a value of 1. In the case where there is no spatial agreement between those maps the ROC value becomes 0.5. ROC value for LR model was 0.87; hence the success of modeling with LR was confirmed. Beside McFadden's pseudo R-square was used to test the goodness-of-fit of the model. Pseudo R square values between 0.2 and 0.4 are considered a good fit. Logistic regression does not have an equivalent to the R-square that is found in ordinary least square (OLS) regression. Although some come up with pseudo Rsquare statistics this statistic does not mean what R-square means in OLS regression. The pseudo R2 value of the full model is 0.2107 indicating a good fit. The result of fitting the logistic regression model with the full 10 independent variables is given below: Logit (87-2001) = -4.9629 - (0.00033xF) + (0.96794x1) + (0.00006xD) - (1.66448xL) + (1.92012xK) + (1.59072×J) - (0.00020×B) + (0.00793×A) - (0.000099×H) + (0.56282×M) One of the outputs of urban growth models is an image map of urban growth probability predicted for future which can be used to create new urban location maps for future. Based on the probability map we can answer the question: "where would urban growth occur if we knew growth size?" New urban location is selected from the cells with the highest likelihood of land use change and thus predicted urban location for LR model in 2010 202 2030 and 2040 was created. The relative effect of the 10 predictor variables were evaluated through ROC method using 10 reducedvariable models and the full model. After models were run with complete data models were again run 10 more times. At each run one ariable was removed and the model was run to see the effect of the reduced variable. Through this application it was possible to assess the sensitivity of the models and to discover the relative effect of the variables. The results show that land use type in the study area has the highest effect on urban growth in the logistic regression method. Cultivated and pasture land uses have also high effect on the predicted urban growth map. This study has shown that a logistic regression model has strengths relative to a CA model in that the logistic regression model not only can include such biophysical variables as SLEUTH (slope land use exclusion urban extent transportation hillshade) in the CA model but it is a better approach for incorporation of human drivers. The model's ability to include more demographic and econometric variables allows us to better understand human forces in shaping urban patterns. Although the logistic regression model can incorporate demographic data it suffers from some limitations such as personal or household preferences for locations urban or regional development policies and globalization of economy. Unlike the CA models the logistic regression model is not temporally explicit.

TI  - Spatial Modeling Of Landscape Values: Discovering The Boundaries Of Conflicts And Identifying Mutual Benefits As A Basis For Land Management
JO  - Society and Natural Resources
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conflicting interests amongst different stakeholder groups regarding land use challenge the protection of natural values in socio-ecological systems (SES). In this paper we show, based on a case study of Israel’s Makhteshim Country National Park, how mapping the different interests and analyzing the data with a GIS system allows us to locate significant conflict points between groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 individuals from three major stakeholder groups in the region: semi-nomadic Bedouins, nature reserve rangers, and tourist operators. The qualitative findings were then mapped by a GIS platform. The mapping indicated that the stakeholder groups’ land-use is distributed in a manner that makes conflict unavoidable, but relatively limited to only certain specific areas. Moreover, in some areas, the three groups share similar or complementary values, reaping mutual benefits from shared use. We conclude that GIS mapping can serve as a powerful tool for conflict management in complex SES. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Space Science & Technology In The Arctic: Promises Of Cooperation And Development Amid New Security Challenges
JO  - IFAC-PapersOnLine
PY  - 2021
AB  - Space science and technology (S&T) holds great potential for international scientific cooperation in the Arctic, especially concerning climate change. Space-based earth observation, navigation/positioning and communication is of great value to Arctic local and indigenous communities. Space-based S&T is also a prerequisite for development of Arctic shipping and natural resources. At the same time, space S&T in the Arctic holds dynamics, which may undermine Arctic and international stability and security. The Arctic houses key infrastructure for nuclear strategic stability, weapon systems, early warning, and ballistic missile defense. Arctic high latitudes provide significant advantages to space S&T with the potential for dual use. Space, which now underpins all societies, may become militarized. Strategic stability safeguards humanity. During the Cold War, there was an effective decision-making process mediated by game theory and modelling. However, new technologies, a far more complex multiplayer, multi-nation environment and new space S&T reduce the effectiveness of traditional approaches. This research proposes to address the current intellectual vacuum by creating a clearer understanding of the parameters, players, technologies, and their interactions and develop a new and robust theoretical basis that will contribute in the longer term towards appropriate and balanced Arctic governance for achieving strategic stability and space security. This research will test the hypothesis that Arctic space S&T destabilizes strategic stability and space security. New theory, empirical overview, and modelling will provide a new intellectual basis for governance of Arctic space S&T for strategic stability and space security in the new era. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Obstacles To Implementing Evidence-Based Practice In Belgium: A Context-Specific Qualitative Evidence Synthesis Including Findings From Different Health Care Disciplines
JO  - Acta clinica Belgica
PY  - 2012
AB  - A number of barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice have already been inventoried. However, little attention has been given to their context-specific nature. This qualitative evidence synthesis examines commonalities in the obstacles perceived by different groups of health care practitioners working in the Belgian health care system and sets out to discuss potential strategies to bridge some of these barriers. We actively searched for primary studies addressing our topic of interest in international and national databases (1990 to May 2008), consulted experts and screened references of retrieved studies. We opted for the meta-aggregative approach, developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute, to analyse our findings. The findings indicate that (1) evidence might have a limited role in decision-making processes; (2) aspects other than quality of care steer the evidence-based practice agenda; (3) some health care providers benefit less from evidence-based practice than others and (4) there is a lack of competences to put the evidence-based principles in practice. Belgian policy makers might consider health care system characteristics from and strategies developed or suggested by others to respond to country-specific obstacles. Examples include but are not limited to; (a) providing incentives for patient-centred care coordination and patient communication, (b) supporting practitioners interested in applying research-related activities, (c) considering direct access systems and interprofessional learning to respond to the demand for autonomous decision-making from satellite professional groups, (d) systematically involving allied health professionals in important governmental advisory boards, (e) considering pharmaceutical companies perceived as 'the enemy' an ally in filling in research gaps, (f) embedding the evaluation of evidence-based knowledge and skills in examinations (g) moving from (in)formative learning to transformative learning and (h) organizing high quality catch-up programs for those who missed out on evidence-based medicine in their curriculum.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Distribution Of Urban Heat Islands
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - The formation of an urban heat island (UHI) is one of the most common impacts of the urbanization process. To mitigate the effects of UHI, the planning of urban forests (e.g., creation of parks, forests and afforestation streets) has been the major tool applied in this context. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of heat islands in Vila Velha, ES, Brazil using the mono-window algorithm. The study followed these methodological steps: 1) mapping of urban green areas through a photointerpretation screen; 2) application of the mono-window algorithm to obtain the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST); 3) correlation between LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference build-up index (NDBI); 4) application of ecological evaluation index. The results showed that the mean values of LST in urban areas were at least 2.34 to 7.19 °C higher than undeveloped areas. Moreover, the positive correlation between LST and NDBI showed an amplifying effect of the developed areas for UHI, while areas with a predominance of vegetation attenuated the effect of UHI. Urban centers, clustered in some parts of the city, received the worst ecological assessment index. Finally, the adoption of measures to guide the urban forest planning within urban centers is necessary to mitigate the effect of heat islands and provide thermal comfort in urban areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote Sensing And Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis For Tsunami Vulnerability Assessment
JO  - Disaster Prevention and Management: An International Journal
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the vulnerability of the Kesennuma area in Japan to a tsunami disaster and to map the area of inundation. Design/methodology/approach: Digital elevation model (DEM) data and ALOS image were used to create maps of the parameters of this study area: elevation, slope, coastal proximity, river, and land use. An analytical hierarchy process was used to assign weights to each parameter and a spatial multi-criteria analysis was applied through cell-based modelling for vulnerability mapping. Findings: The vulnerability map shows that 17.679 km2 of the area could be inundated by a tsunami. High vulnerability areas were mostly found in coastal areas with a sloping coast and a cape area. A low elevation and the presence of rivers or water channels are factors that increase the impact of tsunamis. Inundation areas were predicted to spread in areas identified as having either high vulnerability or slightly high vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: Because of the limited geospatial data, the authors encourage further studies using DEM data with a high spatial resolution. Practical implications: The results of this research can be used as basic information for disaster mitigation and urban planning in coastal areas. Originality/value: This research creates a new approach for assessing which areas could be inundated by tsunamis, based on the vulnerability map generated through remote sensing and spatial multi-criteria analysis. Moreover, the parameters used are very close to those of actual inundation maps. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Prediction Of Future Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using A Coupled Ca-Ann Model In The Upper Omo–Gibe River Basin, Ethiopia
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Land use/land cover change evaluation and prediction using spatiotemporal data are crucial for environmental monitoring and better planning and management of land use. The main objective of this study is to evaluate land use/land cover changes for the time period of 1991–2022 and predict future changes using the CA-ANN model in the Upper Omo–Gibe River basin. Landsat-5 TM for 1991, 1997, and 2004, Landsat-7 ETM+ for 2010, and Landsat-8 (OLI) for 2016 and 2022 were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer Data Center. A random forest machine learning algorithm was employed for LULC classification. The LULC classification result was evaluated using an accuracy assessment technique to assure the correctness of the classification method employing the kappa coefficient. Kappa coefficient values of the classification indicate that there was strong agreement between the classified and reference data. Using the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS and the CA-ANN model, future LULC changes were predicted. Artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular automata (CA) machine learning methods were made available for LULC change modeling and prediction via the QGIS MOLUSCE plugin. Transition potential modeling was computed, and future LULC changes were predicted using the CA-ANN model. An overall accuracy of 86.53% and an overall kappa value of 0.82 were obtained by comparing the actual data of 2022 with the simulated LULC data from the same year. The study findings revealed that between 2022 and 2037, agricultural land (63.09%) and shrubland (5.74%) showed significant increases, and forest (−48.10%) and grassland (−0.31%) decreased. From 2037 to 2052, the built-up area (2.99%) showed a significant increase, and forest and agricultural land (−2.55%) showed a significant decrease. From 2052 to 2067, the projected LULC simulation result showed that agricultural land (3.15%) and built-up area (0.32%) increased, and forest (−1.59%) and shrubland (−0.56%) showed significant decreases. According to the study’s findings, the main drivers of LULC changes are the expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land, which calls for a thorough investigation using additional data and models to give planners and policymakers clear information on LULC changes and their environmental effects. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Spectral Index-Based Monitoring (2000-2017) In Lowland Forests To Evaluate The Effects Of Climate Change
JO  - GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the next decades, climate change will put forests in the Hungarian Great Plain in the Carpathian Basin to the test, e.g., changing seasonal patterns, more intense storms, longer dry periods, and pests are expected to occur. To aid in the decision-making process for the conservation of ecosystems depending on forestry, how woods could adapt to changing meso- and microclimatic conditions in the near future needs to be defined. In addition to trendlike warming processes, calculations show an increase in climate extremes, which need to be monitored in accordance with spatial planning, at least for medium-scale mappings. We can use the MODIS sensor dataset if up-to-date terrestrial conditions and multi-decadal geographical processes are of interest. For geographic evaluations of changes, we used vegetation spectral indices; Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the summer half year, 16-day MODIS data composites between 2000 and 2017 in an intensively forested study area in the Hungarian Great Plain. We delineated forest areas on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve using Corine Land Cover maps (2000, 2006, and 2012). Mid-year changes over the nearly two-decade-long period are currently in balance; however, based on their reactions, forests are highly sensitive to abrupt changes caused by extreme climatic events. The higher occurrence of years or periods with extreme water shortages marks an observable decrease in biomass production, even in shorter index time series, such as that between 2004 and 2012. In the drought-stricken July-August periods, the effect of a dry year, subsequent to years with more precipitation, immediately pushes back the green mass and the reduction in the biomass production could become persistent, according to climatology predictions. The changes of specific sub-periods in the vegetation period can be evaluated even in a relatively short, 18-year data series, including the change in the growing values of the vegetative growth in spring or the increase in the summertime biomass production. Standardized differences highlight spatial differences in the biomass production; in response to years with the highest (negative) biomass difference; typically, the northern and southwestern parts of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve in the study area have longer lasting losses in biomass production. A comparison of NDVI and EVI values with the PaDI drought index and the vegetation indices of LANDSAT Operational Land Imager sensor respectively confirms our results.

TI  - Testing The Mhm-Mpr Reliability For Parameter Transferability Across Locations In North–Central Nigeria
JO  - Hydrology
PY  - 2022
AB  - Hydrologic modeling in Nigeria is plagued by non-existent or paucity of hydro-metrological/morphological records, which has detrimental impacts on sustainable water resource management and agricultural production. Nowadays, freely accessible remotely sensed products are used as inputs in hydrologic modeling, especially in regions with deficient observed records. Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize the fine-resolution spatial coverage offered by these products in a parameter regionalization method that supports sub-grid variability. This study assessed the transferability of optimized model parameters from a gauged to an ungauged basin using the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM)—Multiscale Parameter Regionalization (MPR) technique. The ability of the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis product (ERA5), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) gridded rainfall products to simulate observed discharge in three basins was first assessed. Thereafter, the CHIRPS rainfall product was used in three multi-basin mHM setups. Optimized model parameters were then transferred to independent basins, and the reproduction of observed discharges was assessed. Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) scores showed improvements when mHM runs were performed using optimized parameters in comparison to using default parameters for discharge simulations. Optimized mHM runs performed reasonably (KGE > 0.4) for all basins and rainfall products. However, only one basin showed a satisfactory KGE value (KGE = 0.54) when optimized parameters were transferred to an ungauged basin. This study underscores the utility of the mHM-MPR tool for parameter transferability during discharge simulation in data-scarce regions. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Monitoring The Effects Of Open-Pit Mining On The Eco-Environment Using A Moving Window-Based Remote Sensing Ecological Index
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2020
AB  - Environmental problems caused by mines have been increasing. As one of the most serious types of mining damage caused to the eco-environment, open pits have been the focus of monitoring and management. Previous studies have obtained effective results when evaluating the ecological quality of a mining area by using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). However, the calculation of RSEI does not consider that the ecological environmental impact is limited under natural conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved RSEI based on a moving window model, namely the moving window-based remote sensing ecological index (MW-RSEI). This improved index is more in agreement with the First Law of Geography than RSEI. This study uses Landsat ETM/OLI/TIRS images to extract MW-RSEI information of a case area in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, central China, in 2009 and 2018. The results revealed that the average value of MW-RSEI declined from 0.668 to 0.611 from 2009 to 2018, and the main drivers of the deterioration of the eco-environment were land use/cover (LUCC) changes, most of which were derived from urban expansion and mining. The serious impact of open pits on the eco-environment in mining areas is mainly due to their low vegetation cover; therefore, some effectively managed open pits can have a positive impact on the mining environment. The use of MW-RSEI provides valuable information on the eco-environment surrounding the open pit, which can be used for the rapid and effective monitoring of the eco-environment in mining areas.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Value Change Analysis Of Chishui River Basin Based On Land Use Change
JO  - Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology
PY  - 2023
AB  - Based on the remote sensing interpreted land use data of Chishui River basin in 1990, 1999, 2010 and 2018, the localization-corrected equivalent factor method and GIS spatial analysis techniques were used to analyze the land use change characteristics, the ecosystem services value (ESV) change characteristics and the effects of land use change on the change of ESV. The results showed that the area of cultivated land, grassland and unused land decreased, and the area of construction land, forest land and water increased from 1990 to 2018. The land use transfer was mainly reflected in the mutual flow between cultivated land-forest-grassland and the encroachment of construction land on cultivated land and grassland. From 1990 to 2018, ESV increased from 41.190 billion yuan to 41.354 billion yuan in Chishui River basin, forest land was the main contributing part of ESV, and the increase of water area was the main influencing factor of the increase of ESV. The spatial distribution of ESV showed the characteristics of "high in the middle reaches, low in the upper and lower reaches", and the distribution of high value areas overlapped highly with that of forest land. The continuous expansion of urban construction land caused a decrease in ESV, and forest land and watershed, and cropland and grassland contributed positively and negatively to ESV due to area changes, respectively. The implementation of policies such as the change of population structure between rural and urban areas, the return of farmland to forest and watershed ecological management had promoted an increase to ESV. © 2023 Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology.

TI  - Minnesota Electronic Health Record Consortium Covid-19 Project: Informing Pandemic Response Through Statewide Collaboration Using Observational Data
JO  - Public Health Reports
PY  - 2022
AB  - Objective: Robust disease and syndromic surveillance tools are underdeveloped in the United States, as evidenced by limitations and heterogeneity in sociodemographic data collection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota, we developed a federated data network in March 2020 using electronic health record (EHR) data from 8 multispecialty health systems. Materials and Methods: In this serial cross-sectional study, we examined patients of all ages who received a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test, had symptoms of a viral illness, or received an influenza test from January 3, 2016, through November 7, 2020. We evaluated COVID-19 testing rates among patients with symptoms of viral illness and percentage positivity among all patients tested, in aggregate and by zip code. We stratified results by patient and area-level characteristics. Results: Cumulative COVID-19 positivity rates were similar for people aged 12-64 years (range, 15.1%-17.6%) but lower for adults aged ≥65 years (range, 9.3%-10.7%). We found notable racial and ethnic disparities in positivity rates early in the pandemic, whereas COVID-19 positivity was similarly elevated across most racial and ethnic groups by the end of 2020. Positivity rates remained substantially higher among Hispanic patients compared with other racial and ethnic groups throughout the study period. We found similar trends across area-level income and rurality, with disparities early in the pandemic converging over time. Practice Implications: We rapidly developed a distributed data network across Minnesota to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the utility of using EHR data to monitor the current pandemic as well as future public health priorities. Building partnerships with public health agencies can help ensure data streams are flexible and tailored to meet the changing needs of decision makers. © 2022, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

TI  - Use Of Spectral Indices In The Characterization Of Vegetation Cover In The Caatinga Region Of The Semiarid Region Of Bahia
JO  - Revista de Geociencias do Nordeste
PY  - 2022
AB  - Given the importance to raise information that contributes to scientific dissemination, conservation of natural resources, and monitoring and planning of environmental policies in the Caatinga biome, this study aims to characterize the vegetation coverage and the carbon flow of the municipality of Central in the State of Bahia, which has an extensive area occupied by temporary crops. The characterization work was accomplished by applying the spectral indices NDVI, SAVI, EVI, and the CO2Flux during the dry and rainy months of 2020. Images of Sentinel-2, processed in a GIS environment were used. The results showed the highest values based on these indices in the rainy season (0.50 ┤1) distributed over a large area (NDVI: ~88%; SAVI: ~90%, EVI: ~81%). In the dry season, the values between 0 and 0.50 prevailed (NDVI: ~96.8%; SAVI: ~95%, EVI: ~94.8%) with values above 0.50 limited to riparian forests and alluvial areas. The rainy EVI presented lower values than the NDVI and SAVI about lower saturation. The urban area has been properly detailed in the rainy season images. Based on the indices, lower altitude zones presented higher values while higher areas had lower values. The CO2Flux showed that the carbon sequestration was more effective in the rainy period and presented a strong correlation among the indices. © 2022, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

TI  - Remote Sensing Et Of Alfalfa Using A Surface Aerodynamic Temperature Model
JO  - ASABE - 5th National Decennial Irrigation Conference 2010, Held in Conjunction with Irrigation Show 2010
PY  - 2010
AB  - Accurate estimates of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing algorithms could potentially improve crop water management. In addition, seasonal ET values could be used in assessing irrigation project efficiency, water use efficiency, ground water depletion, and the use of water rights over large irrigated areas. In this study, ET was mapped using airborne remote sensing model (SAT-ET) which uses inputs such as surface reflectance and radiometric surface temperature (Ts), and a surface aerodynamic temperature (To) sub-model. The SAT-ET model for irrigated alfalfa in Colorado was developed using surface temperature, horizontal wind speed and air temperature profile measurements, and with measurements of turbulent sensible heat fluxes (H) acquired with a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS). Estimates of the remote sensing-based ET for a 4.0 hectare alfalfa field, during the 2009 cropping season, were evaluated using a large weighing lysimeter (3.0 x 3.0 x 2.4 m) located at the Colorado State University (CSU) Arkansas Valley Research Center (AVRC) in Rocky Ford, CO. Hourly alfalfa ET was very well estimated with small errors of -5.8 to 1.1% while larger errors were found for estimates of daily ET (-13.5 to 17.8%). The To sub-model is very promising; however it needs to be further developed incorporating a wider range of crops and environmental and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism to extrapolate hourly to daily ET values needs to be investigated as well as the method to calculate reference ET for the conditions encountered in eastern Colorado.

TI  - Extracting Urban Vegetation Characteristics Using Spectral Mixture Analysis And Decision Tree Classifications
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2009
AB  - Urban vegetation cover is a critical component in urban systems modeling and recent advances in remote sensing technologies can provide detailed estimates of vegetation characteristics. In the present study we classify urban vegetation characteristics, including species and condition, using an approach based on spectral unmixing and statistically developed decision trees. This technique involves modeling the location and separability of vegetation characteristics within the spectral mixing space derived from high spatial resolution Quickbird imagery for the City of Vancouver, Canada. Abundance images, field based land cover observations and shadow estimates derived from a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surface model are applied to develop decision tree classifications to extract several urban vegetation characteristics. Our results indicate that along the vegetation-dark mixing line, tree and vegetated ground cover classes can be accurately separated (80\% and 94\% of variance explained respectively) and more detailed vegetation characteristics including manicured and mixed grasses and deciduous and evergreen trees can be extracted as second order hierarchical categories with variance explained ranging between 67\% and 100\%. Our results also suggest that the leaf-off condition of deciduous trees produce pixels with higher dark fractions resulting from branches and soils dominating the reflectance values. This research has important implications for understanding fine scale biophysical and social processes within urban environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intelligent Recognition Of Corn Residue Cover Area By Time-Series Sentinel-2a Images
JO  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Crop residue covering is an important way to reduce soil erosion and increase soil organic carbon, which is very important for black soil protection. Therefore, the accurate and rapid identification of corn residue cover area plays an important role in local government monitoring and promoting conservation tillage. The study area is located in Siping City, Jilin Province. Moreover, the time-series Sentinel-2A images collected from GEE (Google Earth Engine) cloud platform are used to capture spectral index based on the characteristics of the corn growing season and after harvest. Index features include Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Residue Index (NDRI). The time series feature values are sorted by size, and the quantile method is used to select quartile (QT) features at 0\% , 25\% , 50\% , 75\% , and 100\% to construct datasets. On this basis, the random forest method after parameter optimization is applied to train and verify the sample datasets divided according to 7 : 3, and then the datasets are classified, combined with the connected domain calibration method to remove the small connected domains generated in the classification process, and further optimize the global result. Through the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Kappa and Overall Accuracy (OA) the experimental results show that : (1) The quantitative evaluation results of the classification model (Ml/M2./M3/M4/M5) based on the dataset composed of the different feature are superior 90\%. Among them, the classification model M5 of the dataset designed in this paper has the best performance, of which Kappa and OA are 97. 41\% and 97. 91\% , respectively. Compared with the classification model M2 without the QT feature, the Kappa and OA are increased by 4. 52\% and 3. 64\% , respectively. At the same time, the M5 recognition result can effectively retain edge detail information; (2) For QT feature of different time scales, using the QT feature classification model M5\_6/M5 of time series remote sensing images from May to November can greatly restrain another crop residue. Compared with the Kappa and OA of the M5\_1 model classification result using only the QT features of the time series images in November, the Kappa and OA increased by 3. 9\% and 3. 12\% , respectively; (3) Based on the M5 model, the Kappa and OA of the classification model M6 combined with the connected domain calibration method are 96. 76\% and 97. 36\% respectively, second only to the recognition results of the M5 model. The model M6 avoids fine-grained patches while ensuring high accuracy and optimizing the classification visualization effect. Therefore, the M6 model proposed in this paper is suitable for identifying areas covered by corn residue in the study area. This method can be quickly implemented in the GEE cloud platform environment and is suitable for popularization and application in a corn residue covered areas in Northeast China.

TI  - Long-Term Follow-Up Of Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules Found Benign On Molecular Testing: A Validation Study
JO  - OTO OPEN
PY  - 2022
AB  - Objective Molecular testing has revolutionized management of indeterminate thyroid nodules (Bethesda categories III and IV). Few studies have attempted to validate the negative predictive value of molecular tests. Using long-term observation as a surrogate for surgical resection, we sought to examine the false-negative rate of "benign" indeterminate thyroid nodules on molecular testing. Study Design Case series with retrospective data collection and chart review. Setting Large community-based practice with multiple satellite offices. Methods All patients with thyroid nodules that underwent ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy between 2013 and 2019 were evaluated through retrospective analysis. Cytologically indeterminate nodules reflexively underwent molecular testing to guide clinical management. Observation was recommended for lesions with benign molecular testing, and these nodules were followed clinically and by ultrasound. Results A total of 2011 nodules underwent fine-needle aspiration, of which 280 (14\%) were indeterminate thyroid nodules. Of those 280 nodules, 100 (36\%) were benign on molecular testing. Three samples were excluded from analysis due to patient deaths from unrelated causes. Surgical resection was recommended in 16 of the 97 nodules (17\%), with the majority due to size and compressive symptoms. Histopathology was available in 14 nodules that underwent surgery, with 1 demonstrating minimally invasive follicular carcinoma. Conclusion While molecular testing is safe to use in guiding management of indeterminate thyroid nodules, consideration of individualized clinical factors and close long-term follow-up remains paramount.

TI  - Understanding Production Possibility Frontiers And Utility Values Of Ecosystem Services In The Himalayas: An Analysis Of The Supply-Demand Divide
JO  - Journal of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2023
AB  - Nature's services to humanity − ecosystem services (ES) − have been at the centre of natural resource management scholarship for the last few decades. Yet, quantification of ES supply and its economic valuation have dominated the academia. Spatial associations of multiple ES and their mutual production possibilities, social dimensions of ES demand, and the gaps between supply and demand of ES have not been sufficiently articulated in the literature, especially for the Himalayan landscapes. In this context, using satellite images, secondary data, and household survey (n = 300), we identified the supply-demand divide of ES by assessing production possibility frontiers and social demand of ES in the central regions of Hindu-Kush Himalayas. Among the six major ES that we considered in this research (crop production, timber production, carbon sequestration, water yield, soil conservation, and habitat quality), production possibilities of the other five ES get diminished with the increasing supply of crop production. Timber production, carbon sequestration, habitat quality, and soil conservation can be mutually incremental through the allocation of sufficient forestland areas. Local people's demand of water yield and crop production is very high as compared to those of the others, yet the current state of supply potential of those ES is largely inadequate to meet the demands. Instead of generalized management prescriptions, we recommend for the people- and place-based interventions in ecosystem management. Nonetheless, improved agronomic practices and integration of farming with forestry, carbon, and climate actions might be the safe operating space for sustainable landscape management in the Himalayas. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Satellite Risk Analysis Literature Review
JO  - AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2011
PY  - 2011
AB  - Risk management in the Government satellite community is a very vague term. Everyone wants to manage risk but no one seems to know a good way to accomplish it. The current method seems to be an eye catching stoplight table where one axis is likelihood of the risk occurring and the other is the level of consequence if it does occur. Then each risk is placed on this table based solely on the designer's opinion, most likely considering the consequence of having negative risks in front of an evaluator rather than the actual risk. This process also prevents the designer from taking into consideration the cost or value of the risk. This article explores the methods used by NASA and the finance community as well as a few other methods, such as discounted cash flow and the birdshot and buckshot methods, for handling risk to determine their usefulness to the Government satellite community. It also briefly examines some methods for calculating opportunity cost instead of solely calculating risk. Through the thorough investigation into these methods of calculating opportunity cost and performing risk assessment this research determined that when applied to Government satellite systems the methodologies proposed are not directly applicable. The techniques found in finance as well as at NASA are dependent on past data and statistical analysis that is not available to the majority of the satellite community. Most of the methods examined also rely on a company profit requirement and a free market that does not exist in the Government environment. However, it might be possible to modify some of these methods to enable the Government satellite community to use a version of them that has been tailored for their specific use. Further research is necessary to see if this concept would be possible and to determine if it is possible to develop a quantitative method for assessing both the risk and reward of a decision in a manner that eliminates as much of the human bias as possible. It is also necessary to look further into other industries and the commercial satellite community to see if other risk management processes exist that are more Government satellite community friendly. © 2011 by Abbie Stovall.

TI  - Quantitative Inversion Of Long Sequential Leaf Area Index Using Remote Sensing Based On Bp Neural Network From 1988 To 2013
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2018
AB  - Leaf Area Index(LAI) can reflect the horizontal coverage, vertical structure of vegetation, the thickness of the litter layer and the amount of underground biomass, which is the main aspect of vegetation affecting soil erosion. It is very important to monitor the changes in the amount of soil erosion, for useful information to guide the planning of soil and water conservation, protect the soil and water resources and control the soil erosion. Therefore, the method by which we obtain high quality and long sequential LAI at a regional scale is very important for analyzing the relationship between the dynamic changes in soil erosion and vegetation. Previous studies showed that the neural network had an incomparable superiority in terms of complex, nonlinear data fitting and pattern recognition, and had been successfully applied to inverse the LAI in Nanjing based on the multi-spectral remote sensing data derived from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager(OLI), four types of vegetation indices(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; Ratio Vegetation Index, RVI; Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index, SAVI; Modified Soil adjusted Vegetation Index, MSAVI), and measured LAI data. The results showed that the accuracy of retrieval was good. In this paper, we used the Back Propagation(BP) neural network model to inverse the LAI in Nanjing during 1988-2013 based on the data derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM). Based on the measured values of LAI in 2009 and 2010, the evaluation accuracy and adaptability of the model were verified and discussed. The results showed that:(1) The model had a fitting of higher degree, and average relative errors (MAPE), root mean square errors(RMSE), and correlation coefficients(R) in 2009 and 2010 of 0.2395 and 0.2174, 0.2962 and 0.2581, and 0.7713 and 0.6844, respectively. Each accuracy evaluation index was good. (2) Following statistical analysis, we found that the low vegetation coverage area (LAI < 2) exhibited an increasing trend, the high vegetation coverage area (LAI > 3) presented a first decreasing and then increasing trend, while the cultivated land area decreased with the rapid development in Nanjing.(3) To analyze accurately the LAI, we extracted the LAI in the main urban area, and found that there was a relatively high inversion value, and the inter-annual change in LAI was consistent with the change in vegetation coverage in Nanjing reported by other studies. Therefore, we could see that the BP neural network model had a high accuracy for the time series LAI inversion. It provides a new way for quantitative remote sensing monitoring of regional soil erosion. Moreover, because of other potential limiting factors, such as the errors produced by the BP neural network model, the large area of the inversion area, the complexity of vegetation types and community structure, etc., the inversion accuracy of LAI through remote sensing still needs to be explored, and the inversion method improved. We will try to establish a multi-angle LAI inversion method to construct the coupling model of LAI and soil erosion or quantitative fusion of multi-source remote sensing images in the future study. © 2018 Science Press.

JO  - TQM JOURNAL
PY  - 2023
AB  - Purpose This paper seeks to assess the capabilities and maturity of supply chain planning and product quality management systems implemented by the dairy industries in three different countries: Russia, Kazakhstan, and Lithuania. Design/methodology/approach Through a systematic analysis of statistical information, the descriptors of the logistics supply chain efficiency were identified. Directions for dairy supply chain management improvement were also highlighted. The study uses secondary statistics from open sources as a basis for the comparative analysis across a range of indicators, including the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), the dairy products quantity, the production volume of milk and dairy products, and other indicators characterizing the dairy industry. Findings The results of this study suggest the inconsistency and narrowness of single indexes and ranking, which are traditionally used to evaluate the logistics system. LPI values confirmed that the internal efficiency of the Lithuanian logistics system exceeds similar systems in Russia and Kazakhstan. Social implications In this paper, ways to improve supply chain management of dairy products in the context of globalization have been determined, the prerequisites for the formation of the perishable goods market according to the balance of supply and demand and the institutional mechanism of this process, which represents important information for all interested economic agents, have been analyzed. Originality/value The proposed approach points to the importance of having detailed information on the supply chain infrastructure and the need to introduce a single information space based on modern information and communication technologies.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50\%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

TI  - Eliminating Preoperative Lymphoscintigraphy In Extremity Melanomas
JO  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) is an imaging procedure routinely used to identify the draining nodal basin in melanomas. At our institute, we have traditionally performed preoperative LSG followed by intraoperative LSG for logistical and evaluative reasons. We sought to determine if preoperative LSG could be safely eliminated in the treatment of extremity melanomas, which exhibit consistent and predictable lymphatic drainage patterns. Methods: We reviewed the Yale Melanoma Registry 1308012545 for cutaneous extremity melanomas treated at our institution. From this registry, we calculated the incidence of atypical lymph node drainage patterns outside the axillary and inguinal regions. Based on these data, we eliminated preoperative LSG in 21 cases (8 upper extremities and 13 lower extremities). Additionally, we calculated the potential hospital charge reduction of forgoing preoperative LSG. Results: Upper and lower extremity melanomas treated at our institution exhibited atypical lymph node drainage at a rate of 3.4\% and 2.0\%, respectively. The sites of atypical drainage were to the epitrochlear and popliteal regions. In all 21 cases where preoperative LSG was eliminated, we were able to correctly identify the sentinel lymph node. The potential hospital charge reduction of forgoing preoperative LSG totaled \$2,393. Conclusions: Preoperative LSG can be safely eliminated in the management of upper and lower extremity melanomas. Exceptions may be considered for primary lesions of the posterior calf, ankle, and heel as well as for patients with history of prior surgery or radiation. Forgoing preoperative LSG results in a hospital charge reduction of \$2,393 and provides additional benefits to the patient. Ultimately, there is potential for significant charge reduction if applied across health care systems.

TI  - Modeling And Mapping Forest Biomass Using Forest Inventory And Landsat Tm Data: Results From The Foothills Model Forest, Alberta.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Forest biomass information is needed for reporting of selected indicators of sustainable forest management and for models that estimate carbon budgets and forest productivity, particularly within the context of a changing climate. In collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency, a strategy for mapping Canada's forest biomass has been developed as part of the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) project. This paper reports on the results derived from an application of this strategy to a pilot study area in the Foothills Model Forest, Alberta. Methods to estimate forest biomass have been developed using tree-level inventory plot data that is then extrapolated to the stand level by statistical relationships between biomass density and stand structural characteristics. These ground-based biomass estimates serve as source data that are related to stand structure derived from classified Landsat TM data. Models developed from inventory data to estimate biomass density attained adjusted R-2 values that ranged from 0.60 to 0.77 for 5 species groups, and tests with an independent validation sample compared favourably for all species (deciduous, lodgepole pine, mixed species, white spruce/fir), except black spruce/larch. Landsat-derived forest biomass was statistically and moderately correlated to the inventory-derived biomass with values of 0.63, 0.68, and 0.70 for conifer, deciduous, and mixed species, respectively. Research areas were identified from both inventory and remote sensing perspectives that will lead to incremental improvements in biomass estimation.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment Of Soil Condition, Basic Environmental Factors And Productivity Of Linum Usitatissimum In The Steppe Zone Of Kazakhstan Using The Remote Sensing Method
JO  - Brazilian Journal of Biology
PY  - 2023
AB  - The influence of environmental factors, such as lack of water and uneven rainfall, depletion of nutrients in the soil and reduced soil fertility, planting patterns and plant density, uneven growth stages, are the main limiting factors that hinder the growth of agricultural production in arid regions. The aim of the study was to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 to quantify soil conditions, which can improve the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics in organic agriculture in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan and improve productivity management of Linum usitatissimum. In the course of the research, the influence of individual factors of the general environmental impact, such as the influence of humidity, meteorological conditions, the content of individual nutrient components of the soil on the yield, was studied. The meteorological conditions in this region in 2021 and the data of agrochemical analysis of the soil on which the oilseed crop was grown were evaluated. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to determine the NDVI and GNDVI indices. A high content of nitrate nitrogen (12.3-16.2 mg/kg), a very low level of available phosphorus (3-10 mg/kg), and a high content of potassium (289-420 mg/kg) were found in the soil. A low content of humus (2.68-3.31%) and sulfur (1.1-4.9 mg/kg) was found. A study of the NDVI growth index showed that the highest value was reached by the period of July 20, 2021. After this period, a decrease in the vegetation index was observed. In conditions of severe drought, this change occurred earlier than under favorable conditions, and correlated with low flax yield (1.6-6.9 c/ha). This study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 for quantifying soil conditions, which not only improves our understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics and environmental components in organic agriculture in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan, but also improves the management of Linum usitatissimum productivity. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

TI  - Quantitative Human Risk Analysis Of 2015 Shenzhen Dump Failure Considering Influence Of Urbanization
JO  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
PY  - 2021
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, a large amount of construction spoil was stockpiled around cities and formed extensive dumps. Construction spoil is one of the main construction and demolition (C\&D) waste and municipal solid waste (MSW). Once the construction spoil dump becomes unstable, it will bring great risks to the surrounding residents. A catastrophic dump failure occurred on 20 December 2015 in Guangming New Strict, Shenzhen, China. Approximately 2.51x10(6) m(3) of construction waste slid out from the dumpsite, destroying 33 houses and causing total 77 casualties. This paper attempts to analyze the failure probability of the construction spoil dump using Monte Carlo simulation considering the spatial variability of soil properties, and to quantify the dynamic human risk considering the increasing urbanization. Influence of urbanization on the human element at risk is analyzed by referring to multi-temporal remote sensing images. A quantitative human risk assessment model is employed to determine the landslide human risk referring an assessment criteria curve between frequency of number fatalities and number of fatalities (F-N curve). It is found that the societal risk at daytime was 0.078, 0.088, and 1.432 in 2002, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Meanwhile, the societal risk at night was 0.034, 0.037, and 0.611 in 2002, 2014, and 2015, respectively. The quantitative method was benchmarked by the other landfill failure. It implies that the human risk increased with the development of urbanization and its value at daytime was approximately twice as much as at night. The new approach for the human risk assessment provides guidance for modern MSW landfills and highlights the obvious influence of urbanization on the human risk in other areas.

AB  - This paper discusses the ideas and methods of designing effective descriptors for identifying plant species of urban landscape vegetation. Fourteen of such descriptors induced from image spectrum, texture, and shape properties were designed. These descriptors were intended to meet such requirements as possessing a true physical or geometric implication relating to ecological significance, having a relatively steady segmentation threshold and being less sensitive to image types or environmental conditions during image acquisition. This study used decision trees to combine four selected descriptors for plant species identification, and the experiment was able to reach an error rate of 5.8% compared 25.9% by merely using the conventional pixel brightness values in plant species identification. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Estimations Of No<Sub><I>X</I></Sub> Emissions, No<Sub>2</Sub> Lifetime And Their Temporal Variation Over Three British Urbanised Regions In 2019 Using Tropomi No<Sub>2</Sub> Observations
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ATMOSPHERES
PY  - 2023
AB  - Quantification of air pollutant emissions is crucial to accurately model their concentrations. Nitrogen oxides (NOx: nitrogen dioxide NO2 and nitric oxide NO) have adverse effects on health, agriculture and natural ecosystems both directly and due to their role in the formation of secondary pollutants. This work estimates annual total NOx emissions, mean NO2 lifetime, their seasonal variation and the weekday-weekend effect, over three selected British urban areas with NO2 pollution (London, Manchester and Birmingham). The method combines an exponentially modified Gaussian fitting function and wind rotation technique, using TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 observations together with reanalysis wind fields. The analysis for 2019 yields total emissions of 113 kT of NOx over London, and 37 kT and 22 kT over Manchester and Birmingham, respectively. Compared to the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, this represents an increase of 6\% for Manchester, 18\% for London, and a decrease of 33\% for Birmingham. These values are improved compared to a recent published study finding larger discrepancies with the same inventory (from 55\% to 105\% for the relevant cities), despite some overall consistencies. The weekday NOx emissions are larger than at the weekend, by a factor of 1.54 for Manchester, 2.68 for London and 3.05 for Birmingham. Notably, it has been found Birmingham has a longer NO2 mean lifetime for weekdays (similar to 6 h) than for the weekends (similar to 2 h) and Manchester presents a mean NO2 lifetime almost 4 times higher in summer (6.13 h) than in autumn (1.64 h). More generally, the findings on emission, emission rate and lifetime suggest management of emissions might be needed for weekdays in London and Birmingham, and for weekends in Manchester.

TI  - The Application Of Geospatial Analyses To Support An Integrated Study Into The Ecological Character And Sustainable Use Of Lake Chilwa
JO  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
PY  - 2011
AB  - Wetlands, which occupy a considerable proportion of Malawi, are an important resource for the rural-poor. In regions of low and erratic rainfall, they provide important opportunities for agriculture and fisheries and are often vital for food security. However, overutilization and some farming practices can result in environmental degradation and the loss of valuable ecosystem services. The Lake Chilwa wetland, a complex aquatic ecosystem comprising a shallow open water lake surrounded by marsh and floodplain grassland, is one of the most important wetlands in Malawi. Most of the 1 million people who live in the vicinity of the lake derive their livelihoods from the wetland. Increases in population in recent decades have increased the pressures on the wetland. In light of continued population growth, it is anticipated that some levels of resource use may be difficult to sustain in the long-term. Consequently, planning the use of wetland resources is a priority if the diverse benefits that local communities presently receive are to be sustained. Baseline wetland information is needed to determine appropriate sustainable management plans, as well as to identify limits to resilience. However, for many wetlands in southern and eastern Africa, these data are lacking, or not available to those who need them. This paper provides an overview of the distribution and characteristics of wetlands in Malawi. Using lake Chilwa as an example, it illustrates how Earth Observation data, in combination with hydrometric and botanical data, can be used to provide information crucial for sustainable wetland management.

TI  - Apex Scavenger Movements Call For Transboundary Conservation Policies
JO  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2014
AB  - Current changes in the environment and increases in threats to wildlife have prompted the need for a better understanding of species' conservation requirements. Strategies for the conservation of large-sized animal species with large home ranges have included the creation of large protected areas, or for migrants, the creation of protected breeding, stop-over and wintering areas. We aim to describe the movement behaviour of Andean condors (Vulturgryphus), and to relate it to its significance in the conservation of this species and its environment. We examine whether current conservation strategies are sufficient to ensure the daily requirements of the species, and evaluate the degree to which breeding and foraging areas are covered by protected areas. We present as a new challenge the conservation of large-sized species that perform daily long-range movements across a number of political and ecological borders. Andean condors tagged with GPS-satellite transmitters make long daily flights from their breeding areas (mountains in Argentina and Chile) to their feeding areas (the steppe in Argentina) crossing over the Andean Cordillera. These flights demonstrate that current conservation strategies are insufficient to protect species with such daily movement patterns, and that new approaches are needed. Thus, it is necessary to gain a more in-depth knowledge of the movement ecology of these organisms through individual-level approaches integrating intrinsic (reproductive and foraging behaviour) and extrinsic (political and geomorphological boundaries) factors that shape movement patterns. Conservation efforts must include international cooperation aiming to combine the conservation of flagship species, the management of public and private lands, and the maintenance of valuable ecosystem services.

TI  - A Systemic Analysis Of The Impact Of The Pandemic On The Indian Tourism Economy
JO  - Margin
PY  - 2023
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the tourism industry across the world. Be it aviation or hospitality, transportation, tour operators or eateries, every activity related to tourism was adversely affected by the pandemic in an unprecedented manner. India saw the first severe impact during the first quarter of 2020–2021 when the tourism industry was severely affected, in terms of loss in tourism demand due to a significant fall in tourist arrivals. The industry saw gradual signs of recovery post-October 2020 but was hit again by the second wave during April–June 2021 and then by the third wave during November 2021–January 2022. Given the contribution that tourism makes to the entire economy in terms of income and employment generation, it is important to do a systemic estimation of the losses caused by the pandemic so that resilient policies are put in place to address the challenges at all levels and put the tourism sector back on the path it was traversing before the pandemic. This article presents the estimates of economic losses resulting from the changes experienced during the most critical period of the pandemic, that is, the first quarter of 2020–2021, which witnessed a complete lockdown, and the subsequent two quarters, wherein the sector started showing gradual recovery following various relaxations in economic activities and travel movements. The estimates are based on the methodology that draws from the framework laid out in the Tourism Satellite Account of India, which, in turn, is based on the methodological framework recommended by the United Nations World Tourism Organization.

TI  - Assessment Of Social Vulnerability Of Landslides In The Darjeeling District Using Mcda-Based Gis Techniques
JO  - Disaster Advances
PY  - 2022
AB  - The consequences or the result of any disaster or hazard's impact on society or nature is considered a vulnerability. In terms of landslide hazards, it causes many losses to the community such as the death of people, damage to property and damage to nature. Social vulnerability is measured with different scales depending on the area of the occurrence. In this study, a social vulnerability was conducted to identify the socially vulnerable zones such as people and property. The study was conducted in the Darjeeling district, West Bengal (26027” N to 27013” N latitudes and 87059” E to 88053” E longitudes). The main objective of this study is to find out the area under vulnerable zones. With the help of the GIS platform and Data available from the DDMA handbook and Census 2011, the social vulnerable map was created. In this study, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)17 was applied to determine the weighted values of each factor i.e. Population Distribution, Literacy Rate, Non-working population etc. All the parameters were put into Arc GIS based on each parameter’s weighted values and the final output of social vulnerability was prepared. The result showed that 26% area comes under high vulnerable zones and 4% are in very high vulnerable zones. The southern part of the district comes under high to very high vulnerable zones due to the high population density and high settlement density. © 2022, World Research Association.

This article summarizes our views-as experts in multidisciplinary field of vaccinology (consisting of an anthropologist, a public health policy advisor, a vaccine industry expert, a health care journalist and a practicing physician)-which were presented at a satellite symposium held at the 33rd European Society of Paediatric Infectious Disease conference in Leipzig, Germany, in May 2015. This article aims to suggest and recommend strategies to promote vaccination awareness, and highlight proactive measures for building, maintaining and enhancing trust in vaccination through innovative communication and evidence-based interaction with the end user. We believe that converting the results of vaccine research into a successful vaccination program, and replacing misinformation with evidence-based communication, will require a multidisciplinary approach that embraces modern digital and tailored applications to reach out to all populations.

They range from training simulators like flight or harvester simulators to economic and ecological simulations for tree growth or succession. The nD forest simulation and information system integrates the necessary methods for data extraction, modeling, and management of highly realistic models. Using semantic world modeling, tree data can efficiently be extracted from remote sensing data - even for very large areas. Data is modeled using a GML-based modeling language and a flexible data management approach is integrated to provide caching, persistence, a central communication hub, and a versioning mechanism. Combining various simulation techniques and data versioning, the nD forest simulation and information system can provide applications with historic 3D data in multiple time dimensions (hence nD) as well as with predicted data based on simulations. © 2018, IGI Global.

TI  - Improvement Of Landslide Spatial Modeling Using Machine Learning Methods And Two Harris Hawks And Bat Algorithms
JO  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landslide is a natural phenomenon that can turn into a natural disaster. The main goal of this research was to spatial prediction of a high-risk region located in the Zagros mountains, Iran, using hybrid machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms, namely the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), the Harris hawks optimisation (HHO), and the bat algorithm (BA). The landslide occurrences were first divided into training and testing datasets with a 70/30 ratio. Fourteen landslide-related factors were considered, and the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) were employed to determine the correlation between landslides and factors. After that, the hybrid models of ANFIS-HHO, ANFIS-BA, SVR-HHO and SVR-BA were applied to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs). Finally, in order to validation and comparison of the applied models, two indexes, namely mean square error (MSE) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC), were used. According to the validation results, the AUROC values for the ANFIS-HHO, ANFIS-BA, SVR-HHO and SVR-BA were 0.849, 0.82, 0.895, and 0.865, respectively. The SVR-HHO showed the highest accuracy, with AUROC of 0.895 and lowest MSE of 0.147, and ANFIS-BA showed the least accuracy with an AUROC value of 0.82 and MSE value of 0.218. Based on the results, although four hybrid models with more than 80\% accuracy can generate very good results, the SVR is superior to the ANFIS model, whereas the HHO algorithm outperformed the bat algorithm. The map generated in this study can be employed by land use planners in more efficient management.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Remote Monitoring Of Defoliation By The Beech Leaf-Mining Weevil <I>Rhynchaenus Fagi</I> In Northern Spain
JO  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2015
AB  - Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests are among the most widespread and emblematic deciduous forests in Europe, frequently serving as refuge for several endangered species. Populations of the beech leaf-miner weevil Rhynchaenus fagi, a common specific defoliator, usually remain at endemic levels for long periods, but outbreaks occasionally occur under favorable conditions, causing extensive defoliation and forest decline. Monitoring defoliation is highly relevant to integrated beech management, particularly in the beech forests of northern Spain, located in the southernmost range of the Cantabrian Mountains. Monitoring and mapping damage using multispectral satellite remote sensing may be a suitable, cost-effective option in these rugged areas. One hundred eleven defoliation field records from 17 inventory plots over an 8-year period were spectrally related to ten Landsat vegetation indices. A sigmoidal mixed-effects model as a function of vegetation index change for predicting R. fagi defoliation in beech stands was developed based on a recently proposed general Landsat model. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI, Band-5/Band-4) was the best fitted model. The AMSI defoliation model yielded 4.0\% RMSE and 3.1\% MAE defoliation estimated errors and a significant accuracy of 0.685 R-2 (p < 0.0001) or 0.632 Nagelkerke's R-2. Model was applied to map the spatial temporal pattern of R. fagi defoliation on beech stands, and a trend of defoliation oscillation was observed in the area during the 8 year study. Remote sensing-based model represents a cost-effective tool for health monitoring in large, difficult to access, forested mountain areas, such as those studied. Forest management programs, as those aimed to habitat conservation of southern Cantabrian beech forests, will greatly benefit from remote mapping and the assessment of stand vulnerability to insect damage and other disturbances in current climate warming scenarios.

TI  - Geospatial Soil Sensing System (Geos3): A Powerful Data Mining Procedure To Retrieve Soil Spectral Reflectance From Satellite Images
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Soil mapping has been identified as key to environmental issues. The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km2. The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the ‘true’ but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Combining Spatial And Economic Criteria In Tree-Level Harvest Planning
JO  - Forest Ecosystems
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: Modern remote sensing methods enable the prediction of tree-level forest resource data. However, the benefits of using tree-level data in forest or harvest planning is not clear given a relative paucity of research. In particular, there is a need for tree-level methods that simultaneously account for the spatial distribution of trees and other objectives. In this study, we developed a spatial tree selection method that considers tree-level (relative value increment), neighborhood related (proximity of cut trees) and global objectives (total harvest). Methods: We partitioned the whole surface area of the stand to trees, with the assumption that a large tree occupies a larger area than a small tree. This was implemented using a power diagram. We also utilized spatially explicit tree-level growth models that accounted for competition by neighboring trees. Optimization was conducted with a variant of cellular automata. The proposed method was tested in stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) stands in Spain where we implemented basic individual tree detection with airborne laser scanning data. Results: We showed how to mimic four different spatial distributions of cut trees using alternative weightings of objective variables. The Non-spatial selection did not aim at a particular spatial layout, the Single-tree selection dispersed the trees to be cut, and the Tree group and Clearcut selections clustered harvested trees at different magnitudes. Conclusions: The proposed method can be used to control the spatial layout of trees while extracting trees that are the most economically mature. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Vegetation Ndvi Linked To Temperature And Precipitation In The Upper Catchments Of Yellow River
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING \& ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2012
AB  - Vegetation in the upper catchment of Yellow River is critical for the ecological stability of the whole watershed. The dominant vegetation cover types in this region are grassland and forest, which can strongly influence the eco-environmental status of the whole watershed. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for grassland and forest has been calculated and its daily correlation models were deduced by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products on 12 dates in 2000, 2003, and 2006. The responses of the NDVI values with the inter-annual grassland and forest to three climatic indices (i.e., yearly precipitation and highest and lowest temperature) were analyzed showing that, except for the lowest temperature, the yearly precipitation and highest temperature had close correlations with the NDVI values of the two vegetation communities. The value of correlation coefficients ranged from 0.815 to 0.951 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the interactions of NDVI values of vegetation with the climatic indicators at monthly interval were analyzed. The NDVI of vegetation and three climatic indices had strong positive correlations (larger than 0.733, p < 0.01). The monthly correlations also provided the threshold values for the three climatic indictors, to be used for simulating vegetation growth grassland under different climate features, which is essential for the assessment of the vegetation growth and for regional environmental management.

TI  - Mapping Soil Organic Carbon Stocks In Tunisian Topsoils
JO  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
PY  - 2022
AB  - Better knowledge of the amount and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at national level is a key element for monitoring, planning and decision-making regarding soil quality management, agriculture or carbon storage options. The present study proposes for the first time a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) initiative to map SOC stocks in Tunisian topsoils (0-30 cm) at 100 m resolution, using a Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm, a range of environmental covariates, and a national database of 1540 SOC stock profiles. Our results provided a revised assessment of the SOC stock on the Tunisian territory at 391Tg C in the first 30 cm of soil profile, i.e. an average of 2.53 kg m-2. The map of SOC stocks outperformed global DSM products such as SoilGrids 2.0 in both R2 (0.44 vs. 0.15) and RMSE (1.94 vs. 2.52 kg m-2) and can be used as a benchmark against changes of land use and climate. The importance of the environmental covariates tested indicates the major role of bioclimatic data and, to a lesser extent, remote sensing images and topography-related variables. Our study did not show a significant added value of using additional covariates in relation to nationally available variables or the SOC map predicted by SoilGrids2.0. Finally, our results showed that increasing the quality and quantity of soil profile observations is most likely the best way to improve the future SOC map, starting with the northern region of Tunisia, which has the highest SOC stock predictions and uncertainties in the country. An alternative way would be the exploration of new covariates through sub-national approaches.

TI  - Chirp Program Lessons Learned From The Contractor Program Management Team Perspective
PY  - 2012
AB  - With shrinking budgets and expanding program costs, government program offices are seeking innovative ways to accomplish their goals with better efficiency and less cost. In 2008, the U. S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center's Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XRF) took a bold step in this direction and funded a new program that started as an unsolicited proposal from SES Government Solutions, and its industry teammates, Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The program called for hosting of an Air Force furnished infrared sensor, developed by SAIC, on an SES commercial communications satellite, built by Orbital, and was appropriately referred to as CHIRP (Commercially Hosted Infra-Red Payload). This bold new effort has been a resounding success and has stimulated a whole new market area for hosted payloads that is now germinating throughout the aerospace industry. The concept of a staring sensor using large format focal plane arrays began as a risk reduction program by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Under that program (the Alternate InfraRed Satellite System (AIRSS) or Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) program), SAIC developed a laboratory model of a full-earth, four-telescope staring Overhead Persistent InfraRed (OPIR) sensor for ground validation. For the CHIRP contract, but under the 3GIRS umbrella, SAIC designed and developed a space-qualified, one-quarter earth, single OPIR staring telescope for a technical demonstration in space. The satellite was built by Orbital Sciences as part of an existing commercial contract with SES. The sensor and satellite efforts were leveraged by the CHIRP program, integrating the government furnished equipment (GFE) sensor with the commercial SES-2 telecommunications satellite. The CHIRP program uses contractor ground system facilities and mission operations teams to operate and evaluate the CHIRP system, including sensor commanding, state-of-health monitoring, sensor calibration and characterization, and tracking algorithm assessment on the ground using on-orbit data. The satellite is operated by SES through its commercial satellite operations center (SOC). By design, CHIRP operations are completely independent of spacecraft operations except for initial deployments and CHIRP power on/off activities. Sensor commands are generated at SAIC's CHIRP Mission Analysis Center (CMAC) in Seal Beach, California, transmitted through Orbital's CHIRP Mission Operations Center (CMOC) in Dulles, Virginia, and uplinked to the spacecraft by the SES-operated teleport in Woodbine, Maryland. The CHIRP mission data is transmitted from the CHIRP payload through an Orbital-developed Secondary Payload Interface (SPI) on the spacecraft, where it is encrypted and transmitted to the ground through one of the commercial transponders. The ground entry point for the CHIRP data is a SES teleport, which transmits the data to the CMOC for dissemination in real-time to the CMAC and the U. S. Air Force's Advanced Fusion Center (AFC). The CMOC and CMAC are accredited to handle collateral classified data, while the SES facilities are commercial entities with no access to classified data. The CHIRP program is a truly ground breaking, but like many early endeavors had to overcome challenges along the way. However, at the end of the day, the CHIRP team: a) Space-qualified a ground-breaking wide-field-of-wiew (WFOV), OPIR sensor designed and developed by SAIC in two years on the 3GIRS program; b) Integrated the payload onto a commercial communications satellite platform, including all payload accommodations for heat, power, and commanding, and tested the payload within the commercial integration and testing (I\&T) flow; c) Launched and flew the sensor in space a little over three years from the start of the contract; d) Demonstrated the agility and flexibility of the commercially hosted payload concept, which included accommodating a payload development within commercial schedules; e) Delivered a sensor to orbit that was operational and performing its mission two days before the satellite arrived at its operational orbital location and within 24 hours of removal of the baffle cover; f) Proved that classified systems can be operated as a commercially hosted payload; and g) Showed that high quality commercial buses can support demanding optical missions. The CHIRP program uncovered and resolved several hosted payload-related challenges and pioneered solutions for future hosted payloads in areas ranging from contracts to space policy, weight/power/thermal accommodations, security and cultural differences between the commercial and government environments. The main take-away from this unique program is that by working closely together, with a common goal, both government and industry can benefit greatly from the hosted payload model.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Retrieval Of Suspended Solids Based On Improved Pso-Lssvm At The Harbin Section Of The Songhua River
JO  - Huanjing Kexue Xuebao/Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae
PY  - 2014
AB  - Suspended solid is one of the most important parameters for evaluating water qualities and water environmental conditions of the Songhua River. In this study, both observed hyperspectral and suspended solids concentration data were used, which were derived from 29 samples at the Harbin section of the Songhua River. Among those data, 20 were served as training set and 9 were designated as testing set. In order to retrieve the suspended solids, machine learning and intelligent calculation method for global optimization were performed. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) parameters were optimized by improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Based on root mean square error (RMSE, as a proxy of fitness function), LSSVM optimal parameters were obtained with permutations. We defined the spectral reflectance ratios of 700 nm and 750 nm (R700/R750) as feature variables and the concentration data of suspended solids as target variables, and carried out the retrieval model from the training set. Afterwards, the retrieval model was evaluated by the testing set. The results demonstrated that the retrieval model had fast convergence rate and high precision with a low RMSE of predicted values (10.11mg·L-1), a low MAPE(10.72%) and a high R2 (0.952). In a word, the results suggested that the method can be used to provide reference for retrieval and prediction of other water quality parameters.

TI  - Intraoperative Immunohistochemistry Staining Of Sentinel Nodes In Breast Cancer: Clinical And Economical Implications
JO  - Breast
PY  - 2008
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate intraoperative immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of sentinel nodes in primary breast cancer surgery. We analysed retrospectively 1209 consecutive sentinel node procedures and compared the rate of late positive metastases in sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and the duration of the surgical procedures before (n = 706) and after (n = 503) introducing intraoperative IHC on frozen section. We also did a cost analysis. Intraoperative IHC staining led to a lowering of the late positive SNB rate. Introducing IHC gave a decrease in the late positive rate from 93 to 52% (p < 0.0001) for isolated tumour cell metastasis, from 56 to 36.4% (p < 0.02) for micrometastasis, and from 16 to 5% (p < 0.01) for macrometastasis. The surgical procedures were slightly prolonged for lumpectomies but not for mastectomies after introducing intraoperative IHC staining. The cost analysis showed an overall cost saving of approximately 40%. In conclusion, intraoperative IHC staining of the SNB lowered the late positive rate and gave an overall cost saving. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Use Of Remote Sensing Technologies For Building Damage Assessment After The 2003 Bam, Iran, Earthquake-Preface To Remote Sensing Papers
JO  - Earthquake Spectra
PY  - 2005
AB  - This preface introduces a series of papers that describe the use of remote sensing technologies in quantifying the extent of building damage after the 2003 Bam, Iran, earthquake. These papers represent a significant milestone in post-earthquake loss estimation. For the first time, independent evaluations of regional damage are documented, which will ultimately allow an assessment of the efficacy of these technologies as tools for post-earthquake damage detection and quantification. Not only were different sensors used, but radically different approaches were implemented in quantifying damage. The conclusions and recommendations of the different papers are generally consistent and strongly suggest that regional damage assessment using remotely sensed data is highly feasible. The papers, however, acknowledge that more research is needed before these technologies can be used to make critical emergency response decisions. Finally, the role of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute through its Learning From Earthquakes Program is acknowledged, largely for helping to promote the use of remote sensing technologies in earthquake studies and for recognizing the value of collaboration through its newly formed Subcommittee on Remote Sensing. © 2005, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.

TI  - St. Gallen/Vienna 2019: A Brief Summary Of The Consensus Discussion On The Optimal Primary Breast Cancer Treatment
JO  - BREAST CARE
PY  - 2019
AB  - This year, the St. Gallen Consensus Conference on early breast cancer treatment standards took place for the third time in Vienna, Austria, which is where the next conference will also take place (next date: March 17-20, 2021!). Once again, more than 3,000 participants from over 100 countries came together, and, overall, the 2019 St. Gallen/Vienna conference was a great success. After 3 days of reviews conducted by a global faculty concerning the most important evidence published in the last 2 years, the Consensus votes' challenge was to define the impact on routine everyday practice. This year, the conference's main theme was the optimization of early breast cancer therapies by assessment of the magnitude of benefit, aiming at further refinement when compared to de-escalation and escalation, which were mainly the topic of the 2017 conference. Patient empowerment and the importance of shared decision-making were particularly emphasized. The traditional panel votes were moderated by Eric Winer from Harvard, and for the most part, they managed to clarify most of the critical questions. This brief report by Editors of Breast Care summarizes the results of the 2019 international panel votes with respect to locoregional and systemic treatment as a quick news update for our readers, but it expressly does not intend to replace the official St. Gallen Consensus publication that will follow shortly in Annals of Oncology.

TI  - Shadow Removal In High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
JO  - Communications in Computer and Information Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - In satellite image processing, obscure zones that were affected by shadows are normally discarded from further processing. Nevertheless, for specific applications, such as surveillance, it is desirable to remove shadows despite the fact that reconstructed zones do not necessarily have real reflectance values. In that sense, we propose a shadow removal method in high-resolution satellite images using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). The generator network is trained to produce shadow-free RGB images with condition on a satellite image patch altered with artificial shadows and concatenated with its respective binary shadow mask, while the discriminator is adversely trained to discern if a given shadow-free image comes from the generator or if it is an original RGB image without artificial alteration. The method is tested in the proposed dataset achieving an error ratio comparable with the state of the art. Finally, we confirm the feasibility of the proposed network using real shadowed images. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - The Public Health Applications Of Unlinked Anonymous Seroprevalence Monitoring For Hiv In The United Kingdom
JO  - International Journal of Epidemiology
PY  - 2000
AB  - Background: In order to monitor the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), integrated national programmes of unlinked anonymous (blinded) HIV serosurveys have taken place in the UK since 1990. Methods: The programmes comprise multi-centre surveys primarily using specimens gathered routinely for screening groups of patients. All specimens are irreversibly unlinked from patient identifiers before being tested. Results: The surveys have met their prime aim of providing at low cost minimally biased estimates of current HIV prevalence and trends in sentinel populations. The surveys have remained acceptable to professionals and the public, being successfully implemented without breech of their founding principles. The findings have had major public health applications, have influenced HIV policy and funding, been used for monitoring the spread of HIV, for targeting and evaluating health promotion and improving projections of severe HIV disease. The surveys have detected substantial prevalence rises and under-diagnosis of HIV which would otherwise have been unrecognised. The programmes' value is being increased by sub-typing HIV-1 isolates, capturing additional demographic information to detect spread among minority groups. The same specimens are used for monitoring other infections (initially hepatitis A, B and C). Conclusions: Monitoring HIV and other infections through unlinked anonymous HIV surveillance has become an integral essential part of national HIV and AIDS surveillance. Although it has unique applications the value of unlinked anonymous surveillance is maximized when used in conjunction with behavioural data, information from HIV and AIDS reporting, and behavioural data and surveillance for other sexually transmitted infections.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Tropical Coastal Resources: Progress And Fresh Challenges For The New Millennium
JO  - Seas at the millennium - an environmental evaluation - Volume 3
PY  - 2000
AB  - Interest in mapping tropical coastal resources using remote sensing has never been so extensive. Tropical coastal resources are vital to many national economies but are threatened by development, over-fishing and large-scale climatic phenomena including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Remote sensing is the only practicable means of making large-scale synoptic assessments of coastal resources and we are entering an age of unprecedented access to remotely sensed data. Generally speaking, airborne sensors with high spectral and spatial resolution distinguish finer biological detail than coarser resolution satellite sensors. The current mapping capabilities for the major tropical systems of mangrove, seagrass and reefs are: mangrove boundaries, mangrove canopy height and closure, mangrove leaf area index, seagrass boundaries, seagrass density (three classes), seagrass standing crop, reef geomorphology, reef habitats (assemblages of species and associated substrata), and living/non-living coral colonies in very shallow clear water (<1 m). Not all parameters of interest to scientists and managers can be mapped. Further research, and possibly new sensors, are needed to map coral versus algal cover and seagrass species composition. Ecologists face the important challenge of embracing spatially explicit data on coastal resources. Spatial data need to be incorporated into ecosystem process models to help bridge the gap in scale between most field studies and functional ecosystems. As remote sensing of coastal resources becomes more sophisticated (i.e. better data and analyses), the benefits of obtaining such data will grow through development of more advanced, and potentially useful, applications. I argue that the economics of undertaking remote sensing should be assessed in parallel with such developments in order to prevent over-selling or under-exploitation of the technology.

TI  - Using Data From Earth Observation To Support Sustainable Development Indicators: An Analysis Of The Literature And Challenges For The Future
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework aims to end poverty, improve health and education, reduce inequality, design sustainable cities, support economic growth, tackle climate change and leave no one behind. To monitor and report the progress on the 231 unique SDGs indicators in all signatory countries, data play a key role. Here, we reviewed the data challenges and costs associated with obtaining traditional data and satellite data (particularly for developing countries), emphasizing the benefits of using satellite data, alongside their portal and platforms in data access. We then assessed, under the maturity matrix framework (MMF 2.0), the current potential of satellite data applications on the SDG indicators that were classified into the sustainability pillars. Despite the SDG framework having more focus on socio-economic aspects of sustainability, there has been a rapidly growing literature in the last few years giving practical examples in using earth observation (EO) to monitor both environmental and socio-economic SDG indicators; there is a potential to populate 108 indicators by using EO data. EO also has a wider potential to support the SDGs beyond the existing indicators.

TI  - Assessing Impact Of Super Cyclone Amphan On Natural Vegetation In Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
JO  - Agriculture and Climatic Issues in South Asia: Geospatial Applications
PY  - 2023
AB  - Cyclones, floods, and storm surges threaten the fragile Sundarban Biosphere Reserve of India. Super cyclone Amphan on 20 May 2020, devastated Indian Sundarban. Using support vector machine, this study sought to identify vegetation degradation and its effects on land use/land cover (LULC). In this analysis, Sentinel-2A with 10-m resolution has been utilized to evaluate the progressions of pre-cyclone and post-cyclone conditions. Additionally, using the confusion matrix, the accuracy of these methods was assessed. The LULC change detection has been analysed following an accuracy assessment. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps were produced for pre-cyclone and post-cyclone. NDVI threshold value before and after cyclone clearly shows that dense vegetation converted to sparse vegetation and fallow land. The result indicates that the super cyclone Amphan caused a significant reduction in forest cover of about 38.8% across the world. Additionally, there is a 49.51%, 39.57%, 17.40%, and 6.93% expansion of agricultural land, swamp, sand, and beaches respectively. The findings of the study may be used by local and state disaster management agencies to create efficient disaster management strategies. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Rukhsana Sarkar, Asraful Alam and Azizur Rahman Siddiqui; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - Ecosystem Services Provided By Waterbirds
JO  - Biological Reviews
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ecosystem services are ecosystem processes that directly or indirectly benefit human well-being. There has been much recent literature identifying different services and the communities and species that provide them. This is a vital first step towards management and maintenance of these services. In this review, we specifically address the waterbirds, which play key functional roles in many aquatic ecosystems, including as predators, herbivores and vectors of seeds, invertebrates and nutrients, although these roles have often been overlooked. Waterbirds can maintain the diversity of other organisms, control pests, be effective bioindicators of ecological conditions, and act as sentinels of potential disease outbreaks. They also provide important provisioning (meat, feathers, eggs, etc.) and cultural services to both indigenous and westernized societies. We identify key gaps in the understanding of ecosystem services provided by waterbirds and areas for future research required to clarify their functional role in ecosystems and the services they provide. We consider how the economic value of these services could be calculated, giving some examples. Such valuation will provide powerful arguments for waterbird conservation. © 2013 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

TI  - L-Unet: Lightweight Network For Road Extraction In Cloud Occlusion Scene
JO  - Journal of Image and Graphics
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective: Road extraction is one of the primary tasks in the field of remote sensing. It has been applied in many areas, such as urban planning, route optimization, and navigation. Especially in the event of disasters such as mudslides, floods, and earthquakes, road information will suddenly change. Embedding road extraction models on the mobile terminal has an essential application value for rapid rescue. In recent years, deep learning has provided new ideas for realizing road pixel-level extraction, such as the classic image segmentation network UNet and the improved road extraction networks based on UNet, such as Residual UNet, LinkNet, and D-LinkNet. They can achieve road extraction better than traditional methods based on primary image feature extraction. However, these methods that rely on deep convolutional networks still have two problems: 1) cloud occlusion seriously affects the retrieval of information about ground objects in remote sensing images. At present, these convolutional network models are all trained on clear remote sensing images and do not consider the effect of cloud occlusion on road extraction. Their road extraction performance on cloudy remote sensing images is substantially reduced. 2) Network lightweight design has been an engaging area of research for several years. None of the above models based on deep learning considers the lightweight design of deep convolutional networks, which adds considerable difficulty to the deployment of these models. To address these road extraction problems, a lightweight UNet (L-UNet) is proposed, and road extraction is implemented in an end-to-end manner in the cloud occlusion scene. Method: 1) To address the problem of cloud occlusion, the Perlin noise is used to simulate a cloud layer image, and then the artificial cloud layer image and an RGB remote sensing image merge through the alpha coefficient to simulate the cloud occlusion scene. This simulation method is used to extend the cloudless road extraction dataset. Specifically, 20 000 artificial cloud layer images have been generated before the network training. During training, cloud layer images are randomly sampled with replacement. The selected cloud layer image is merged with the clear remote sensing image in the training dataset, thereby simulating the continually changing cloud occlusion scenes. 2) In terms of network lightweight, UNet, a fully convolutional neural network, is improved to obtain L-UNet. The main improvement is the use of mobile inverted bottleneck convolutional blocks (MBConv) in the encoder. The MBConv first uses depthwise separable convolution, which considerably reduces the number of network params. However, the performance of road extraction only using depthwise separable convolution is not ideal; thus, expand convolution is added. Expand convolution with several 1×1 convolution kernels can increase the number of feature channels for each layer in the encoder part. Therefore, each layer of the network can learn more abundant features. The MBConv also uses a squeeze-and-excitation block. The block consists of two parts: global pooling for squeeze and 1×1 convolution with swish function for excitation. The squeeze-and-excitation block rationalizes the relative weights between the output feature maps of each layer. It highlights the feature information related to roads and clouds, which is beneficial to the segmentation tasks. Moreover, the swish is selected as the activation function rather than the rectified linear unit (ReLU). The L-UNet model reduces the param of the original UNet model and achieves better results. 3) The training loss function is the sum of the binary cross-entropy loss and the dice coefficient loss. The optimizer for network training is Adam, which has an initial learning rate of 2E-4. The encoder parameters of L-UNet are initialized to "ImageNet" pretrained model parameters. Then, the training is finetuned. The PyTorch deep learning framework is selected to implement L-UNet model construction and experiment. L-UNet performs 233 epochs of training on wo NVIDIA GTX 1080 TI GPUs and finally converges. Result: Network training and comparison experiments are carried out on the DeepGlobe road extraction extended dataset. 1) In the trial of comparing the network structure, the baseline network is UNet# that only contains depthwise separable convolution. When the expand convolution and squeeze-and-excitation block are added separately, the corresponding intersection over union (IoU) values increase by 1.12% and 8.45%, respectively. Adding the expand convolution and squeeze-and-excitation block simultaneously increases the IoU index by 16.24%. 2) L-UNet is compared with other networks on the extended test dataset. The IoU index of L-UNet rises by 4.65% compared with UNet. The IoU index increases by 1.97% compared with D-LinkNet, which is the second most powerful. The L-UNet param is only 22.28 M, which is 1/7 of UNet and 1/5 of D-LinkNet. The Mask-IoU and Mask-P indices, which are used to measure the network's road prediction performance in the cloud occlusion area, are also higher than those of other networks. 3) For road extraction tests on several real cloudy remote sensing images from Sentinel-2 satellite, the performance of L-UNet remains the best. The average IoU of the detection results is higher than D-LinkNet's 19.47% and UNet's 31.87%. Conclusion: This paper studies the problem of road extraction from remote sensing images in cloud occlusion scenes. Simulated cloud layers are added on existing datasets, and extended datasets are used to improve the robustness of existing deep learning-based methods against cloud occlusion interference. The proposed L-UNet network architecture dramatically reduces the param and has excellent performance for road extraction given cloud cover. It can even predict road labels under thick clouds through known visible road edges and trends; thus, its road detection results have a better consistency. Other tasks for extracting remotely sensed ground objects with cloud cover can also use our method in future work. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics. All right reserved.

TI  - Robust Initial Wetness Condition Framework Of An Event-Based Rainfall-Runoff Model Using Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture
JO  - WATER
PY  - 2017
AB  - Runoff prediction in limited-data areas is vital for hydrological applications, such as the design of infrastructure and flood defenses, runoff forecasting, and water management. Rainfall-runoff models may be useful for simulation of runoff generation, particularly event-based models, which offer a practical modeling scheme because of their simplicity. However, there is a need to reduce the uncertainties related to the estimation of the initial wetness condition (IWC) prior to a rainfall event. Soil moisture is one of the most important variables in rainfall-runoff modeling, and remotely sensed soil moisture is recognized as an effective way to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction. In this study, the IWC was evaluated based on remotely sensed soil moisture by using the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, which is one of the representative event-based models used for reducing the uncertainty of runoff prediction. Four proxy variables for the IWC were determined from the measurements of total rainfall depth (API(5)), ground-based soil moisture (SSMinsitu), remotely sensed surface soil moisture (SSM), and soil water index (SWI) provided by the advanced scatterometer (ASCAT). To obtain a robust IWC framework, this study consists of two main parts: the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture, and the evaluation of runoff prediction using four proxy variables with a set of rainfall-runoff events in the East Asian monsoon region. The results showed an acceptable agreement between remotely sensed soil moisture (SSM and SWI) and ground based soil moisture data (SSMinsitu). In the proxy variable analysis, the SWI indicated the optimal value among the proposed proxy variables. In the runoff prediction analysis considering various infiltration conditions, the SSM and SWI proxy variables significantly reduced the runoff prediction error as compared with API(5) by 60\% and 66\%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed IWC framework with remotely sensed soil moisture indicates an improved Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency from 0.48 to 0.74 for the four catchments in the Korean Peninsula. It can be concluded that the SCS-CN method extended with remotely sensed soil moisture for reducing uncertainty in the runoff prediction and the proxy variables obtained from the soil moisture data provided by the ASCAT can be useful in enhancing the accuracy of runoff prediction over a range of spatial scales.

TI  - Preliminary Evaluation Of Air Temperature Reduction Of Urban Green Spaces In Beijing
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2012
AB  - Climate change is the most serious problem we face in the 21st century. Accompanied by the rapid expansion of cities worldwide, the phenomenon of urban heat islands has become a critical environmental issue in many large cities, since it is associated with a warmer climate. An exposure to higher temperatures can result in a spectrum of outcomes in the realms of human health and well-being. These outcomes range from mild discomfort to life-threatening medical conditions. Fortunately, trees and vegetation in the urban environment help to cool urban climates. This occurs through shading and evapotranspiration. Although there have been numerous studies on microclimate-adjusting effects of urban green spaces, few of these studies quantify the economic value of air temperature reduction provided by these spaces. This is especially true for cities suffering from the heat island effect. Urban heat island conditions have been observed for more than half a century in the city of Beijing. The area affected by this heat island rapidly expanded from 111 km2 in 1987 to 292 km2 in 2009, and the percentage of heat island to built-up area increased sharply from 11% to 27%. Therefore, it is very important for city managers to estimate and achieve economic benefits of the cooling effect of green spaces. Based on a number of empirical studies and inventory data concerning urban green spaces in Beijing (2009), this study estimates the economic effects of the city′s green space on air temperature reduction through evapotranspiration. The results show that green areas in Beijing could reduce the temperature by 0. 8-4. 8°C. As a consequence, urban green spaces totaling 6. 1 × 104 hm2 in built-up areas of the city could absorb 4. 61×1015 J of heat via evapotranspiration during summer. The average heat absorbed by these spaces could reach 8. 4×108 J· hm-2· d-1, which corresponds to the cooling effect of ten 1000-W air conditioners. According to the price for residential electricity, the summer temperature reduction from the urban green spaces could save 641 million RMB of the cost of electric energy consumption per year. This figure is based on annual average savings reaching 1. 05 RMB/m2 for urban green area with temperature reduction. In addition, the temperature reduction effects of urban green spaces varied with type and location. The amount of heat absorption of protected green zones was significantly less than those of public, roadside, affiliated, and productive green spaces. Average values of air temperature reduction per unit area of green space in Dongcheng District, Xicheng District, Miyun County, and Yanqing County were significantly higher than those of the districts of Pinggu, Fengtai and Shijingshan. These cooling effect variations may be related to differences in area and structure of urban green spaces. Therefore, evidence is provided to support the commitment of resources to urban green infrastructure enhancements. Furthermore, such evidence conveys the importance of the structural characteristics of green land. Urban foresters, ecologists, and landscape planners should take advantage of this type of data to plan, design and manage green spaces in heat island areas. In this way, communities can realize energy savings, and cities and urban neighborhoods can be made more livable.

TI  - Effects Of Lightning And Other Meteorological Factors On Fire Activity In The North American Boreal Forest: Implications For Fire Weather Forecasting
JO  - Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
PY  - 2010
AB  - The effects of lightning and other meteorological factors on wildfire activity in the North American boreal forest are statistically analyzed during the fire seasons of 2000-2006 through an integration of the following data sets: the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 fire products, the 3-hourly 32-km gridded meteorological data from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the lightning data collected by the Canadian Lightning Detection Network (CLDN) and the Alaska Lightning Detection Network (ALDN). Positive anomalies of the 500 hPa geopotential height field, convective available potential energy (CAPE), number of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, and the number of consecutive dry days are found to be statistically important to the seasonal variation of MODIS fire counts in a large portion of Canada and the entirety of Alaska. Analysis of fire occurrence patterns in the eastern and western boreal forest regions shows that dry (in the absence of precipitation) lightning strikes account for only 20% of the total lightning strikes, but are associated with (and likely cause) 40% of the MODIS observed fire counts in these regions. The chance for ignition increases when a threshold of at least 10 dry strikes per NARR grid box and at least 10 consecutive dry days is reached. Due to the orientation of the large-scale pattern, complex differences in fire and lightning occurrence and variability were also found between the eastern and western sub-regions. Locations with a high percentage of dry strikes commonly experience an increased number of fire counts, but the mean number of fire counts per dry strike is more than 50% higher in western boreal forest sub-region, suggesting a geographic and possible topographic influence. While wet lightning events are found to occur with a large range of CAPE values, a high probability for dry lightning occurs only when 500 hPa geopotential heights are above ∼5700 m and CAPE values are near the maximum observed level, underscoring the importance of low-level instability to boreal fire weather forecasts. © Author(s) 2010.

TI  - Intercomparing The Quality Of Recent Reanalyses For Offshore Wind Farm Planning In Germany's Exclusive Economic Zone Of The North Sea
JO  - Advances in Science and Research
PY  - 2023
AB  - In order to facilitate offshore wind farm tenders, Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD, Germany's national meteorological service) provides reanalysis data and quality assessments to Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH, Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency). The regional reanalysis COSMO-REA6 is used besides the global reanalysis ERA5. New reanalyses and derived products getting available are (i) the regional reanalysis CERRA (C3S), (ii) COSMO-R6G2, a successor of COSMO-REA6 which is currently produced by DWD and (iii) HoKliSim-De, a convection-permitting climate simulation for Germany with COSMO-CLM as a regional downscaling of ERA5. In the present study, the quality of the different data sets for offshore wind energy application is compared using in-situ measurements of the wind speed and wind direction from the top anemometer and vane of the FINO1 research platform and satellite-based data of the near-surface wind speed from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF). Evaluation at FINO1 focuses on the time period prior to the installation of nearby wind farms to avoid wake effects. COSMO-REA6, CERRA and HoKliSim-De show only small biases and resemble the observed distribution of the wind speed at FINO1 whereas ERA5 shows slightly lower values of the wind speed at 100gm. All model-based products tend to slightly underestimate the occurrence of south-westerly wind directions and overestimate wind directions from West to Northwest. Smallest directional biases are analysed for COSMO-REA6. Analysis of the windstorm CHRISTIAN suggests that ensemble information is required for the representation of individual extreme events. Evaluation of the near-surface wind speed using satellite-based data is performed for an area around the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea. The median bias of ERA5 and COSMO-REA6 is close to zero. CERRA shows a systematic overestimation of the near-surface wind speed compared to the satellite-based reference datasets. By contrast, a slight underestimation is analysed for HoKliSim-De. The bias distribution analysed for a first simulation stream of COSMO-R6G2 is similar to COSMO-REA6 which provides initial indication for the applicability of the new product. © 2023 Thomas Spangehl et al.

TI  - Assessing Crop Residue Cover Using Shortwave Infrared Reflectance
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2004
AB  - Management of crop residues is an important consideration for reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic carbon. Current methods of measuring residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover over large fields. The objectives of this research were to determine the spectral reflectance of crop residues and soils and to assess the limits of discrimination that can be expected in mixed scenes. Spectral reflectances of dry and wet crop residues plus three diverse soils were measured over the 400-2400 nm wavelength region. Reflectance values for scenes with varying proportions of crop residues and soils were simulated. Additional spectra of scenes with mixtures of crop residues, green vegetation, and soil were also acquired in corn, soybean, and wheat fields with different tillage treatments. The spectra of dry crop residues displayed a broad absorption feature near 2100 nm, associated with cellulose-lignin, that was absent in spectra of soils. Crop residue cover was linearly related (r2=0.89) to the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), which was defined as the relative depth of this absorption feature. Green vegetation cover in the scene attenuated CAI, but was linearly related to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, r2=0.93). A novel method is proposed to assess soil tillage intensity classes using CAI and NDVI. Regional surveys of soil conservation practices that affect soil carbon dynamics may be feasible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Classification And Its Change Detection Using Multi-Temporal Modis Ndvi Data
JO  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
PY  - 2015
AB  - Detailed analysis of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) using remote sensing data in complex irrigated basins provides complete profile for better water resource management and planning. Using remote sensing data, this study provides detailed land use maps of the Lower Chenab Canal irrigated region of Pakistan from 2005 to 2012 for LULC change detection. Major crop types are demarcated by identifying temporal profiles of NDVI using MODIS 250 m x 250 m spatial resolution data. Wheat and rice are found to be major crops in rabi and kharif seasons, respectively. Accuracy assessment of prepared maps is performed using three different techniques: error matrix approach, comparison with ancillary data and with previous study. Producer and user accuracies for each class are calculated along with kappa coefficients (K). The average overall accuracies for rabi and kharif are 82.83\% and 78.21\%, respectively. Producer and user accuracies for individual class range respectively between 72.5\% to 77\% and 70.1\% to 84.3\% for rabi and 76.6\% to 90.2\% and 72\% to 84.7\% for kharif. The K values range between 0.66 to 0.77 for rabi with average of 0.73, and from 0.69 to 0.74 with average of 0.71 for kharif. LULC change detection indicates that wheat and rice have less volatility of change in comparison with. both rabi and kharif fodders. Transformation between cotton and rice is less common due to their completely different cropping conditions. Results of spatial and temporal LULC distributions and their seasonal variations provide useful insights for establishing realistic LULC scenarios for hydrological studies.

TI  - Geo-Climates And Street Developments Shape Urban Tree Characteristics: A Street-View Inventory Analysis Of Over 200,000 Trees Of 11 Metropolises In China
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2024
AB  - Street trees play an important role in the city, but large-scale, multi-city inventory data are very limited to date, which can help to define geo-climatic and social development influences on urban forest characteristics. In this paper we speculate that at national level, geocliamtes and street development shape the different street tree characteristics, and large scale street View images (SVIs)-measurements favor the identification of factors responsible for the street tree variations in China. By collecting urban trees from 11 metropolises through SVIs method, an inventory of urban trees in China, including 201,942 trees at 9807 sites, was obtained from a latitude gradient from tropical 18oN to cold-temperate 45oN. Individual tree size-related growth status, tree-shrub-herb-related vertical structure, tree species identity, and street condition and street development (total 20 social development parameters) in the inventory is recorded. We analyzed trends and factors influencing street trees characteristics through latitudinal variation, distribution, linear regression, redundancy (RDA) ordination, and inter-city comparisons. The results showed that 1) with latitude increased, DBH and CPS linearly decreased, together with more highly dense forests (>100 trees/100 m street segment) observed. Latitude independence was in TH and forest vertical structural complexity. 2) All tree size data were in the log-normal distribution pattern when the two-parameter model was used and was best fitted by the Johnson distribution pattern when the >2-parameter model was used. 3) Tree growth status showed strong latitude dependency (R2 > 0.4, p < 0.05), with latitude increase accompanied by a higher percentage of trees with poor growth status (diebacks, dead trees, etc.). 4) The top abundant trees were Populus spp., Cinnamomum camphora, Salix spp., Platanus acerifolia, Ficus macrocarpa (5.5 %–14.6 %), and the arbor-shrub-herb three-layer structured forests took 52.3 % of total sites. With latitude rise, increasing abundance of Populus spp., Salix spp., elm, and pine but decreasing abundance of the unrecognizable tree groups were found (p < 0.05). 5) We also constructed a street tree comprehensive index based on their potential for providing services to citizen from the inventory data and found it was negatively related to latitudes. RDA ordination showed that geo-climatic conditions (49 %–61.5 %) and social developments (21.4 %–52.7 %) were almost equally responsible for tree size, growth status, and vertical structural variations, while road width (lane number of the street) was the most potent predictor (coefficient > 2.0 %, p < 0.01) for these variations. Our study can benefit the national-level management of urban forests and inventory-based various ecological service precise evaluation. © 2023

TI  - Evaluation Of Land Use Change Degree And Ecological Security In The Manas River Basin, Xinjiang, China
JO  - Russian Journal of Ecology
PY  - 2014
AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the extent of land use change and ecological security grades in the Manas River Basin, on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, from 1989-2002. Surveys were performed using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) means, and the relationship between land use change and ecological security was analyzed. The results are as follows: (i) the degree of land use change steadily increased in the Manas River Basin, and overall land use was in a state of development; (ii) From 1989-2002, the ecological security of the drainage basin generally improved somewhat, but deteriorated subsequently in some regions; (iii) the ecological security grade increased in regions with land use composite change extent values of 18-100, and ecological security grade improved from moderate warning in 1989 to early warning in 2002; and (iv) the cumulative areas of regions with relatively secure, and early-warning ecological security grade were ranked by land use degree in the order, V > IV > I > VI > III > II, showing that that regions with land use degree V (woodlands and grasslands) were important areas for ecological restoration and regeneration in this drainage basin, and that it was difficult to improve the ecological environment on sandy soils. We suggest that ecological security grades can be improved by increasing land use degree in regions where it is low. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

TI  - Forecasting Wildfires In Major Forest Types Of India
JO  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Severity of wildfires witnessed in different parts of the world in the recent times has posed a significant challenge to fire control authorities. Even when the different fire early warning systems have been developed to provide the quickest warnings about the possible wildfire location, severity, and danger, often it is difficult to deploy the resources quickly to contain the wildfire at a short notice. Response time is further delayed when the terrain is complex. Early warning systems based on physics-based models, such as WRF-FIRE/SFIRE, are computationally intensive and require high performance computing resources and significant data related to fuel properties and climate to generate forecasts at short intervals of time (i.e., hourly basis). It is therefore that when the objective is to develop monthly and yearly forecasts, time series models seem to be useful as they require lesser computation power and limited data (as compared to physics-based models). Long duration forecasts are useful in preparing an efficient fire management plan for optimal deployment of resources in the event of forest fire. The present research is aimed at forecasting the number of fires in different forest types of India on a monthly basis using "Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average" time series models (both univariate and with regressors) at 25 km x 25 km spatial resolution (grid) and developing the fire susceptibility maps using Geographical Information System. The performance of models was validated based on the autocorrelation function (ACF), partial ACF, cumulative periodogram, and Portmanteau (L-Jung Box) test. Both the univariate- and regressor-based models performed equally well; however, the univariate model was preferred due to parsimony. The R software package was used to run and test the model. The forecasted active fire counts were tested against the original 3 years monthly forecasts from 2015 to 2017. The variation in coefficient of determination from 0.94 (for year 1 forecast) to 0.64 (when all the 3-year forecasts were considered together) was observed for tropical dry deciduous forests. These values varied from 0.98 to 0.89 for tropical moist deciduous forest and from 0.97 to 0.88 for the tropical evergreen forests. The forecasted active fire counts were used to estimate the future forest fire frequency ratio, which has been used as an indicator of forest fire susceptibility.

TI  - Using Multi-Temporal Modis Ndvi Data To Monitor Tea Status And Forecast Yield: A Case Study At Tanuyen, Laichau, Vietnam
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Tea is a cash crop that improves the quality of life for people in the Tanuyen District of Laichau Province, Vietnam. Tea yield, however, has stagnated in recent years, due to changes in temperature, precipitation, the age of the tea bushes, and diseases. Developing an approach for monitoring tea bushes by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) might be a way to alleviate this problem. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, the paper details an investigation of the changes in tea health and yield forecasting through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we used NDVI as a support tool to demonstrate the temporal and spatial changes in NDVI through the extract tea NDVI value and calculate the mean NDVI value. The results of the study showed that the minimum NDVI value was 0.42 during January 2013 and February 2015 and 2016. The maximum NDVI value was in August 2015 and June 2017. We indicate that the linear relationship between NDVI value and mean temperature was strong with R2 = 0.79 Our results confirm that the combination of meteorological data and NDVI data can achieve a high performance of yield prediction. Three models to predict tea yield were conducted: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the traditional linear regression model (TLRM). For period 2009 to 2018, the prediction tea yield by the RF model was the best with a R2 = 0.73, by SVM it was 0.66, and 0.57 with the TLRM. Three evaluation indicators were used to consider accuracy: the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage error of tea yield (PETY). The highest accuracy for the three models was in 2015 with a R2 ≥ 0.87, RMSE < 50 kg/ha, and PETY less 3% error. In the other years, the prediction accuracy was higher in the SVM and RF models. Meanwhile, the RF algorithm was better than PETY (≤10%) and the root mean square error for this algorithm was significantly less (≤80 kg/ha). RMSE and PETY showed relatively good values in the TLRM model with a RMSE from 80 to 100 kg/ha and a PETY from 8 to 15%. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Vegetation Dynamics Of Sub-Mediterranean Low-Mountain Landscapes Under Climate Change (On The Example Of Southeastern Crimea)
JO  - FORESTS
PY  - 2023
AB  - In the context of a changing environment, understanding the interaction between vegetation and climate is crucial for assessing, predicting, and adapting to future changes in different vegetation types. Vegetation exhibits high sensitivity to external environmental factors, making this understanding particularly significant. This study utilizes geospatial analysis techniques, such as geographic information systems, to investigate vegetation dynamics based on remote sensing data and climatic variables, including annual air temperature, annual precipitation, and annual solar radiation. The research methodology encompasses data collection, processing, and analysis, incorporating multispectral imagery and multilayered maps of various parameters. The calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index serves to evaluate changes in vegetation cover, identify areas experiencing variations in green biomass, and establish strategies for the future development of different vegetation types. During the period from 2001 to 2022, the average normalized difference vegetation index value in the Southeastern Crimea region amounted to 0.443. The highest average values were recorded in the year 2006, reaching a magnitude of 0.469. Conversely, the lowest values were observed in the years 2001-2002, constituting 0.397. It has been ascertained that an overarching positive trend in the evolution of NDVI values from 2001 to 2022 is apparent, thus implying a notable augmentation in vegetative biomass. However, adversarial trends manifest in discrete locales adjacent to the cities of Sudak and Feodosia, along with the coastal stretches of the Black Sea. Correlation analysis is employed to establish relationships between vegetation changes and climatic indicators. The findings contribute to our understanding of the vulnerability of various vegetation types and ecosystems in the Southeastern Crimea region. The obtained data provide valuable insights for the development of sustainable vegetation resource management strategies and climate change adaptation in the region.

TI  - Evaluation Of Water Quality Based On A Machine Learning Algorithm And Water Quality Index For The Ebinur Lake Watershed, China
JO  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
PY  - 2017
AB  - The water quality index (WQI) has been used to identify threats to water quality and to support better water resource management. This study combines a machine learning algorithm, WQI, and remote sensing spectral indices (difference index, DI; ratio index, RI; and normalized difference index, NDI) through fractional derivatives methods and in turn establishes a model for estimating and assessing the WQI. The results show that the calculated WQI values range between 56.61 and 2,886.51. We also explore the relationship between reflectance data and the WQI. The number of bands with correlation coefficients passing a significance test at 0.01 first increases and then decreases with a peak appearing after 1.6 orders. WQI and DI as well as RI and NDI correlation coefficients between optimal band combinations of the peak also appear after 1.6 orders with R-2 values of 0.92, 0.58 and 0.92. Finally, 22 WQI estimation models were established by POS-SVR to compare the predictive effects of these models. The models based on a spectral index of 1.6 were found to perform much better than the others, with an R-2 of 0.92, an RMSE of 58.4, and an RPD of 2.81 and a slope of curve fitting of 0.97.

TI  - Remote Active Monitoring In Patients With Heart Failure (Rapid-Rf): Design And Rationale
JO  - Journal of Cardiac Failure
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) ambulatory disease management programs appear to offer the greatest benefit to HF patients at highest risk, defined as having New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III or IV symptoms. The Latitude Patient Management System is the first HF management tool to use wireless telemetry present in a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device that is linked to remotely collect blood pressure and weight measures, permitting a single transmission reporting device data. Potential advantages of this system include ease of data transmissions, correlation among measures of HF status, arrhythmic events, and device performance. However, the use and ultimate utility of these combined features for patient management are untested. Methods and Results: The Remote Active Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure (RAPID-RF) study is a multicenter registry that will enroll up to 1000 patients on the Latitude Patient Management System from approximately 100 centers. The primary objective is to examine physician responses to Latitude Active Monitoring data alerts by assessing alert-related medical interventions. Minimum follow-up will be 3 months after implant with a maximum follow-up time of 24 months after implant. Conclusions: The RAPID-RF study will provide important preliminary data on how remotely collected HF and arrhythmic surveillance data alter the management of HF patients with CRT-D devices. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Sub-Regional Groundwater Storage Recovery In North China Plain After The South-To-North Water Diversion Project
JO  - Journal of Hydrology
PY  - 2021
AB  - The South-to-North water diversion Middle Route Project (MRP) is expected to alleviate the long-term groundwater storage (GWS) depletion in North China Plain (NCP) after the beginning of its operation in December 2014. This study aims to investigate the effect of MRP on GWS by comparing GWS changes before (2003–2014) and after (2015–2018) the MRP operation. The analysis was conducted by using groundwater level data from 617 wells in NCP, and then evaluated against satellite-based water storage data from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On missions. On average in NCP, a decreasing trend of −19.1 ± 5.1 mm/yr was seen in GWS based on well observations during 2003–2014, but a recovery trend of +1.8 ± 0.7 mm/yr was found during 2015–2018. The GWS recovery was most prominent in subregions where groundwater over-utilization had occurred in NCP. GRACE exhibited the capacity to detect the regional GWS depletion during 2003–2014, but difficult to distinguish the sub-regional GWS recovery during 2015–2018. The potential causes for GWS recovery were found to be complicated, not only caused by the reduction of groundwater pumping as accelerated by MRP-diverted water, but also the increasing precipitation recharge of aquifers and the enhanced management of groundwater system. The findings highlight that GWS in NCP has started a gradual transition from unsustainable depletion to sub-regional recovery as benefit from the MRP water diversion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparative Assessment Of Satellite Images Spectral Characteristics In Identifying The Different Levels Of Soil Salinization Using Machine Learning Techniques In Google Earth Engine
JO  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Assessing salt-affected land (SAL) remains a major challenge worldwide, especially in developing countries due to limited data availability. The development of remote sensing (RS) digital satellite data and their spectral characteristics pave the way to assess soil salinity. A comparative assessment has been carried out between two different spatial resolution satellite images to find out the most suitable satellite image for assessing soil salinity. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data of 2020 were imported from Google Earth Engine (GEE) data catalog. Spectral indices of vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices, Enhanced Vegetation Indices, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices, Generalized Difference Vegetation Index) and soil salinity (Normalized Difference Salinity Index, Canopy Response Salinity Index, Salinity Index (SI), SI-I, SI-II, SI-III, Salinity index 1 (SI1), SI2, SI3, SI4, SI5) were calculated. The Random Forest model was used for the analysis. Collected soil samples' electrical conductivity values were used to train and validate the model. 70\% of the soil samples were used for model training and 30\% for validation. The result shows Sentinel-2 is more capable of detecting saline soil regions compared to Landsat-8. Based on 5-fold cross-validation, the overall accuracy of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 were assessed as 98.31\% and 97.19\%. The total SAL area using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were 12,446 ha and 13,225 ha respectively. The study showed the effectiveness of RS techniques to detect the SALs in different spatial resolutions, which can help to evaluate unproductive land and its management at the state or regional level for the creation of alternative livelihood options.

TI  - Development Of Flood-Hazard-Mapping Model Using Random Forest And Frequency Ratio In Sumedang Regency, West Java, Indonesia
JO  - Geomatics and Environmental Engineering
PY  - 2023
AB  - Flooding, often triggered by heavy rainfall, is a common natural disaster in Indonesia, and is the third most common type of disaster in Sumedang Regency. Hence, flood-susceptibility mapping is essential for flood management. The primary challenge in this lies in the complex, non-linear relationships between indices and risk levels. To address this, the application of random forest (RF) and frequency ratio (FR) methods has been explored. Ten flood-conditioning factors were determined from the references: the distance from a river, elevation, geology, geomorphology, lithology, land use/land cover, rainfall, slope, soil type, and topographic wetness index (TWI). The 35 flood locations from the flood-inventory map were selected, and the remaining 18 flood locations were used for justifying the outcomes. The flooded areas from the RF model were 28.39%; the rest (71.61%) were non-flooded areas. Also, the flooded areas from the FR method were 8.02%, and the non-flooded areas were 91.98%. The AUC for both methods was a similar value – 83.0%. This result is quite accurate and can be used by policymakers to prevent and manage future flooding in the Sumedang area. These results can also be used as materials for updating existing flood-susceptibility maps. © 2023 Author(s).

TI  - Land Fragmentation And Variation Of Ecosystem Services In The Context Of Rapid Urbanization: The Case Of Taizhou City, China
JO  - Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment
PY  - 2014
AB  - This study analyzes land use dynamics, land fragmentation, variation of ecosystem service value (ESV), and the underlying driving forces in the context of rapid urbanization in Taizhou city, China. An integrated approach utilizing geographic information system and remote sensing was used to analyze land use/land cover change, spatiotemporal patterns of land fragmentation and variation of ESV over the period of 1995-2010. The results show that the areal extent of built-up land increased by 3.72 times, whereas loss of the cropland, forest, and fallow land accounted for 18.52, 34.80, and 28.94 % of the new built-up land, respectively. As observed, in-filling of the major traffic road networks and axis-based expansion of built-up land occurred. Outward expansion of the built-up land, in particular, indicated that human encroachment into surrounding natural and semi-natural ecosystems leading to decreased total ecosystem service functions of the study area. As a whole, significant change in key landscape, especially a net decrease in forest, and remarkable socioeconomic development should be responsible for an overall decline in 36.29 % of total ESV during the recently rapid urbanization process. Therefore, sustainable development policies should address the decline of ESV. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Feature Fusion-Based Cpcnn-Ml In Lantau Island, Hong Kong
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is an effective way to predict spatial probability of landslide occurrence. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods apply self-built CNN with simple structure, which failed to reach CNN's full potential on high-level feature extraction, meanwhile ignored the use of numerical predisposing factors. For the purpose of exploring feature fusion based CNN models with greater reliability in LSM, this study proposes an ensemble model based on channel-expanded pre-trained CNN and traditional machine learning model (CPCNN-ML). In CPCNN-ML, pre-trained CNN with mature structure is modified to excavate high-level features of multichannel predisposing factor layers. LSM result is generated by traditional machine learning (ML) model based on hybrid feature of high-level features and numerical predisposing factors. Lantau Island, Hong Kong is selected as study area; temporal landslide inventory is used for model training and evaluation. Experimental results show that CPCNN-ML has ability to predict landslide occurrence with high reliability, especially the CPCNN-ML based on random forest. Contrast experiments with self-built CNN and traditional ML models further embody the superiority of CPCNN-ML. It is worth noting that coastal regions are newly identified landslide-prone regions compared with previous research. This finding is of great reference value for Hong Kong authorities to formulate appropriate disaster prevention and mitigation policies. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2005
AB  - The problem of many cities in Europe with the new limit values of PM10 of the Directive 1999/30/EC and the discussion about the implementation of PM2.5 monitoring measurements is leading to discuss also about the spatial distribution of PM concentrations. The general objective of ICAROS NET is the development and demonstration of a networked interactive computational environment that allows the integration and fusion of environmental information from remote sensing observations, ground air quality measurements, and pollution transport models in order to minimize uncertainty in decision-making regarding operational air pollution control and abatement. The method of the platform and some results of the ICAROS NET campaigns were described already in the paper SPIE 5571-38. In the case of Munich it was possible to integrate, besides the PM10 concentration determination, the evaluation of PM2.5 and PM 1 concentrations. Because of the weather conditions (clouds) and the general problem of permanent background aerosol in the area of Bavaria it was difficult to find out a good clear satellite reference image for the platform. Therefore, background aerosol (urban, suburban and rural) is added. The growth of the particles with a rising relative humidity is considered in the first layer data fusion module. Finally, PM concentrations of new satellite images and results of the ICAROS NET platform are presented and evaluated.

TI  - A Comparison Of Simulated And Field-Derived Leaf Area Index (Lai) And Canopy Height Values From Four Forest Complexes In The Southeastern Usa
JO  - FORESTS
PY  - 2018
AB  - Vegetative leaf area is a critical input to models that simulate human and ecosystem exposure to atmospheric pollutants. Leaf area index (LAI) can be measured in the field or numerically simulated, but all contain some inherent uncertainty that is passed to the exposure assessments that use them. LAI estimates for minimally managed or natural forest stands can be particularly difficult to develop as a result of interspecies competition, age and spatial distribution. Satellite-based LAI estimates hold promise for retrospective analyses, but we must continue to rely on numerical models for alternative management analysis. Our objective for this study is to calculate and validate LAI estimates generated from the USDA Environmental Policy Impact Climate (EPIC) model (a widely used, field-scale, biogeochemical model) on four forest complexes spanning three physiographic provinces in Virginia and North Carolina. Measurements of forest composition (species and number), LAI, tree diameter, basal area, and canopy height were recorded at each site during the 2002 field season. Calibrated EPIC results show stand-level temporally resolved LAI estimates with R-2 values ranging from 0.69 to 0.96, and stand maximum height estimates within 20\% of observation. This relatively high level of performance is attributable to EPIC's approach to the characterization of forest stand biogeochemical budgets, stand history, interspecies competition and species-specific response to local weather conditions. We close by illustrating the extension of this site-level approach to scales that could support regional air quality model simulations.

TI  - Revisiting The Environmental Kuznets Curve For City-Level Co<Sub>2</Sub> Emissions: Based On Corrected Npp-Viirs Nighttime Light Data In China
JO  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
PY  - 2020
AB  - With the increasing trend of global warming, the Chinese government faces tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R-2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers. This study could be considered the first to simulate CO2 emissions at the provincial and city levels in China based on a NPP-VIIRS nighttime light model to explore the associated geographical distribution characteristics and potential influencing factors.

TI  - Biochar Enhances The Capacity Of Climate-Smart Agriculture To Mitigate Climate Change
JO  - Handbook of Climate Change Management: Research, Leadership, Transformation
PY  - 2021
AB  - Climate change is likely to have dire effects on biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and production stability among resource-poor African farmers. The reliance on rainfall for food production increases smallholder farmer’s risk to the effects of climate change due to their low capacity for adaptation. Climate change affects the livelihood and food security of smallholder farmers by increasing global temperatures and reducing the frequency and predictability of precipitation, which creates huge abiotic stresses during crop production. Moreover, the traditional farming practices have not focused on the soil as a resource which has created an environment that encourages soil degradation, hence the recent drive towards adoption of climate smart technologies as a solution. While climate-smart agriculture (CSA) strategies such as conservation agriculture, which increase farmers’ capacity to adapt and mitigate climate change effects, have been widely researched on and recommended, adoption of all the three pillars has mostly been low among African smallholder farmers. Farmers often fail to embrace residue retention as an integral component of the technology due to competing uses of the crop residues. Questions that arise therefore include: What happens if farmers manage crop residues differently in farming systems? Will it help farmers to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects? Biochar could play a role in sustainable intensification and climate-smart agriculture, through its potential in strengthening the resilience of smallholder farmers agricultural systems. Our chapter highlights current research and potential benefits of the biochar technology as a residue management strategy under CSA practices, which creates a win-win situation on crop-livestock farming setup. Research on the benefits of converting crop residues into a carbon-stable compound, biochar, is also presented, highlighting areas requiring future research in the African context. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Carbon Stocks Of A Forest Affected By Mountain Pine Beetle In Idaho Using Lidar And Multispectral Imagery
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2012
AB  - Mountain pine beetle outbreaks have caused widespread tree mortality in North American forests in recent decades, yet few studies have documented impacts on carbon cycling. In particular, landscape scales intermediate between stands and regions have not been well studied. Remote sensing is an effective tool for quantifying impacts of insect outbreaks on forest ecosystems at landscape scales. In this study, we developed and evaluated methodologies for quantifying aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks affected by mountain pine beetle using field observations, lidar data, and multispectral imagery. We evaluated methods at two scales, the plot level and the tree level, to ascertain the capability of each for mapping AGC impacts of bark beetle infestation across a forested landscape. In 27 plots across our 5054-ha study area in central Idaho, we measured tree locations, health, diameter, height, and other relevant attributes. We used allometric equations to estimate AGC content of individual trees and, in turn, summed tree AGC estimates to the plot level. Tree-level and plot-level AGC were then predicted from lidar metrics using separate statistical models. At the tree level, cross-validated additive models explained 50-54% of the variation in tree AGC (root mean square error (RMSE) values of 26-42. kg AGC, or 32-48%). At the plot level, a cross-validated linear model explained 84% of the variation in plot AGC (RMSE of 9.2. Mg AGC/ha, or 12%). To map beetle-caused tree mortality, we classified high-resolution digital aerial photography into green, red, and gray tree classes with an overall accuracy of 87% (kappa = 0.79) compared with our field observations. We then combined the multispectral classification with lidar-derived AGC estimates to quantify the amount of AGC within beetle-killed trees at the field plots. Errors in classification, apparent tree lean caused by off-nadir aerial imagery, and a bias between percent cover and percent AGC reduced accuracy when combining multispectral and lidar products. Plot-level models estimated total plot AGC more accurately than tree-level models summed for plots as determined by RMSE (9.2 versus 21. Mg AGC/ha, respectively) and mean bias error (0.52 versus -6.7. Mg AGC/ha, respectively). When considering individual tree classes (green, red, gray) summed for plots, comparisons of plot-level and tree-level methods exhibited mixed results, with some accuracy measures higher for plot-level models. Despite a lack of clear improvement in tree-level models, we suggest that tree-level models should be considered for assessing situations with high spatial variability such as beetle outbreaks, especially if apparent tree lean effects can be minimized such as through the use of satellite imagery. Our methods illustrate the utility of combining lidar and multispectral imagery and can guide decisions about spatial resolution of analysis for understanding and documenting impacts of these forest disturbances. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

TI  - Environmental Consideration In Railway Route Selection With Gis (Case Study:rasht-Anzali Railway In Iran)
JO  - Journal of Environmental Studies
PY  - 2008
AB  - In order to minimize environmental impacts and to achieve sustainable development in route construction projects, environmental parameters must be considered. To achieve this goal, use of geographic information system for route selection was proposed. This research was undertaken for Rasht-Anzali railway in north of Iran as a case study. At first, environmental parameters that affect railway route selection were identified. These parameters include slope, geology, soil, land cover, rivers, roads and cultural heritage. Data related to these parameters were gathered or in some cases produced. Slope, rivers and road map produced from digital topographical map, at the scale of 1:25000. Landover map was produced from landsat7 ETM+ data dated on May 2000. Rectification of satellite data was implemented using ground control points method. To achieve a better resolution the multispectral bands were fused with ETM-Pan. Image classification was performed using a new approach (digital and visual). Maps such as geology, soil and cultural heritage were digitized. In order to determine the relative importance of these parameters in route selection, environmental and civil experts' views collected from a questionnaire that has been designed for this aim. These views were used in pair wise comparison method to determine weight of map layers that related to these parameters. These weighted layers overlaid and a friction map was produced and automatically 4 routs resulted in GIS. Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to determine optimum routes in comparison with that produced in traditional method. Results indicate that the routes, which were designed using GIS method, are more environmentally sound than traditional one and represent a significant benefit for the decision maker. According to results of this investigation, applying GIS technology and inclusion of environmental experts views are recommended to minimize environmental liabilities.

TI  - Integration Of Sentinel-2 Derived Spectral Indices And In-Situ Forest Inventory To Predict Forest Biomass
JO  - Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research Series A: Physical Sciences
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest biomass estimation is the central part of sustainable forest management to assess carbon stocks and carbon emissions from forest ecosystem. Sentinel-2 is state-of-art sensor with refined spatial and recurrent temporal resolution data. The present study explored the potential of Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices for above ground biomass prediction using four regression models (linear, exponential, power and logarithmic). Sentinel-2 indices includes Global environmental monitoring index, transformed normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, normalized difference infrared index and red-edge normalized difference vegetation index. The performances of Sentinel-2 indices were assessed by simple single variable (index) based regression for GEMI, TNDVI, NDII, NDWI and RENDVI versus AGB values. Further, stepwise linear regression was also developed in which used all indices entered into stepwise selection and the best index was selected in the final model. Results showed that linear model of all indices performance best compared to the rest three models and R2 values 0.12, 0.39, 0.46, 0.44 and 0.37 for Global environmental monitoring index, transformed normalized. Vegetation index, normalized difference water index, infrared index and red-edge vegetation index, respectively. Normalized difference water index was considered the best index among five computed indices in simple linear as well as in stepwise linear regression, whereas rest of the indices were removed because they were not significant under the stepwise criteria. Further, the accuracy of normalized difference water index model was determined by root mean square error and final prediction model has 28.27 t/ha error for both simple linear and stepwise linear regression. Therefore, normalized difference water index was selected for biomass mapping and resultant biomass showed up to 339 t/ha in the study area. The resultant biomass map also showed consistency with global datasets which include global forest canopy height and global forest tree cover change maps. The study suggest that Sentinel-2 product has great potential to estimate above ground biomass with accuracy and can be used for large scale mapping in combination with national forest inventory for carbon emission accounting. © 2021 PCSIR-Scientific Information Centre.

TI  - Road User Charging: From Policies To Technologies
JO  - 14th World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems, ITS 2007
PY  - 2007
AB  - Up to 5 years ago, the mainstream technology for electronic toll collection was Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and its near relation, Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI). Schemes based on these formed the backbone of national charging systems in Europe, North and South Americas and South East Asia. Standards were publicly available and these technologies were considered to be a safe solution for tolling. Europe and North America had already deployed regional interoperable schemes, including the Inter Agency Group's EZ-Pass in the North East of the US and Télépeage Inter-Société (TIS) in France. However, the fiscal and economic policies that once supported tolls have also evolved: the decline in revenues from gas tax, increased vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and the unchecked rise in congestion in cities are forcing governments to rethink how we should be charged for road usage. Road User Charging (RUC) is now firmly on the public agenda. National governments and highway operators are now faced with the broadest possible choice of technology options including: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems, Electronic Vehicle Identification (EVI), the humble odometer and, the emergence of the electronic tachograph. Enforcement regimes now depend on image-based evidential capture rather than barriers. Toll plazas are also being replaced by Open Road Tolling (ORT) and Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) solutions. New, emerging policies are identified based on international precedence and suggests that the traditional approach to technology selection will need to adapt accordingly. An emerging policy shift towards distance-based charging with charges differentiated by road type and location is well-matched with the capability of GNSS. The continuing use of point charging schemes (i.e. charges to use 'conventional' toll roads) suggests that DSRC-type functionality will remain desirable. Operationally, the current preference towards separately developed, verticallyintegrated schemes does not recognise the benefits of the economies of scale that could be realised through facility sharing, cooperative procurements pr procurements based on a common set of rules and common legislation for enforcement. The paper concludes with a critical analysis of emerging policy trends, the resulting challenges facing current and future scheme operators and the future direction of technology evolution to enable policy trends.

TI  - Feature Weighted Attention—Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Model For Change Detection In Remote Sensing Images
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - In remote sensing images, change detection (CD) is required in many applications, such as: resource management, urban expansion research, land management, and disaster assessment. Various deep learning-based methods were applied to satellite image analysis for change detection, yet many of them have limitations, including the overfitting problem. This research proposes the Feature Weighted Attention (FWA) in Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) method to reduce the overfitting problem and increase the performance of classification in change detection applications. Additionally, data usage and accuracy in remote sensing activities, particularly CD, can be significantly improved by a large number of training models based on BiLSTM. Normalization techniques are applied to input images in order to enhance the quality and reduce the difference in pixel value. The AlexNet and VGG16 models were used to extract useful features from the normalized images. The extracted features were then applied to the FWA-BiLSTM model, to give more weight to the unique features and increase the efficiency of classification. The attention layer selects the unique features that help to distinguish the changes in the remote sensing images. From the experimental results, it was clearly shown that the proposed FWA-BiLSTM model achieved better performance in terms of precision (93.43%), recall (93.16%), and overall accuracy (99.26%), when compared with the existing Difference-enhancement Dense-attention Convolutional Neural Network (DDCNN) model. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - The El Cielo Biosphere Reserve: Forest Cover Changes And Conservation Attitudes In An Important Neotropical Region
JO  - Professional Geographer
PY  - 2014
AB  - This article combines approaches to better understand both forest cover changes and attitudes toward environmental conservation in the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in northeastern Mexico. Satellite images are used to document the extent and response of forest cover in the reserve before and after its designation as a biosphere reserve. Ethnographic interviews are also employed to examine the attitudes of local people toward the costs and benefits of the biosphere reserve in their lives. Our research found that unlike many "paper parks," large-scale deforestation has stopped and forest cover has expanded after the biosphere reserve was created. Our research also found that local people value both tangible and intangible benefits created by the biosphere reserve. © 2014 by Association of American Geographers.

TI  - Canopy Detection Over Roads Using Mobile Lidar Data
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - A high percentage of forest fires take place around roads. These infrastructures provide an escape route for the population in case of fire. Optimization of forest management in the surroundings of roads is a necessary task in terms of wildfires prevention and mitigation of their effects. Therefore, it is essential to avoid the horizontal continuity of vegetation across roads. A methodology for the measurement of canopy area over roads is developed and based on mobile LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds. The acquisition of LiDAR data is done by Lynx Mobile Mapper System from the University of Vigo. The methodology is automated using LiDAR data processing (M-estimator Sample Consensus and near neighbour algorithms) and image processing techniques (rasterization and binarization). The developed algorithms are tested on a study area, the DP-3606 road (Spain). Results are compared with ground truth data of the canopy projected on the road. The best obtained results present a mean geometric error of 2.82% for 0.25 m resolution and 104.02% for 2 m resolution. Furthermore, the higher the pixel size, the greater the error was obtained with a linear correlation value of 0.99. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Sentinel Node Status Prediction By Four Statistical Models: Results From A Large Bi-Institutional Series (N = 1132)
JO  - Annals of Surgery
PY  - 2009
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) in patients with cutaneous melanoma using statistical models predicting SN status. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: About 80% of patients currently undergoing SNB are node negative. In the absence of conclusive evidence of a SNB-associated survival benefit, these patients may be over-treated. Here, we tested the efficiency of 4 different models in predicting SN status. METHODS:: The clinicopathologic data (age, gender, tumor thickness, Clark level, regression, ulceration, histologic subtype, and mitotic index) of 1132 melanoma patients who had undergone SNB at institutions in Italy and Australia were analyzed. Logistic regression, classification tree, random forest, and support vector machine models were fitted to the data. The predictive models were built with the aim of maximizing the negative predictive value (NPV) and reducing the rate of SNB procedures though minimizing the error rate. RESULTS:: After cross-validation logistic regression, classification tree, random forest, and support vector machine predictive models obtained clinically relevant NPV (93.6%, 94.0%, 97.1%, and 93.0%, respectively), SNB reduction (27.5%, 29.8%, 18.2%, and 30.1%, respectively), and error rates (1.8%, 1.8%, 0.5%, and 2.1%, respectively). DISCUSSION:: Using commonly available clinicopathologic variables, predictive models can preoperatively identify a proportion of patients (∼25%) who might be spared SNB, with an acceptable (1%-2%) error. If validated in large prospective series, these models might be implemented in the clinical setting for improved patient selection, which ultimately would lead to better quality of life for patients and optimization of resource allocation for the health care system. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TI  - Daily Co2 Emission Reduction Indicates The Control Of Activities To Contain Covid-19 In China
JO  - Innovation
PY  - 2020
AB  - Lockdown measures are essential to containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but they will slow down economic growth by reducing industrial and commercial activities. However, the benefits of activity control from containing the pandemic have not been examined and assessed. Here we use daily carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction in China estimated from statistical data for energy consumption and satellite data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) as an indicator for reduced activities consecutive to a lockdown. We perform a correlation analysis to show that a 1% day−1 decrease in the rate of COVID-19 cases is associated with a reduction in daily CO2 emissions of 0.22% ± 0.02% using statistical data for energy consumption relative to emissions without COVID-19, or 0.20% ± 0.02% using satellite data for atmospheric column NO2. We estimate that swift action in China is effective in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases <100,000 with a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 23% by the end of February 2020, whereas a 1-week delay would have required greater containment and a doubling of the emission reduction to meet the same goal. By analyzing the costs of health care and fatalities, we find that the benefits on public health due to reduced activities in China are 10-fold larger than the loss of gross domestic product. Our findings suggest an unprecedentedly high cost of maintaining activities and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and stress substantial benefits of containment in public health by taking early actions to reduce activities during the outbreak of COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Map-Based Variable-Rate Manure Application In Wheat Using A Data Fusion Approach
JO  - SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Poor manure management practices lead to excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in soils that are still common in many countries in Europe. One way to optimize the economic returns and at the same time minimize the environmental impacts of poor manure management is by Variable Rate Manure (VRM) application. This work aimed at the evaluation of potential economic benefits of VRM application, compared to Uniform Rate Manure (URM) application, using advanced sensing, modeling and control technologies. Soil fertility attributes were measured using an on-line visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy sensor, and crop normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was retrieved from Sentinel-2 images in a field of 8 ha with wheat in Flanders, Belgium. The predicted soil properties and the crop NDVI were clustered into a four-class fertility map using the k-mean clustering, each of which has different fertility level. The fertility map was overlaid by parallel strips representing URM, VRM1 and VRM2 treatments. VRM1 intended to apply 40 \% more manure than URM to high fertility zones, 20 \% more to medium-high fertility zones, 20 \% less to medium-low fertility zones, and 40 \% less to low fertility zones, whereas VRM2 adopted the opposite approach to that of VRM1. Results showed that VRM2 had increased crop yield by 1.5 \% (0.19 t/ha), but reduced applied N by 4.1 \% (11.01 kg/ha) and P by 7.1 \% (3.72 kg/ha), compared to URM. The VRM1 approach consumed extra N of 5.21 kg/ha (1.8 \%) and extra P of 1.63 kg/ha (3.1 \%), to achieve a yield increase of 0.31 t/ha with a profit of 40.06 EUR/ha (2.1 \%), compared to URM. However, a slightly smaller profit of VRM2 of 36.32 EUR/ha was calculated. Although VRM1 was more profitable than VRM2 by 0.2 \% (3.74 EUR/ha), the latter is recommended as the best approach, as VRM1 increased environmental risks in the sense of increasing both N and P applied, by 5.9 \% (17.12 kg/ha) and 10.4 \% (5.35 kg/ha), respectively.

TI  - Ecological And Environmental Effects Of Land Use Change In Rapid Urbanization: The Case Of Hangzhou, China
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2017
AB  - Land use changes sharply under rapid urbanization, yet its ecological and environmental effects are often neglected in land use decisions. Using the case of Hangzhou, China, we analyze the ecological and environmental effects of land use changes, including ecosystem services value (ESV) and carbon emissions, based on Landsat TM images from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014. We found significant ecological and environmental effects of land use changes under rapid urbanization. The value of ecosystem services in Hangzhou decreased from 546.7 million USD in 1995 to 448.97 million USD in 2014, and the ratio of ESV to GDP decreased from 5.8% to 0.6%. The net carbon emissions associated with land use changes increased from 4.26 million tons in 1995 to 15.10 million tons in 2014, mainly due to the increase of built-up land carbon emissions and the decrease of forest land carbon sink. The ESV is unevenly distributed spatially and low ESV spread from the central to the peripheral area. We use scenario analysis to illustrate that economic growth and environmental protection could be coordinated by bringing ecological and environmental effects into land use decisions. © 2017

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy For Melanoma And Other Melanocytic Tumors In Adolescents
JO  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
PY  - 2005
AB  - Background/Purpose: Melanoma is rare, accounting for only 1\% of all pediatric malignancies. The management of pediatric melanoma is controversial but largely parallels that of an adult occurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBX) has become a standard of care for adults with melanoma, but the role of this procedure in the staging of pediatric patients remains to be established. The goal of this study was to determine outcomes and complications of children and adolescent patients undergoing SLNBX at the authors' institution. Methods: A retrospective review of patients younger than 21 years (N = 20) undergoing SLNBX for melanoma or other melanocytic skin lesions at the University of Colorado Health Science Center between 1996 and 2003 was conducted. Results: Sentinel lymph node biopsy was successful in all 20 patients, and 8 patients (40\%) were found to have metastases within the sentinel node. As in adults, the sentinel node status correlates with primary tumor depth. No complications occurred in patients undergoing SLNBX, but 4 clinically significant complications (57\%) occurred in the 7 patients undergoing a completion lymph node dissection. At 33 months median follow-up, all patients were disease free. Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be successfully and safely performed in pediatric patients for melanoma and atypical nevi. However, the prognostic information and therapeutic implications of SLNBX results for children and adolescents remain unclear. Completion lymph node dissection for microscopic disease is a morbid procedure with uncertain benefit to pediatric or adult patients with a positive SLNBX result. Long-term follow-up data are needed before SLNBX can become a standard of care in pediatric melanoma or as a diagnostic tool to distinguish the atypical Spitz nevus from melanoma.

TI  - A Numerical Testbed For Remote Sensing Of Aerosols, And Its Demonstration For Evaluating Retrieval Synergy From A Geostationary Satellite Constellation Of Geo-Cape And Goes-R
JO  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY \& RADIATIVE TRANSFER
PY  - 2014
AB  - We present a numerical testbed for remote sensing of aerosols, together with a demonstration for evaluating retrieval synergy from a geostationary satellite constellation. The testbed combines inverse (optimal-estimation) software with a forward model containing linearized code for computing particle scattering (for both spherical and non-spherical particles), a kernel-based (land and ocean) surface bi-directional reflectance facility, and a linearized radiative transfer model for polarized radiance. Calculation of gas absorption spectra uses the HITRAN (High-resolution TRANsmission molecular absorption) database of spectroscopic line parameters and other trace species cross-sections. The outputs of the testbed include not only the Stokes 4-vector elements and their sensitivities (Jacobians) with respect to the aerosol single scattering and physical parameters (such as size and shape parameters, refractive index, and plume height), but also DFS (Degree of Freedom for Signal) values for retrieval of these parameters. This testbed can be used as a tool to provide an objective assessment of aerosol information content that can be retrieved for any constellation of (planned or real) satellite sensors and for any combination of algorithm design factors (in terms of wavelengths, viewing angles, radiance and/or polarization to be measured or used). We summarize the components of the testbed, including the derivation and validation of analytical formulae for Jacobian calculations. Benchmark calculations from the forward model are documented. In the context of NASA's Decadal Survey Mission GEO-CAPE (GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events), we demonstrate the use of the testbed to conduct a feasibility study of using polarization measurements in and around the O-2 A band for the retrieval of aerosol height information from space, as well as an to assess potential improvement in the retrieval of aerosol fine and coarse mode aerosol optical depth (AOD) through the synergic use of two future geostationary satellites, GOES-R (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series) and TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution). Strong synergy between GEOS-R and TEMPO are found especially in their characterization of surface bi-directional reflectance, and thereby, can potentially improve the AOD retrieval to the accuracy required by GEO-CAPE.

AB  - The paper has comparatively analyzed the role of tourism in the economic growth of Bulgaria and Romania, using the specific system of indicators: GDP, employment, multiplicator effect, efficiency, investments, visitor exports, and competitiveness. The methodology was based on the formulas provided by literature at present and the data were collected from UNWTO Data Base. Bulgaria and Romania are important tourism destinations grace to their rich cultural and historical heritage, beautiful landscapes, landmarks, tourism forms, service quality and hospitality. Bulgaria has more visitors and receipts than Romania, but in absolute value, tourism has a higher contribution to GDP in Romania, while in relative value, 11.5 \% of GDP is produced by tourism and in Romania just 5.3 \%. Tourism supports employment 3.7 times better in Romania than in Bulgaria regarding the number of jobs. The multiplicator effect is almost similar in the both countries, proving that tourism growth stimulated the development of other economic sectors. Tourism increases labor productivity in the economy of the both countries, but 1.4 times more in Bulgaria. Visitor exports in Bulgaria are higher than in Romania, while investments in tourism are 4.5 higher in Romania than in Bulgaria. Tourism competitiveness is low in the both countries, but Bulgaria comes on a lower position than Romania in the international market. As a conclusion, both Bulgaria and Romania has to intensify the efforts to sustain tourism growth, its contribution to the development of the economy and become a more competitive sector. Bulgaria and Romania have to better evaluate all their resources, to diversify their offers, to improve service quality and increase tourism performance. Only in this way, a new tourism strategy could attract more visitors and increase the role of tourism in the economy and improve the image of each country in Europe and in the world.

TI  - Applying Deep-Learning Enhanced Fusion Methods For Improved Ndvi Reconstruction And Long-Term Vegetation Cover Study: A Case Of The Danjiang River Basin
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an essential metric in vegetation monitoring for remote sensing applications. While there are numerous long-term low-resolution NDVI datasets available there remains an unmet need for high-resolution NDVI reconstructions over extended time frames. Existing research has not comprehensively assessed the efficacy of various temporal fusion techniques for NDVI reconstruction at large regional scales. Traditional Spatiotemporal Image Fusion (TSTIF) methods often suffer from limited fusion accuracy due to input data quality constraints. To address these limitations this study introduces an innovative Deep Learning-Enhanced Spatiotemporal Fusion Method. Deep learning algorithms are employed to refine the spatial resolution of input data thereby facilitating the separation of complex image elements located at feature boundaries. This improved approach significantly enhances fusion accuracy as validated against five established TSTIF techniques through empirical analysis. As a case study we generate long-term Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) datasets to investigate the ecological dynamics of the Danjiang River Basin. Our findings reveal substantial gains in NDVI reconstruction accuracy through the incorporation of deep learning into traditional fusion techniques. Among the methods tested the STRUM algorithm showed the greatest improvement with its R2 value increasing from 0.872 to 0.894 and a consistent reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The FSDAF technique emerged as the most effective boasting an R2 value of 0.953 and an RMSE of 0.012. These enhanced NDVI datasets provide more accurate representations of the basin's vegetation cover thus enriching long-term observational archives and facilitating further quantitative remote sensing analyses. Moreover we report a 21-year mean FVC of 0.702 for the Danjiang River Basin characterized by a “north-high south-low” distribution that varies seasonally. Improvements in vegetation cover were observed in Xichuan and Neixiang counties while environmental degradation is evident in the broader Danjiang River watershed. Key factors influencing these spatial variations include elevation and soil composition in addition to climate variables such as rainfall and temperature. Infrastructure projects like the South-to-North Water Diversion Project and targeted ecological conservation policies have also positively impacted vegetation within the basin. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Linking Geomorphologic Knowledge, Rs And Gis Techniques For Analyzing Land Cover And Land Use Change: A Multitemporal Study In The Cointzio Watershed, Mexico
JO  - Revista Ambiente e Agua
PY  - 2013
AB  - It is well-established that changes in land cover and land use (LCLU) are relevant to current local and global changes that are directly linked with food security, human health, urbanization, biodiversity, trans-border migration, environmental refuges, water and soil quality, runoff and sedimentation rates, and other processes. This paper examines LCLU change processes within the Cointzio watershed (Central Mexico). The analysis covers a 28-year time period from 1975 to 2003. LCLU changes were deduced from multi-temporal remote sensing analyses (1975, 1986, 1996, 2000 and 2003). Nearly all of the LCLU changes experienced in the Cointzio watershed occurred during the 1986-1996 period. Half of the 665 km2 of the watershed have changed during this period, in what corresponds to a ten-fold increase in the rate of change as compared to the 1975-1986 and 1996-2003 periods. These massive changes are probably related to the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which limited the transit of undocumented Mexican workers to the United States of America. The methodology applied in this research constitutes a low-cost alternative for evaluating the impact of LCLU change in watersheds. The magnitude of land use change differed during the periods of analyses in the watershed, functional zones and geoforms. The methodological approach applied in this analysis integrates standard procedures to evaluate land cover and land use change in watersheds. Due to the practical value of the results, the data and information generated during the analysis have been made available to local authorities.

TI  - Vegetation Species Classification Using Alos/Avnir-2 Data
JO  - 30th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2009, ACRS 2009
PY  - 2009
AB  - ALOS satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor with 10-m spatial resolution and four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830 nm. Because of the spatial resolution and multi-spectral information, AVNIR-2 sensor data is expected for local area study and environmental managements. In this study. the capability of vegetation species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR2 data and UPDM method. Clear data for study area on Oct. is available. Using the Oct. data, UPDM coefficients and MVIUPD' values were studied for Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest, orchard and grass land. The relationships between water coefficients and MVIUPD, and between vegetation coefficients and MVIUPD were useful for these species classification. Using these relation ship, classification criteria were determined. The mapping results were compared with forest resource information. Japanese cedar and cypress forest were qualitatively extracted and orchard area was over estimated in forest area. The classification accuracy will be improved if seasonal data is available.

TI  - Agsat: A Smart Irrigation Application For Field-Scale Daily Crop Et And Water Requirements Using Satellite Imagery
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - With the foreseen increase in population and the reliance on water as a key input for agricultural production, greater demand will be placed on freshwater supplies. The objective of this work was to present the newly developed Android smartphone application to calculate crop evapotranspiration in real-time to support field-scale irrigation management. As part of the answer to water shortage, we embraced technology by developing AgSAT, a Google Earth Engine-based application that optimizes water use for food production. AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate daily water requirements using the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices from satellite imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefficient, Kcb. The performance of AgSAT to estimate ETref was assessed using climatic data from 18 meteorological stations distributed over several climatic zones worldwide. ETref estimation through the app showed acceptable results with values of 1.27, 0.9, 0.79, 0.95, and 0.5 for root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), modeling efficiency (NSE), concordance index (d), and percentage bias (Pbias), respectively. AgSAT guides gross irrigation requirements for crops and rationalizes water quantities used in agricultural production. AgSAT has been released, is currently in use by research scientists, agricultural producers, and irrigation managers, and is freely accessible from the Google Play and IOS Store and also at agsat.app. Our work is geared towards the development of remote sensing-based technologies that transfer significant benefits to farmers and water-saving efforts. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Adaptive Management Of Health Centers In A Changing Environment In The Democratic Republic Of Congo
JO  - Sante Publique
PY  - 2020
AB  - Introduction: For three decades, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has faced recurrent wars. These have caused a significant burden of morbidity and mortality. In this context, the Katana Health Zone experienced several events that could have hampered the functioning of its health centers, which nevertheless continued to operate. Purpose of research: This study aims to identify specific determinants that have enabled health centers to adapt to a changing context. This is a cross-sectional study using mixed data, carried out in the Mugeri, Ihimbi and Ciranga health centers during the period 1990-2017for qualitative data and from 2013 to 2017 for the quantitative data. It is based on observation, documentary review and individual interviews with 55 informants. Results: The main events identified are the recurring rebellions, the massive arrival of refugees, the arrival of humanitarian aid, the earthquakes and the instability of human resources. The supply of services and care has continued thanks to the adaptation mechanisms developed, including the development and application of new directives and standards and dynamic community participation. Conclusions: On the one hand, the study demonstrates the value of adapting the procedures for managing financial aid and the operation of a health center in the event of a change in context; the effectiveness of a more structured and regular collaboration between different actors and the appropriation of the activities of the health center by the community. On the other hand, the study identifies the limits of selective and ad hoc interventions, which do not favor the effective development of health centers. © 2020 Societe Francaise de Sante Publique.

Ces dernières ont provoqué une charge importante de morbidité et de mortalité. Dans ce contexte, la zone de santé de Katana au Sud-Kivu a connu plusieurs événements qui auraient pu entraver le fonctionnement de ses centres de santé qui, pourtant, ont continué à fonctionner. But de l'étude: La présente étude vise à identifier des déterminants ayant permis aux centres de santé de s'adapter à un contexte changeant. Il s'agit d'une étude transversale mixte, menée dans les centres de santé de Mugeri, d'Ihimbi et de Ciranga sur la période de 1990-2017 en ce qui concerne les données qualitatives et celle de 2013 à 2017 pour les données quantitatives. Elle est basée sur l'observation, la revue documentaire et des entretiens individuels auprès de 55 informateurs. Résultats: Les principaux événements identifiés sont les rebellions récurrentes, l'arrivée massive des réfugiés, l'arrivée de l'aide humanitaire, les séismes et l'instabilité des ressources humaines. L'offre des services et des soins s'est poursuivie grâce à des mécanismes d'adaptation développés, dont l'élaboration et l'application de nouvelles directives et normes et une participation communautaire dynamique. Conclusions: D'une part, l'étude démontre l'intérêt d'adapter les procédures de gestion de l'aide financière et de fonctionnement d'un centre de santé en cas de changement de contexte, ainsi que l'efficacité d'une collaboration plus structurée et régulière entre différents acteurs et l'appropriation des activités du centre de santé par la communauté. D'autre part, elle identifie les limites des interventions sélectives et ponctuelles, ne favorisant pas le développement effectif des centres de santé. © 2020 Societe Francaise de Sante Publique.

TI  - Red Tide Monitoring Method In Coastal Waters Of Hebei Province Based On Decision Tree Classification
JO  - Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences
PY  - 2022
AB  - According to the water characteristics of the coastal waters of Hebei Province, this paper selects the data of the Marine Environmental Quality Bulletin of Hebei Province from 2009 to 2018 published on the website of the Department of Natural Resources of Hebei Province, and proposes a red tide monitoring method based on decision tree classification for the pre-processed MODIS 1B image data. The most important thing in the construction of decision tree is the determination of threshold, and this process is finally determined according to the value of Entropy. In this paper, the newly constructed red tide monitoring method is used to extract the occurrence area of red tide and count the red tide area. Finally, the decision tree classification method is compared with other typical red tide monitoring methods. The experimental results show that the red tide occurrence area and statistical area extracted by the red tide monitoring method based on decision tree classification are closer to the data displayed in the Ocean Bulletin, which demonstrates that this method is suitable for red tide monitoring in the coastal waters of Hebei Province. © 2022 Kang Yan et al., published by Sciendo.

TI  - Changes In And Driving Forces Of Ecosystem Services In Tropical Southwestern China
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services and biodiversity for the world. With human activities and economic growth, tropical forests are becoming the primary sources of new plantations, making tropical regions hotspots of ecosystem service degenerations and biodiversity losses. Understanding the driving forces of ecological consequences is the key to local sustainable development and human well-being improvements. Therefore, we spatially quantified the changes in ecosystem services in tropical China in the past twenty years by remote sensing and InVEST model. The driving forces were further investigated by using Geodetector. We found that: 1) in the past twenty years, the area of evergreen broad-leaved forests, coniferous forests, and rubber forests have increased by 13.01\%, 43.39\%, and 101.23\%, respectively. The shrublands and agricultural lands are the major contributors to these increased areas; 2) with the area increasing of forests, carbon storage and soil retention have increased by 9.40\% and 0.30\%, while nitrogen export and water yield have decreased by 43.30\%, and 12.27\%. This pattern of increase in carbon storage and soil retention was found in the highlands, while not in the lowlands, where large areas of evergreen broad-leaved forests have been converted to rubber forests; 3) NDVI was highly correlated to the carbon storage (q value = 0.201) and nitrogen export (q value = 0.109), while slope and precipitation mainly affected the soil retention (q value = 0.253) and water yield (q value = 0.073), respectively. This study provides a reference for ecological protection and management in tropical China.

TI  - Systematic Monitoring Of Heathy Woodlands In A Mediterranean Climate - A Practical Assessment Of Methods
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Practical and useful vegetation monitoring methods are needed, and data compatibility and validation of remotely sensed data are desirable. Methods have not been adequately tested for heathy woodlands. We tested the feasibility of detecting species composition shifts in remnant woodland in South Australia, comparing historical (1986) plot data with temporal replicates (2010). We compared the uniformity of species composition among spatially scattered versus spatially clustered plots. At two sites, we compared visual and point-intercept estimation of cover and species diversity. Species composition (presence/absence) shifted between 1986 and 2010. Species that significantly shifted in frequency had low cover. Observations of decreasing species were consistent with predictions from temperature response curves (generalised additive models) for climate change over the period. However, long-term trends could not be distinguished from medium-term dynamics or short-term changes in visibility from this dataset. Difficulties were highlighted in assessing compositional change using historical baselines established for a different purpose in terms of spatial sampling and accuracy of replicate plots, differences in standard plot methods and verification of species identifications. Spatially clustered replicate plots were more similar in species composition than spatially scattered plots, improving change detection potential but decreasing area of inference. Visual surveys detected more species than point-intercepts. Visual cover estimates differed little from point-intercepts although underestimating cover in some instances relative to intercepts. Point-intercepts provide more precise cover estimates of dominant species but took longer and were difficult in steep, heathy terrain. A decision tree based on costs and benefits is presented assessing monitoring options based on data presented. The appropriate method is a function of available resources, the need for precise cover estimates versus adequate species detection, replication and practical considerations such as access and terrain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Utilization Of Remotely Sensed Data To Map And Evaluate Turfgrass Stress Associated With Drought
JO  - Journal of Turfgrass Management
PY  - 1997
AB  - Research was conducted to assess the suitability of using multispectral scanner data to evaluate turfgrass stress associated with irrigation management. Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) was irrigated under three different leaching fractions (LF = 0.05, 0.15, 0.25) and three different application uniformity coefficients (UC = 0.65, 0.75, 0.85). Canopy temperatures (solar noon and tissue moisture contents were measured on a 5 × 5 grid within each plot to coincide with remote sensing data acquired on July 28, 1994. Biomass was estimated from a weekly cutting (5.08 cm cutting height) taken on both the lysimeter and whole plots. Kriging was performed on 5 × 5 data sets of NDVI, canopy temperature, soil matric potential and tissue moisture content, for the most stressed turfgrass plot, to determine similarities in spatial structure as influenced by low uniformity and low leaching. The resulting isopleths indicated a similar shape for all four parameters. Results suggest that high spatial resolution (1m) multispectral data could provide NDVI values to assess turfgrass health on a microscale within large irrigated areas as influenced by the irrigation system and management practices.

TI  - Predictors Of Tree Cover In Residential Open Space: A Multi-Scale Analysis Of Suburban Philadelphia
JO  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Tree cover is an important aspect of environmental quality and quality of life, but is declining in many metropolitan regions. This study examines tree cover and its relationship with scale in a type of suburban green space that is common in the United States, residential open space. A variety of urban and residential tree cover studies exist, but none examine the factors that explain the tree cover in these small open spaces, which have the potential to support significant conservation value in developed and developing areas. This study uses remote sensing, GIS analysis, and spatial statistics to examine the characteristics and configuration of 1,900 parcels of residential open space in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburban county in the northeastern United States. As no appropriate scale has yet been established, it examines two, the subdivision-scale and census tract-scale, in this initial exploration. Results indicate that tree cover is strongly positively associated with regional residential tree cover and the presence of waterways and negatively correlated with attached dwelling units and farmland. But while these variables have the most explanatory power, open space connectivity and local government ownership, both positively associated with tree cover, are also significant and have clearer implications for open space planners and decision-makers. Findings also highlight the benefits of examining multiple scales of effect in complex suburban landscapes.

TI  - Noaa’s Role In Defining The U.s. Extended Continental Shelf
JO  - Marine Technology Society Journal
PY  - 2015
AB  - The legal continental shelf is a maritime zone that typically goes out to 200 nautical miles from shore. Itmay, however, be extended beyond 200 nauticalmiles, based in part on themorphology of the continentalmargin. The United Nations Convention on the Law of theSea sets forththe requirements for howcoastal countries can legally define such an extended continental shelf (ECS), within which they may manage the natural resources on and below the seabed. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), along with the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of State, is working to map, analyze, and define the seaward extent of the U.S. ECS. New advances in maritime technologies, such as improved multibeam echosounders, and associated visualization and analysis software aid in this effort by enabling project scientists to better understand seafloor geomorphology and interpret local and regional geologic processes. Marine geophysical data collected during this project are publicly available, benefiting the broader scientific community and public through timely data access and long-term preservation. To date, NOAA has led more than 30 high-resolution surveys and mapped more than 2 million square kilometers of sea floor in support of the U.S. ECS effort. New discoveries have been made during these surveys, and the data have contributed to better understanding of the morphology and geology of the U.S. continental margins. © 2015, Marine Technology Society Inc..

TI  - Integrating Dynamic Subsurface Habitat Metrics Into Species Distribution Models
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become key tools for describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain, environmental data used in modeling species distributions are often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako sharks lsurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory power for most species. Model predictive performance also significantly improved, but only for species that had strong affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common thresher sharks). Geospatial predictions for all species showed the integration of isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency contributed value at the mesoscale level (< 100 km) and varied spatially throughout the study domain. These results highlight the utility of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDM development and support the continuing ecological use of biophysical output from ocean circulation models.

AB  - Soft-bottom zoobenthic communities at Terra Nova Bay down to 100 m depth are mainly characterised by the presence of three species, generally occurring together and reaching high values of density: the scallop Adamussium colbecki (Smith 1902), the echinoid Sterechinus neumayeri (Meissner 1900) and the asteroid Odontaster validus Koehler 1911. These three species have a planktotrophic larval behaviour, but differ in terms of extent of gametogenic cycle and in feeding behaviour. The aim of this work is to give a first account of their reproductive conditions at Terra Nova Bay, comparing two following summer seasons, characterised by quite different ice-coverage and, consequently, food availability in the water column. The comparative analysis of the data evidences strong inter-annual differences in the scallop, a suspension-feeding species. In contrast, no significant changes were found in the two echinoderms, suggesting that a 2-year oogenic cycle, coupled with the opportunistic feeding behaviour, allow successful management of inter-annual shortcomings in food supply. On a latitudinal perspective, the comparison between data from McMurdo Sound and Terra Nova Bay shows small (for the echinoderms) or greater (for the scallop) geographical shifts in spawning occurrence.

TI  - Multipurpose Greenway Planning For Changing Cities: A Framework Integrating Priorities And A Least-Cost Path Model
JO  - Landscape and Urban Planning
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urban greenways are proven strategies to counter ecological fragmentation and improve urban sustainability. However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Eco-Tourism To Protect The Reserve Mangrove Forest The Sundarbans And Its Flora And Fauna
JO  - Anatolia
PY  - 2000
AB  - Nature based tourism is increasing throughout the world. Most is based in national parks and restricted areas. UNESCO has declared 28% of the world's largest continuous mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, as a world heritage site in 1987. But having the world's densest population, it is difficult to protect the flora and fauna unless there are economic benefits to the country as well as to the local people. This paper suggests that nature-oriented tourism can be one means to help achieve sustainability in the reserve forest as well as protecting the important world heritage site. Well-planned tourism could provide economic and political incentives for proper management and for conservation and could bring additional benefit to local communities and regional economies. The paper focuses on how to minimise the impact of tourist intervention in the reserve forest using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as a tool, Information Technology (IT), and Landsat TM remote sensing imagery as primary data sources.

TI  - Newspace: Business Models At The Interface Of Space And Digital Economy - Chances In An Interconnected World
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2016
AB  - According to Wikipedia, "NewSpace" is an umbrella term for a movement and philosophy often affiliated with, but not synonymous with, an emergent private spaceflight industry. Specifically, the term is used to refer to a community of relatively new aerospace companies working to develop low-cost access to space or spaceflight technologies and advocates of low-cost spaceflight technology and policy. While this description may be arguable, the emergence of numerous start-up space ventures within the last 15 years is a fact. These start-ups cover such diverse areas like telecommunications, Earth observation, rocketry, manned spaceflight and space tourism, energy from space, resource gathering in space, etc. and have attracted over 13.3billionofinvestment, including5.1 billion in debt financing, since 2000. Over 80 angel- and venture-backed space companies have been founded since 2000 - eight of these have been acquired, at a total value of 2.2billion. As broad as the spectrum of these ventures is, the NewSpace movement has so far been focused to a great extent on the United States, namely the West Coast. Mojave in California has been dubbed "the Silicon Valley on NewSpace", being home to several of these commercial space enterprises. In trying to understand what the driving forces behind this new ecosystem in the States are, what lessons can be learned and whether - and how - it will be possible to bring the NewSpace philosophy to Germany and Europe, the German federal ministry for economic affairs and energy has launched a study, which is to be undertaken by SpaceTec Partners and BHO Legal. While the study is not finished yet, early results show that at least four factors are of immanent importance to make NewSpace in Germany/Europe successful. These factors are related to, 1. business philosophy - such as creating and living an entrepreneurial spirit; financing - like the access to early stage risk capital and venture funding; technology management - with a clear focus on spinning-in technologies and ICT-processes and framework - setting up the right political and legal conditions such that private companies can flourish. This paper will present the insights gained, the lessons learned, the success stories and the failures, challenges and mitigation strategies cumulating into recommendations how the NewSpace movement can be established in Europe in general and in Germany particular. Given the magnitude and growing relevance of NewSpace, these insights are of high interest to stakeholders and decision makers worldwide.

TI  - Modeling The Spatial Distribution Of Soil Nitrogen Content At Smallholder Maize Farms Using Machine Learning Regression And Sentinel-2 Data
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients that indicate soil quality and an important component for plant development. Accurate knowledge and management of soil nitrogen is crucial for food security in rural communities, especially for smallholder maize farms. However, less research has been done on generating digital soil nitrogen maps for these farmers. This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms-random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076\%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083\%) and XG (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077\%) models. Furthermore, the variable importance measure showed that the Sentinel-2 bands, particularly the red and red-edge bands, have a superior performance in comparison to the environmental variables and soil indices. The digital maps generated in this study show the high capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to generate accurate nitrogen content maps with the application of machine learning. The developed framework can be implemented to map the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen. This will also contribute to soil fertility interventions and nitrogen fertilization management to improve food security in rural communities. This application contributes to Sustainable Development Goal number 2.

TI  - Collective Identity And Multiculturalism In Modern Society And Governance: European Context
PY  - 2019
AB  - Modern societies and governance, both at global and regional levels, are going through a difficult period of finding constructive political and governance strategies to overcome the migration crisis, affecting in one way or another virtually every European country and affecting the interests of a large part of their population. At the same time, in the European countries, while maintaining the connection of citizens with national states, the European community has also formed a common socio-cultural space based on the recognition of common legal, administrative and cultural reality. The methodology of the study is based on an awareness of the changes that have taken place in the perception of the concept of "identity" under the influence of challenges caused by migration processes, political populism and radicalism. The consequences of information and technological influences on the global transformations of society and governance are generalized. The dialectical method reveals the essence of "European identity" and multiculturalism, which are considered as a socio-cultural phenomenon in their direct interconnection and interdependence at the national and integration levels. The arguments have been provided in favor of the assumption that migration processes, the strengthening of right-wing radical ideas and organizations, and associated with them crisis phenomena, are not evidence of the flaw or weakness of the idea of multiculturalism. Instead, the humanistic potential of the latter in European countries is capable of overcoming these crisis phenomena and promoting a harmonious development of European society and governance.

AB  - Eucalyptus plantations are productive and short rotation forests prevalent in tropical areas that experience fast expansion and face controversies in ecological issues. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of factors influencing eucalyptus growth through plot records from the National Forest Inventories and satellite images. We find primary restricting factors for eucalyptus growth via machine learning algorithms with random forests and accumulated local effects plots, as conventional forest growth models are inadequate to calculate the causal effect with the large number of environmental and socioeconomic factors. As a result, despite common belief that temperature affects eucalyptus growth the most, we find that precipitation is the most evident restricting factor for eucalyptus growth. We then identify and rank key factors that affect timber growth, such as tree density, rotation period, and wood ownership. Finally, we suggest optimal management and planting strategies for local farmers and policymakers to facilitate eucalyptus growth.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing To Assess Cyanobacterial Bloom Frequency Across The United States At Multiple Spatial Scales
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms can have negative effects on human health and local ecosystems. Field monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms can be costly, but satellite remote sensing has shown utility for more efficient spatial and temporal monitoring across the United States. Here, satellite imagery was used to assess the annual frequency of surface cyanobacterial blooms, defined for each satellite pixel as the percentage of images for that pixel throughout the year exhibiting detectable cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial frequency was assessed across 2,196 large lakes in 46 states across the continental United States (CONUS) using imagery from the European Space Agency's Ocean and Land Colour Instrument for the years 2017 through 2019. In 2019, across all satellite pixels considered, annual bloom frequency had a median value of 4\% and a maximum value of 100\%, the latter indicating that for those satellite pixels, a cyanobacterial bloom was detected by the satellite sensor for every satellite image considered. In addition to annual pixel-scale cyanobacterial frequency, results were summarized at the lake- and state-scales by averaging annual pixel-scale results across each lake and state. For 2019, average annual lake-scale frequencies also had a maximum value of 100\%, and Oregon and Ohio had the highest average annual state-scale frequencies at 65\% and 52\%. Pixel-scale frequency results can assist in identifying portions of a lake that are more prone to cyanobacterial blooms, while lake- and state-scale frequency results can assist in the prioritization of sampling resources and mitigation efforts. Satellite imagery is limited by the presence of snow and ice, as imagery collected in these conditions are quality flagged and discarded. Thus, annual bloom frequencies within nine climate regions were investigated to determine whether missing data biased results in climate regions more prone to snow and ice, given that their annual summaries would be weighted toward the summer months when cyanobacterial blooms tend to occur. Results were unbiased by the time period selected in most climate regions, but a large bias was observed for the Northwest Rockies and Plains climate region. Moderate biases were observed for the Ohio Valley and the Southeast climate regions. Finally, a clustering analysis was used to identify areas of high and low cyanobacterial frequency across CONUS based on average annual lake-scale cyanobacterial frequencies for 2019. Several clusters were identified that transcended state, watershed, and eco-regional boundaries. Combined with additional data, results from the clustering analysis may offer insight regarding large-scale drivers of cyanobacterial blooms.

TI  - Hydrological Analysis Using Observed And Satellite-Based Estimates: Case Study Of A Lake Catchment In Raipur, India
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rainfall plays an essential role in different water management sectors ranging from industries, farming, livestock, and domestic utilization both in rural and urban areas. The surface water bodies like rivers, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs hold a huge proportion of the rainfall. However, due to spatio-temporal variability of rainfall and limited availability of meteorological stations, accurate estimation of the hydrological components such as surface runoff, evaporation, and baseflow is a challenging task. In this study, we have used hydrological information, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method to develop an empirical relationship between rainfall and runoff in the Telibandha Lake Catchment (TLC), situated in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, central India. Further, we have used Landsat derived remote sensing product, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to understand its temporal variation of water spread in the TLC over the fifteen years (2001-2015). The water spread areas are assessed by using the mean monthly NDWI data set and analyzing its seasonal and annual patterns. It is found that Telibandha Lake has a maximum depth of 2.9 m and its surface area is 0.12 km(2). Apart from that, the annual runoff is around 232.28 mm, which accounts for almost 22\% of the estimated rainfall. The monthly runoff coefficient varies from 0 to 0.25 in TLC. Both the temporal and spatial NDWI plots show that July-September months have high NDWI values in the TLC. The seasonal NDWI showed a good relationship with mean monthly rainfall data and depicts r(2) = 0.78. The findings from this study helps in determining the temporal changes of water spread within the TLC and supports in understanding the lake characteristics.

TI  - Potential And Limitations Of Open Satellite Data For Flood Mapping
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2018
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to map flooded areas. In recent years, the availability of free satellite data significantly increased in terms of type and frequency, allowing the production of flood maps at low cost around the world. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for flood mapping, based only on free satellite images and open-source software. The proposed methods are suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in remote sensing processing. As case studies, we selected three flood events that recently occurred in Spain and Italy. Multispectral satellite data acquired by MODIS, Proba-V, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1 were used to detect flooded areas using different methodologies (e.g., Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, SAR backscattering variation, and supervised classification). Then, we improved and manually refined the automatic mapping using free ancillary data such as the digital elevation model-based water depth model and available ground truth data. We calculated flood detection performance (flood ratio) for the different datasets by comparing with flood maps made by official river authorities. The results show that it is necessary to consider different factors when selecting the best satellite data. Among these factors, the time of the satellite pass with respect to the flood peak is the most important. With co-flood multispectral images, more than 90\% of the flooded area was detected in the 2015 Ebro flood (Spain) case study. With post-flood multispectral data, the flood ratio showed values under 50\% a few weeks after the 2016 flood in Po and Tanaro plains (Italy), but it remained useful to map the inundated pattern. The SAR could detect flooding only at the co-flood stage, and the flood ratio showed values below 5\% only a few days after the 2016 Po River inundation. Another result of the research was the creation of geomorphology-based inundation maps that matched up to 95\% with official flood maps.

TI  - Optimizing Societal Benefit Using A Systems Engineering Approach For Implementation Of The Geoss Space Segment
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2008
AB  - The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is driving a paradigm shift in the Earth Observation community, refocusing Earth observing systems on GEO Societal Benefit Areas (SBA). Over the short history of space-based Earth observing systems most decisions have been made based on improving our scientific understanding of the Earth with the implicit assumption that this would serve society well in the long run. The space agencies responsible for developing the satellites used for global Earth observations are typically science driven. The innovation of GEO is the call for investments by space agencies to be driven by global societal needs. This paper presents the preliminary findings of an analysis focused on the observational requirements of the GEO Energy SBA. The analysis was performed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Systems Engineering Office (SEO) which is responsible for facilitating the development of implementation plans that have the maximum potential for success while optimizing the benefit to society. The analysis utilizes a new taxonomy for organizing requirements, assesses the current gaps in space-based measurements and missions, assesses the impact of the current and planned space-based missions, and presents a set of recommendations. © 2008 SPIE.

JO  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
PY  - 2005
AB  - Due to the large capital investment and high risk generally associated with space activities only a limited number of countries have been able to benefit from the use of space technology. Space technology is often seen as an important tool to allow the transition from a developing country to a developed country. As Malaysia's vision is to be a developed country by 2020, it need to enhance the capability and capacity of its space technology at an accelerated pace. At this stage, Malaysia can be considered as new in space activities, since the first satellite successfully launched into orbit was only in 1997. This paper describes a microsatellite project undertaken in a university environment in Malaysia by the School of Aerospace Engineering from the University of Sains Malaysia (USM) where the students will be participating in the development and operations. Such involvement aim at forming an integral part of the students education extending the traditional way of teaching with practical classes thus providing hands-on experience and offering skills and experience needed by the future Malaysian space workforce, and to expand Malaysian space capacity building.

TI  - Nonimage-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy Of Palpable Axillary Lymph Nodes In Breast Cancer Patients
JO  - Breast Journal
PY  - 2012
AB  - Synopsis We report the utility of office-based, nonimaged guided fine needle aspiration of palpable axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. We examine the sensitivity and specificity of this procedure, and examine factors associated with a positive fine needle aspiration biopsy result. Abstract: Although the utility of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) of axillary lymph nodes is well established, there is little data on nonimage guided office-based FNA of palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of nonimage-guided FNA of axillary lymphadenopathy in patients presenting with breast cancer, and report factors associated with a positive FNA result. Retrospective study of 94 patients who underwent office-based FNA of palpable axillary lymph nodes between 2004 and 2008 was conducted. Cytology results were compared with pathology after axillary sentinel node or lymph node dissection. Nonimage-guided axillary FNA was 86% sensitive and 100% specific. On univariate analysis, patients with positive FNA cytology had larger breast tumors (p = 0.007), more pathologic positive lymph nodes (p < 0.0001), and were more likely to present with a palpable breast mass (p = 0.006) or with radiographic lymphadenopathy (p = 0.002). FNA-positive patients had an increased presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.001), higher stage of disease (p < 0.001), higher N stage (p < 0.0001), and higher rate of HER2/neu expression (p = 0.008). On multivariate analysis, radiographic lymphadenopathy (p = 0.03) and number of positive lymph nodes (p = 0.04) were associated with a positive FNA result. Nonimage-guided FNA of palpable axillary lymphadenopathy in breast cancer patients is an inexpensive, sensitive, and specific test. Prompt determination of lymph node positivity benefits select patients, permitting avoidance of axillary ultrasound, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or delay in receiving neoadjuvant therapy. This results in time and cost savings for the health care system, and expedites definitive management. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Galileo Maritime Navigation Performance In Challenging Operational Environments
JO  - ENC-GNSS 2008 - European Navigation Conference
PY  - 2008
AB  - Will Galileo make a significant difference to maritime navigation in challenging operational environments? The expected and intuitive answer to the question is 'yes'. However, in order to substantiate this claim it is necessary to bridge the gap between performance evaluation of existing GNSS systems and identification of their weaknesses, and the existence of concrete scientific evidence that supports the use of Galileo in order to overcome these weaknesses. In the absence of the real Galileo system, simulation is the only recourse. Thales Research & Technology (UK) Ltd., TRT, have developed and utilised the Thales Integrated Navigation Test-bed, TINT, to confirm and quantify any potential benefits arising from the introduction of the Galileo satellite positioning system. The TINT facilitates the simulation of maritime mission scenarios, providing a good characterisation of GNSS navigation signals for both GPS and Galileo and the means by which they are processed to produce a navigation solution. Furthermore, this characterisation accounts for all operational and environmental factors that significantly affect the performance of a GNSS system. The mission scenarios are intended to support the investigation of the potential of Galileo to improve upon current GNSS-based maritime navigation system performance and as such, are aligned with the three of the MARUSE† maritime demonstrations: • A ship entering Trondheim harbour in Norway and docking. • A ship navigating within Oban sound in Scotland in a manner representative of an Aid to Navigation, AtoN, management scenario. • Inland waterway navigation of barge entering and exiting the Djerdap lock complex on the River Danube in Serbia. Significantly, the Oban mission scenario also addresses the use of a local element (LE) in the form of Galileo pseudolites to augment the positioning performance in a challenging operational environment. The paper introduces the TINT simulation facility and provides an overview of the functionality it offers. In particular, there is a strong emphasis on the capability to simulate realistic multipath characteristics, derived from complex 3-D models, a key requirement in order to support the analysis of navigation performance in the challenging environments. The paper continues by describing in more detail these challenging environments and the three mission scenarios. For each scenario, test cases were carefully chosen in order to cover a broad spectrum of operational conditions and produce a rich set of navigation system performance results. The analysis of these results is then targeted to provide performance characteristics in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability that will help quantify to what extent the introduction of Galileo can be expected to improve GNSS based maritime navigation system performance. Results and analysis are presented for both absolute and differential solutions for combined GPS and Galileo GNSS navigation performance versus single GNSS navigation performance; assessed under malign conditions with severe satellite signal multipath and obscuration and compared to a benign operational environment. The ability of pseudolites to improve positioning performance is also determined. Finally, the paper summarises the findings, which although in general agree with the intuitive and expected answer predicted in the introduction, it identifies specific conditions where this is not always the case and examines the reason for this.

AB  - CropWatch agroclimatic indicators (CWAIs) are a monitoring tool developed by the CropWatch global crop monitoring system in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; www.cropwatch.com.cn, Wu et al Int J Digital Earth 7(2):113-137, 2014, Wu et al Remote Sens 7:3907-3933, 2015). Contrary to most other environmental and agroclimatic indicators, they are "agronomic value-added", i.e. they are spatial values averaged over agricultural areas only and they include a weighting that enhances the contribution of the areas with the largest production potential. CWAIs can be computed for any time interval (starting from dekads) and yield one synthetic value per variable over a specific area and time interval, for instance a national annual value. Therefore, they are very compatible with socio-economic and other variables that are usually reported at regular time intervals over administrative units, such as national environmental or agricultural statistics. Two of the CWAIs are satellite-based (RAIN and Photosynthetically Active radiation, PAR) while the third is ground based (TEMP, air temperature); capitals are used when specifically referring to CWAIs rather than the climate variables in general. The paper first provides an overview of some common agroclimatic indicators, describing their procedural, systemic and normative features in subsequent sections, following the terminology of Binder et al Environ Impact Assess Rev 30:71-81 (2010). The discussion focuses on the systemic and normative aspects: the CWAIs are assessed in terms of their coherent description of the agroclimatic crop environment, at different spatial scales (systemic). The final section shows that the CWAIs retain key statistical properties of the underlying climate variables and that they can be compared to a reference value and used as monitoring and early warning variables (normative).

TI  - Vegetation Types Mapping Using Alos/Avnir-2 And Prism Data Using Universal Pattern Decomposition Method
PY  - 2010
AB  - Vegetation species maps are useful for forestry managements and environmental ecological study. From the forestry management, broad and conifer leaf forest should be mapped. In addition to them, land-cover mapping data with high resolution is needed as validation data sets for low resolution's land-cover mapping results. SGLI sensor on board GCOM-C satellite, which will be launched in 2014, has 250m spatial resolution and it's data will be used for making global land-cover data set. ALOS satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor and PRISM sensor. AVNIR-2 sensor has four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830nm with 10-m spatial resolution. PRISMsensor has panchromatic band from 520nm to 770 nm with 2.5m spatial resolution. If use the both of image, pseudo high spatial multi-spectal image can be processed. Because of the spatial resolution and multi-spectral information, these sensor data are expected to useful for making high resolution land-cover data set. We have developed Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM)(Zhang, L.F. et. al, 2006 (Zhang et al., 2006)) and Modified Vegetation Index based on UPDM (MVIUPD)(Zhang, L. F. et. al, 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) and Xiong, Y., 2005 (?)) for satellite sensor data analysis for land cover mapping and vegetation monitoring. In the UPDM method, three coefficients of water, vegetation and soil is calculated using three standard patterns of water, vegetation and soil. One of this method's characteristics is the UPDM coefficients from different sensors for the same object being same as each other. The capability of vegetation species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR-2 data and UPDM method. Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest, orchard and grass land can be classified using AVNIR-2 summer and winter data. In this study, AVNIR-2 and PRISM data are used for vegetation types mapping using universal pattern decomposition method. Firstly, the pan-sharpen image was processed using AVNIR-2 and PRISM data. Each band's Digital Number (DN) value of AVNIR-2's band is calculated using DN of PRISM and AVNIR-2. The reflectance of AVNIR-2 is calculated from calculated DN values. UPDM method is applied to the set of re-calculated reflectance. Using the coefficients of UPDM and vegetation index, evergreen forest and deciduous forest were classified using two seasonal data. These results are compared with forest resource information. The tendency was agree with each other, although detailed validation is needed. From these results, the UPDM method can be applied to pan-sharpen image and the pan-sharpen image can be used for vegetation type classification. In the near future, calculation methods with retaining the original reflectance should be improved.

TI  - Quantification Of Impervious Surface In The Snohomish Water Resources Inventory Area Of Western Washington From 1972-2006
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2008
AB  - A 34 year time series (1972-2006) of Landsat imagery for a portion of Snohomish and King Counties, Washington (the Snohomish Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA)) was analyzed to estimate the amount of land that was converted into impervious surface as a result of urban and residential development. Spectral unmixing was used to determine the fractional composition of vegetation, open, and shadow for each pixel. Unsupervised and supervised classification techniques were then used to derive preliminary land cover snaps for each time period. Digital orthophotos were used to create agricultural, forest management, high elevation, and riparian masks. In conjunction with established Urban Growth Areas (UGAs), these masks were utilized for the application of spatial rules that identified impervious surface as a surrogate for urban and residential development. Temporal rules, that minimized classification error, were developed based on each pixel's classified trajectory over the time series of imagery. Overall cross-date classification accuracy for impervious v. non-impervious surface was 95\%. The results of the analysis indicate that the area of impervious surface in the Snohomish WRIA increased by 255\% over 34 years, from 3285 ha in 1972 to 11,652 ha in 2006. This approach demonstrates the unique value of the 35 year Landsat archive for monitoring impervious surface trends in rapidly urbanizing areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Aerial Cooperative Multi-Robot System For Remote Sensing And Automated Victim Search
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
PY  - 2023
AB  - This paper presents a distributed coverage control scheme for initially rapid scanning of the environment and then automated victim search in a large-scale firefighting scenario using a cooperative multi-agent system. The quick and efficient reaction of the disaster recovery team can significantly decrease damages and losses. Therefore, a comprehensive map of the affected area immediately after disaster occurred, leads to quickly initial assessment of damages, economic losses and casualties, which can highly improve the efficiency of further relief actions. We considered a firefighting scenario in which fixed-wing UAVs initially fly over the affected area and accomplish a generally and quick scan to identify the critical sections where the fire caused more damage and had a high intensity, severity and spread rate. Then, multi-rotors hover as close as possible to exactly locate the victims and survivors or also damaged infrastructure for more detailed information, and then, firefighters can plan the rescue mission more efficiently. We applied a distributed coverage control scheme so that a heterogeneous multi-agent system cooperatively could explore the affected area and search for the exact location of probable victims or survivors. To achieve this goal, UAVs collaboratively build the cognitive maps including target probability map (TPM) and uncertainty map (UM). Then, based on cognitive map and also their prediction of the next moves of themselves and their neighboring agents as well, UAVs make decision about their optimal collision-free paths. The efficiency of the implemented algorithm is demonstrated by comparison between cooperative and non-cooperative methods. The results indicate that in cooperative distributed scheme, coverage percentage and global average uncertainty converge to their admissible maximum and minimum value in a considerably less time, respectively.

TI  - A Review Of Precision Technologies In Pasture-Based Dairying Systems
JO  - Irish Journal of Agricultural and Food Research
PY  - 2021
AB  - The promised benefits of precision technologies (PTs) include improved efficiency, quality, animal health and welfare and reduced environmental impacts. To date, PTs (including sensors, algorithms, big data, decision-support tools, etc.) have had a relatively modest impact in pasture-based dairying systems in comparison with other agricultural sectors such as arable production. The areas animals roam and graze in pasture-based systems and the associated connectivity challenges may, in part at least, explain the comparatively reduced use of PTs in those systems. Thus, there are very few technologies designed specifically to increase pasture utilisation with the exception of global positioning systems (GPS) and Bluetooth-enabled Plate Meters. Terrestrial and satellite-based spectral analysis of pasture biomass and quality is still in the development phase. Therefore, one of the key drivers of efficiency in pasture-based systems has only been marginally impacted by PTs. In contrast, technological development in the area of fertility and heat detection has been important and offers significant potential value to dairy farmers. In general PTs can be described as good at measurement, data collection and storage but fall down around interpretation and providing useful outputs to end users. As a result, it is unclear if farm management is being sufficiently improved to justify widespread adoption of PTs. A needs-driven development of PTs and decision-support tools are required for the succesful integration within agriculture. Further cost/benefit analysis is also required to determine the efficiency of investing in PTs and what, if any, factors affect the variation in the returns. © 2021 Sciendo. All rights reserved.

AB  - For many practical applications, such as planning for satellite orbits and space missions, it is important to estimate the future values of the sunspot numbers. There have been numerous methods used for this particular case of time series prediction, including recently neural networks. In this paper we present genetic programming technique employed to sunspot series prediction. The paper investigates practical solutions and heuristics for an effective choice of parameters and functions of genetic programming. The results obtained expect the maximum in the current cycle of the smoothed series monthly sunspot numbers is 164-20, and 162-20 for the next cycle maximum, at the 95% level of confidence. These results are discussed and compared with other predictions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.

TI  - Modeling The Global Distribution Of Culicoides Imicola: An Ensemble Approach
JO  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Culicoides imicola is a midge species serving as vector for a number of viral diseases of livestock, including Bluetongue, and African Horse Sickness. C. imicola is also known to transmit Schmallenberg virus experimentally. E nvironmental and demographic factors may impose rapid changes on the global distribution of C. imicola and aid introduction into new areas. The aim of this study is to predict the global distribution of C. imicola using an ensemble modeling approach by combining climatic, livestock distribution and land cover covariates, together with a comprehensive global dataset of geo-positioned occurrence points for C. imicola. Thirty individual models were generated by 'biomod2', with 21 models scoring a true skill statistic (TSS) > 0.8. These 21 models incorporated weighted runs from eight of ten algorithms and were used to create a final ensemble model. The ensemble model performed very well (TSS = 0.898 and ROC = 0.991) and indicated high environmental suitability for C. imicola in the tropics and subtropics. The habitat suitability for C. imicola spans from South Africa to southern Europe and from southern USA to southern China. The distribution of C. imicola is mainly constrained by climatic factors. In the ensemble model, mean annual minimum temperature had the highest overall contribution (42.9\%), followed by mean annual maximum temperature (21.1\%), solar radiation (13.6\%), annual precipitation (11\%), livestock distribution (6.2\%), vapor pressure (3.4\%), wind speed (0.8\%), and land cover (0.1\%). The present study provides the most up-to-date predictive maps of the potential distributions of C. imicola and should be of great value for decision making at global and regional scales.

TI  - ¿Why Are We Ignoring The Relief? On The Bias Of Planimetric Instead Topographic Areas In Ecological And Spatial Modeling Researches
JO  - Ecosistemas
PY  - 2020
AB  - Spatial information, satellite products and their derivatives are important sources of environmental information. However, the accuracy of area and distance measurements is sacrificed by using planimetric projections and consciously ignoring relief irregularities, essential in ecological studies where the important estimate area is those perceived by organisms and the real surface of which resources density depend. In this paper, we assess differences in estimation of geographic areas accounting for or ignoring terrain topology, in ecological studies applications or distribution modeling, in Cuban archipelago. By using parcels and virtual species simulated distributions we assess the bias size in those estimations over a topological area derived from a digital elevation model, with 26.8m of spatial resolution. Underestimation bias can reach in Cuba up to 1598 m2 of differences, equivalent to 45% of error. Errors are higher in mountain regions. We probe that equally planimetric size parcels can reach differences up to 15%, depending on location and included proportions of relief types. Changes in potential distribution area estimates for virtual species present errors over 700 km2. If using relativized values, the error diminishes. More studies are in need on the methodological impact of this bias, mostly for its implications for ecological conclusions or on its potential influence in management decisions. © 2020 Los Autores.

TI  - Application Of Remote Sensing For Assessment Of Change In Vegetation Cover And The Subsequent Impact On Climatic Variables
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - The impacts of vegetation cover changes (VCCs) and land use land cover changes (LULCCs) on climate variabilities need to be addressed while maintaining healthy urban development. This study aimed to evaluate LULCCs and VCCs and their impacts on land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall in the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India. Landsat data and climate hazard group infrared precipitation with stations (CHIRPS) were used to assess LST or LULCCs and rainfall, respectively, over the study area. Results showed a decline in vegetation cover to 11.73\% (26,857.43 ha) in the year 2019 from 19.12\% (43,733.61 ha) in 1999. Also an increase in built-up and cropland by 4.9\% (11,224.6 ha) and 4.38\% (10,043.2 ha), respectively, was observed in the last 20 years. With decreasing vegetation cover in the study area, the mean LST increased while the mean annual rainfall decreased for the study period. The Mann-Kendall trend (MKT) test exhibited no significant trends for LST and rainfall with p values of 0.43 and 0.69, respectively, although Sen's slope indicated variability in LST and rainfall even though it was insignificant over the study area. The study would identify areas requiring immediate action for saving its resources and providing insight into upholding its competence. The findings would also lead to proper decision making for the concerned stakeholders, assuring sustainability in appropriate planning of land use and utilisation of resources and maintain the agroclimatic condition.

TI  - Advances In Assessing <I>Sabellaria Spinulosa</I> Reefs For Ongoing Monitoring
JO  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2018
AB  - Standardized and repeatable data acquisition and analyses are required to enable the mapping and condition monitoring of reefs within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Changes in habitat condition must be reliably identified and reported to best support evidence-based management. Biogenic reefs in temperate waters, that is, hard matter created by living organisms and raised above the seabed, provide food and shelter for many plant and animal species. This article explores the feasibility of habitat mapping, using remote sensing datasets, as well as metrics for repeatable and suitable assessment of areas of Sabellaria spinulosa for their status as biogenic reef. Data were gathered within the North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reef candidate Special Area of Conservation/Site of Community Importance in the southern North Sea. Six study areas were identified as potential locations of biogenic reef using previously acquired data, and these were targeted for further investigation using a combination of high resolution multibeam echosounder and sidescan sonar. Where potential S.spinulosa was identified from the acoustic data, a drop-down camera system was employed for visual verification. Areas of known and potential S.spinulosa reef were mapped successfully at two of the six study areas, although future approaches should take careful consideration of the seabed morphology and predominant habitat backdrop to successfully interpret such data. Camera tows from S.spinulosa reef areas were broken up into 5-s segments, with each segment scored for (a) average tube elevation; (b) average percentage cover; and (c) for the presence or absence of S.spinulosa. These metrics were utilized to create summary statistics, including a value of patchiness derived from presence/absence data, that is recommended for application as part of future monitoring programs. The application of this methodology could benefit wider assessments of similar threated or declining habitats such as intertidal Mytilus edulis beds on mixed and sandy sediments, Maerl beds, Modioulus modiolus beds, Ostrea edulis beds, and Zostera beds where patchiness may also be considered of environmental importance.

TI  - Space For Society: How Eurisy's Activities And Research Support Publicawareness Raising On Satellite Applications In Meeting Societal Needs
JO  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
PY  - 2021
AB  - When we talk about Space, our interlocutors think about planets, stars, asteroids, astronauts and, sometimes satellites. But, only a small percentage is aware of what satellite technology can do and the relevance of satellite applications in our everyday life. From satellite communication, to navigation and to earth imagery, satellites data and technology are contributing in improving our daily life, or businesses or helping the management of our cities. Often, the end users come across an obstacle in communicating their needs to the service providers. On the other side, the service providers themselves are not fully aware how to communicate with the end-users. In some cases, this lack of communication makes difficult to meet the demand of space applications from the user side with the supply from the service providers. Eurisy, an association of space agencies established thirty years ago, works to put the end users at the core of the space value chain. In this last decades, Eurisy has been attentive and responsive to the changes of the space sector trying to picture how end users are becoming familiar with space technology. In particular, how the democratisation of space is turning space, especially satellite technology, into an enabler to guarantee the development of a sustainable living, accessible to everyone. Eurisy recently started a review of the case studies collected over the last ten years thanks to direct testimonials, event and conferences, publications and surveys. The user-centred approach adopted is innovative in the space sector and over the years proved to be effective in connecting users and service providers in different contexts. The paper aims at: 1-Identifying challenges and barriers that characterise the relations between service and/or information providers and end users. 2- Analysing the changes occurred in the relations between end users and service providers from 2007 to date in Europe. 3- Presenting the reasons that motivates the use of satellite data and technologies and which of these is the most used. 4- Presenting Eurisy's approach as an applicable model outside the European borders and the benefits deriving from connecting space and society. Furthermore, the paper will briefly present the ongoing activities as examples of the work put in place by the organisation and how the user-centred approach is applied.

TI  - Gradient Path Labelling Method And Tracking Method For Calculation Of Solar Differential Rotation Using Coronal Bright Points
JO  - Astronomy and Computing
PY  - 2018
AB  - With new space missions, such as Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), solar images are being produced in unprecedented volumes. To derive, as much as possible, information on evolution of solar activity from those huge datasets, the scientific community needs a new generation of software tools for automatic and efficient data processing. In the last decade, several research teams have been developing tools for obtaining more precise estimations of the solar rotation profile, but more are needed to improve knowledge about solar activity. We applied here a segmentation algorithm called Gradient Path Labelling (GPL), used originally to identify drusens in medical retinal images, to detect and track the coronal bright points (CBPs) using images from the AIA instrument onboard the SDO satellite. The CBPs have a tendency to change shape and size along time, to disappear and reappear at a corresponding heliographic position, therefore, decision trees were also included in the tracking solution. Since our CBP detection algorithm uses an active region mask to filter out the CBPs, whose centroid is inside the active regions, the number of identifications clearly depends on the level of solar activity. Our approach uses the commonly applied fitting relation to the latitudinal dependence of the rotational velocity, which resulted in calculation of the optimum fit parameters as well as the Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials. Comparison of these parameters with the results presented in recent papers on this topic shows that our rotational velocity profile indicates slightly lower rotational velocities than the profiles obtained with other approaches. We also calculate the meridional motion of the CBPs, but comparison with other authors results, clearly show that a 3-day time interval is too short to estimate the latitudinal dependence of the CBP meridional motion. Distributions of the rotational velocity and meridional motion velocity uncertainties show that 85% of uncertainty values are lower than 1 degree/day. The evaluation of our test results shows that the applied algorithm is a promising tool that can help to refine the solar rotational profile. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Role Of Remote Sensing During A Global Disaster: Covid-19 Pandemic As Case Study
JO  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery is used as a tool to aid decision makers and scientists in a variety of fields. A recent world event in which satellite imagery was extensively relied on by a variety of stakeholders was the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article we aim to give an overview of the types of information offered through remote sensing (RS) to help address different issues related to the pandemic. We also discuss about the stakeholders that benefited from the data, and the value added by its availability. The content is presented under four sub-sections; namely (1) the use of RS in real-time decision-making and strategic planning during the pandemic; how RS revealed the (2) environmental changes and (3) social and economic impacts caused by the pandemic. And (4) how RS informed our understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for the pandemic. High resolution optical imagery offered updated on-the-ground data for e. g., humanitarian aid organizations, and informed operational decision making of shipping companies. Change in the intensity of air and water pollution after reduced anthropogenic activities around the world were captured by remote sensing - supplying concrete evidence that can help inform improved environmental policy. Several economic indicators were measured from satellite imagery, showing the spatiotemporal component of economic impacts caused by the global pandemic. Finally, satellite based meteorological data supported epidemiological studies of environmental disease determinants. The varied use of remote sensing during the COVID-19 pandemic affirms the value of this technology to society, especially in times of large-scale disasters.

AB  - This chapter focuses on flood risk analysis and risk prevention in Santiago de Chile. It presents a conceptual framework for flood risk analysis in urban areas and demonstrates the utility of a mixed set of methods, including remote sensing and GIS techniques, to improve the methodological basis for flood risk assessment and risk prevention. Population growth and land-use changes are analysed as key elements of urban development and indicators of flood risk production. A conceptual framework comprising the core elements of exposure, elements at risk and vulnerability serves as a tool for risk analysis and risk assessment, and is applied to the municipalities of La Reina and Penalolen. The chapter reviews existing institutional responses to land-use and risk management and, based on expert interviews, detects their deficits. As a conclusion, recommendations to improve flood risk prevention in Santiago de Chile are made. The absence of a systemic view of flood risk resulting from complex ecological and social processes is the chief weakness of current risk prevention in Santiago de Chile.

TI  - Cellular Automata And Markov Chain (Ca_markov) Model-Based Predictions Of Future Land Use And Land Cover Scenarios (2015–2033) In Raya, Northern Ethiopia
JO  - Modeling Earth Systems and Environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - Little is known about the future land use and land cover (LULC) type in some parts of Ethiopia, but not in the study area. This study aims to predict and analyze the future scenarios of LULC (2015–2033) using cellular automata and Markov Chain model (CA_Markov) by taking into consideration the physical and socio-economic drivers of LULC dynamics. The historical LULC change data of 1984–1995, 1995–2015, and 1984–2015 were used as a baseline. Both transition rules and transition area matrix for the period 1984–1995, 1995–2015, and 1984–2015 were produced quantitatively using the Markov chain model. After that, the physical and socio-economic factors were standardized using fuzzy and then Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) was used to produce the transition suitability image. The CA_Markov model was then applied as a standard contiguity filter of 5 × 5 to predict the 2033 LULC condition using the TerrSet Geospatial Modeling and Monitoring System software. The result indicated that forestland are predicted to increase by 108 sq km (44.5%), shrub/bush lands 710 sq km (20%), built-up area 286.2 sq km (48.3%), and grasslands 31 sq km (15%), respectively. However, significant reductions (losses) in a water body (Wb) 5.2 sq km (11.2%), croplands (Cl) 78.9 sq km (1.3%), barren lands (Bl) 800 sq km (27.4%), and floodplain area (Fp) 251.68 sq km (33.7%), respectively. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation result between the historical and predicted LULC type indicated that there are positive, strongly correlated, and are statistically significant relationships (r = 0.981, p = 0.000). The increase in forest land and reduction in barren and flood plain may benefit the study area. However, the decrease in the water body may contribute to the severity of drought in the area. This study may help to use as useful information to foster better decisions and improve policies in land use within the framework of sustainable land use planning system. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Input Data Resolution Affects The Conservation Prioritization Outcome Of Spatially Sparse Biodiversity Features
JO  - AMBIO
PY  - 2023
AB  - Detailed spatial data are an essential part of land use planning and decision-making. Their spatial resolution sets limitations to their use, as coarse datasets are not suitable for detecting small-scale phenomena. In this study, we explored the effects of spatial resolution on the ecological outcome of a conservation prioritization process in Zonation software. Our study area was in Evo, southern Finland, covering a mosaic of managed and conserved forests. We produced the feature layers describing the forest characteristics using high-resolution remote sensing datasets, object-based mapping methods, and forest site type data. We found that increasing the resolution above the 16 m baseline resolution resulted in substantial errors. The conservation errors were the highest for rare features related to European Aspen, whereas the common features related to dominant tree species could benefit from the growth of cell size. We conclude that adequate spatial resolution is a prerequisite for efficient conservation prioritization, and that the size and spatial distribution of the features affect the resolution requirements.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Single Tree Data Enable The Determination Of Habitat Thresholds For The Three-Toed Woodpecker (Picoides Tridactylus)
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Forest biodiversity conservation requires precise, area-wide information on the abundance and distribution of key habitat structures at multiple spatial scales. We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Contributions Of Tele-Intensive Care Unit (Tele-Icu) Technology To Quality Of Care And Patient Safety
JO  - Journal of Critical Care
PY  - 2013
AB  - The deployment of remote monitoring of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, known as tele-ICU technology, promotes the efficient use of critical care resources. Although tele-ICU use has spread rapidly, the benefits vary widely among studies, and little is known about the specific characteristics of tele-ICU that provide benefits to patient care. The purpose of this study was to identify aspects of tele-ICU that contribute, whether positively or negatively, to care processes and patient outcomes. This study was not aimed at evaluating the impact of tele-ICU on care outcomes. We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Sixty-one tele-ICU staff from 5 tele-ICUs participated in the study. We performed inductive content analysis and coded 722 pieces of text into 19 positive and 9 negative/neutral tele-ICU contributions to care processes and patient outcomes. We found that availability of extra resources can reduce on mortality and length of stay, that a tele-ICU could serve as a quality trigger to improve evidence-based medicine compliance, that tele-ICU can support medication management and improve medication safety, and that tele-ICU software alerts and monitoring by camera can help reduce the risk of patient falls and extubations. We also found that tele-ICU physicians can make poor care decisions leading to medication errors if they lack patient-related information. Moreover, the tele-ICU has no impact on patient care processes and outcomes when the technology is not accepted and used by ICU staff. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An Application Of Grace Mission Datasets For Streamflow And Baseflow Estimation In The Conterminous United States Basins
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Runoff and baseflow estimates provide critical information on surface and groundwater flow dynamics, water resource availability, and water usage patterns for effective water resource planning and management. Developing a physical-based model at large spatial scales such as continental/global scales require extensive datasets, complex parameterization, and higher computational capacity. Recent advances in satellite datasets related to water cycle process modeling, on the other hand, involve less parameterization and more effective computation over larger spatial and finer temporal scales. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical flux in the water cycle that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy from satellite-based information by using complementary relationship (CR) concepts. Similarly, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission satellite datasets provide useful estimates of total water storage change over large spatial extents. GRACE datasets have been extensively used in groundwater storage change and groundwater depletion studies. However, the application of GRACE data products for estimating runoff and baseflow is limited. Therefore, in this study, we used a CR approach to estimate ET and a water balance method for estimating runoff and baseflow over the Conterminous United States (CONUS). We evaluated the CR-based water balance model (CR-GRACE) with United States Geological Survey (USGS) runoff datasets based on hydrologic unit code level-2 (HUC-2) basin boundaries. The CR-GRACE model estimated annual runoff values agreed with USGS runoff values with root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient values of 14.7 mm/month and 0.81, respectively. We also evaluated the CR-GRACE model with two well-known Land Surface Models (LSM), Noah-LSM and Variable Infiltration Capacity LSM (VIC-LSM), from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) database. The comparison results for baseflow estimates from the CR-GRACE model have improved over Noah-LSM and VIC-LSM model estimates with RMSE values of 62.16, 101.00, and 207.32 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the CR-GRACE model to estimate runoff and baseflows with limited parameterization and datasets.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment Of Noise Mapping On The Main Street
JO  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2018
AB  - Among the sounds constituting a part of our daily lives, the undesired and disturbing ones are named noise. The noises can be defined as the acoustic energy that affects the physiological and psychological welfare of humans due to its direct or indirect effects on the human health. But, the traffic noise, which is one of the disturbing noises having wide dispersion in urban areas, affects the health of a gradually increasing number of people. The number of studies on measurement, dispersion, and mapping of traffic noise in developed and developing countries is gradually increasing. It can be seen that the studies concentrate on mapping based on the city centers and neighborhoods, where the traffic is intense. In this article, unlike the regional noise measurement studies, the transversal cross sections were established with a certain interval according to the land status along the main street, and the noise measurement points were determined using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The daily mean noise levels (L-den) were calculated by performing the measurements at daytime, evening, and nighttime. Using ArcGIS 10.4 software, the accuracy of noise maps created via inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis function (RBF), and ordinary kriging (OK) geostatistical analysis interpolation methods and the dispersion effect of traffic noise were compared. According to the visual method and error corrections, it was found that the best noise map was obtained using the RBF method. It is believed that the map provides accurate and reliable results because of the flat land surface, higher noise values measured on the road region, decrease in the noise at the points farther from the road region, and soft transitions between the noise values depending on the distance from the road. In order to take measures in order to decrease or eliminate noise on the main street, the local administrators and decision-makers can make use of these maps, the accuracy of which has been confirmed.

TI  - Mississippi Water Utilizing Nasa Earth Observations To Assist The Audubon Mississippi Coastal Bird Stewardship Program With Habitat Monitoring And Restoration Planning Activities
JO  - Imaging and Geospatial Technology Forum, IGTF 2015 - ASPRS Annual Conference and co-located JACIE Workshop
PY  - 2015
AB  - Coastal and migratory bird habitats in Mississippi are highly dynamic and constantly threatened by human activity. Today, these coastal and migratory species are typically found on managed public lands. However, as of 2014 the Pascagoula River Audubon Center (PRAC) and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) reported shorebird populations in coastal Mississippi are continually in decline. In response, the Mississippi Audubon Coastal Bird Stewardship Program (CBSP) plans to focus on more than 20 sites in coastal Mississippi. This includes: planning and conducting standardized monitoring, implementing best-practice restoration projects, and a campaign to educate diverse audiences to increase understanding of the threats to and environmental/societal benefits of coastal and migratory birds. To support these efforts, this project used Landsat 8 OLI imagery from 2012 to 2014 to produce habitat classification maps that incorporated land use land cover, vegetation health, and water quality indices of areas in coastal Mississippi where these vital bird habitats are located. The project focused on at-risk coastal bird species such as the least tern. Products and methodologies aided end-users in focusing habitat restoration efforts based on individual species' propensity to a particular area.

TI  - A Two-Stage Iterative Optimazation Method For The Coordinated Task Planning Of Space And Air Observation Resources
JO  - Kongzhi yu Juece/Control and Decision
PY  - 2021
AB  - In order to improve the coordinated observation efficiency of space and air observation resources, this study proposes a two-stage iterative optimization method to solve the coordinated task planning problem of space and air resources, which is under the divide and conquer framework. In the first stage, the fitness function is formed according to two indices, ie., observation opportunity and conflict degree. And tasks are assigned to different sub-planners based on the fitness vaule. In the second stage, each sub-planner schedules observation resources according to the assigned tasks and generates corresponding task planning schemes. The resources observation schemes and related observation profit are returned to the first stage. Iteratively, the resources observation scheme is adjusted and updated to generate approximate optimal or satisfied task assignment schemes and resources observation schemes by using a tabu-list based optimization strategy, with the consideration of the feedback of task planning shemes. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage iterative optimization method, this study has done extensive simulated experiments. The results show that the proposed method can increase the total task profits by about 2.40 % ~ 14.14 %, compared with the highest weight first assignment (HWFA) algorithm, the task assignment algorithm based on fitness value (TAAFV) and the task assignment algorithm based on resource priority (TAARP). The achievement of this study can realize the effective coodinated task planning for space and air observation resources. Copyright ©2021 Control and Decision.

TI  - Mapping Natural Resource Collection Areas From Household Survey Data In Southern Africa
JO  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
PY  - 2020
AB  - As conservation landscapes are threatened by global change, there is a growing need to understand relationships between human livelihoods and environmental processes. This often involves integrating multiple data sources capturing different scales of measurement. Participatory methods have emerged as a means to accomplish this, but are hampered by a wide range of challenges associated with data collection and translation. Here, we present a novel methodology for mapping human use of natural resources that overcomes many of the difficulties faced in participatory mapping. Based in the world's largest terrestrial transfrontier conservation area, we couple household surveys with in-situ fine-scale mapping to identify key resource areas that support local livelihoods. This allows for a spatially referenced human use 'footprint' that can be combined with remotely-sensed data measuring environmental impact. This methodology is applicable across contexts and has implications for landscape management and conservation.

TI  - Nasa?S Global Precipitation Measurement Mission: Leveraging Stakeholder Engagement \& Applications Activities To Inform Decision-Making
JO  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - The application of satellite precipitation estimates from NASA's Global Precipitation Measure-ment (GPM) Mission for decision-making has been a focus for the mission since launch. As a result, GPM data have enabled a range of applications that address societal needs, including water resource management, crop forecasting, ecological monitoring, disaster response, public health, aviation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling, among others. GPM applications activities have continued to focus on user engagement through in person trainings and interviews, work-shops, webinars, and educational outreach activities. The goals of these efforts are to synthesize community data needs in order to effectively support and enable decision-making across agencies, academia and the global community. While these efforts have helped the GPM mission establish a large stakeholder community that encompasses federal and state partners, academic institutions, and private and nonprofit companies, there remains difficulties associated with accessing, pro-cessing, and applying the data to support or enable applications. In this article, we present GPM applications strategies and approaches used to enhance the applications value of GPM data, and most importantly, demonstrate how these efforts have and can inform different decision-making contexts. This work also provides a discussion on key lessons learned from the user community and how this information can be utilized to help better support and shape applications ap-proaches for future NASA Earth Science missions.

TI  - Geochemical Sampling Scheme Optimization On Mine Wastes Based On Hyperspectral Data
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2008
AB  - Spatial sampling optimization is an important issue for both geo-chemists and geo-statisticians. Many spatial sampling optimization methods have been previously developed. In this paper, we present a spatial simulated annealing method is presented using hyperspectral data.This sampling method was applied in a project concerning environment assessment of the Dexing Copper Mine. Mine waste contains high concentrations of metals, mostly of a non-economic value. Most of them are discharged without any decontamination, for example, acid-generating minerals. Acid rock drainage can adversely have an impact on the quality of drinking water and the health of riparian ecosystems. To assess or monitor environmental impact of mining, sampling of mine waste is required. Optimal geochemical sampling schemes, which focus on ground verification of mine wastes extracted from hyperspectral data, was derived automatic from a JAVA program.Hyperspectral data help to identify ground objects by a larger spectral range. Spectral angle mapper classification technique is carried out to obtain rule images. A rule image provides weights that are utilized in defining the objective function for the sampling scheme. These are optimized by means of simulated annealing. The simulated annealing uses the Weighted Means Shortest Distance (WMSD) criterion between sampling points. The scaled weight function intensively samples areas where an abundance of weathering mine waste occurs. A threshold is defined to constrain the sampling points to certain areas of interest.

TI  - Determining Land Use/Land Cover (Lulc) Changes Using Remote Sensing Method In L?Leburgaz And Lulc Change's Impacts On Sdgs
JO  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urbanization is among the human activities that affect the quality of urban life and sustainable urban development at a global scale. For monitoring human-induced changes in cities, studies on the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) based on a series of satellite images along with geographic information systems (GIS) are widely used. This study aims to evaluate the LULC changes in Luleburgaz between 2001 and 2021. For this purpose, the impacts of urban growth on natural areas and how these areas are handled in the context of sustainable development goals are examined, and the effects of urbanization on land use change are evaluated. The accuracy of the LULC maps was evaluated by means of the general accuracy index and the Kappa index. The overall accuracy rates of the land use maps for 2001, 2010, and 2021 were 96.32\%, 93.66\%, and 95.91\%, respectively, while Kappa values were 0.95, 0.91, 0.94. These results indicate that, due to the effect of rapid urbanization and population growth over the last two decades, the built environment increased by 4.82\% and the agricultural land has decreased by 4.88\%. This result is a testament to the upward trend in the built environment at the expense of depleting a significant amount of agricultural land. The findings of the study provide useful data that can aid authorities in making conscious decisions to achieve sustainable urban planning and to improve environmental conditions.

TI  - Assessment Of Rock Glaciers And Their Water Storage In Guokalariju, Tibetan Plateau
JO  - Cryosphere
PY  - 2024
AB  - Rock glaciers are important hydrological reserves in arid and semi-arid regions. Their activity states can indicate the existence of permafrost. To help further explore the development mechanisms of rock glaciers in semi-arid and humid transition regions, this paper provides a detailed rock glacier inventory of the Guokalariju (also known as Goikarla Rigyu) area of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using a manual visual interpretation of Google Earth Pro remote sensing imagery. We also estimated the water volume equivalent (WVEQ) in the study area for the first time. Approximately 5057 rock glaciers were identified, covering a total area of μ404.69 km2. Rock glaciers are unevenly distributed within the three sub-regions from west to east, with 80 % of them concentrated in the central region, where climatic and topographic conditions are most favorable. Under the same ground temperature conditions, increases in precipitation are conducive to rock glaciers forming at lower altitudes. Indeed, the lower limit of rock glaciers' mean altitude decreased eastward with increasing precipitation. Estimates of the water storage capacity of rock glaciers obtained by applying different methods varied considerably, but all showed the potential hydrological value of rock glaciers. The possible water storage in the subsurface ice of rock glacier permafrost was 1.32-3.60 km3. The ratio between the amount of subsurface ice stored in rock glaciers and surface ice stored in local glaciers falls within the range of 1:2.32 to 1:1.26, with an average ratio of 1:1.69. In the west region, where the climate is the driest, the water storage capacity of rock glaciers was estimated to be up to twice as large as that of the sub-region's glaciers. Changes in water resources and permafrost stability in the area where rock glaciers occur will have implications for regional water resource management, disaster prevention, and sustainable development strategies. © Copyright:

AB  - Thuringia in the German midmountain range is facing several environmental problems like river straightening resulting in frequent floods, the degradation of wetlands, the pollution of drinking water reservoirs by non point source entering of solute nutrients as well as the decrease of biodiversity which need actual and area covering earth observation data for management decisions. Data from various sensors of the visible, infrared and the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum are evaluated for the derivation of thematic maps. The Remote Sensing Lab of the Department of Geoinformatics of the FSU Jena is cooperating with the departments of nature preservation, regional and water resources management of the Thuringian Environmental Agency (TLU) or the Thuringian Reservoir Administration (TTV), providing them with information derived from remote sensing data for their benefit in practical applications. The remote sensing evaluations ser:ie as input data for geographical information systems or hydrological models in general and concentrate on water balance and water quality. The parameters derived cover the following topics: soil moisture, albedo, start of transpiration, surface temperature, LAI - NDVI - fractional vegetation cover, land cover, catchment topography, water quality and are applied in the various studies. Objectives, methods and validated results will be presented for all the example studies. As conclusion and outlook the paper will present the possibilities of the use and operationalisation of remote sensing data for environmental applications in governmental agencies.

TI  - A Satellite Image Classification Approach By Using One Dimensional Discriminant Analysis
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2018
AB  - The classification problem in the image processing field is an important challenge, so that in the process image pixels are separated into previously determined classes according to their features. This process provides a meaningful knowledge about an area thanks to the satellite images. Satellite images are digital images obtained from a satellite vehicle by the way scanning the interest areas with some specified sensors. These sensors provide the specific radiometric and spatial information about the surface of the object. This information allows the researchers to obtain reliable classification results to be used to solve some real life problems such as object extraction, mapping, recognition, navigation and disaster management. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised method that reduces the dimensions of data in respect to the maximum discrimination of the elements of the data. This method also transfers the data to a new coordinate space in which the discriminant features of the classes are highest using the objection data provided manually. In this work, we consider the classes as if the satellite images have two classes; one is foreground and the other is background. The true classes such as roofs, roads, buildings, spaces and trees are treated sequentially as the foreground. The area outside the foreground class is treated as the background. The one dimensional reduced feature values of pixels, such that each value is reduced according to the binary classification of each class, are considered as membership values to the classes. In this way, each pixel has membership values for each of the classes. Finally, the pixels are classified according to the membership values. We used the ISPRS WG III/4 2D Semantic Labeling Benchmark (Vaihingen) images includes the ground truths and give the accuracy result values for each class. © Authors 2018. CC BY 4.0 License.

TI  - Burned Area Detection Using Sentinel-1 Sar Data: A Case Study Of Kangaroo Island, South Australia
JO  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Burned-area maps are useful in disaster management and in response to bushfire events. In this paper, we explored the capabilities of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 in detecting and mapping the bushfire-affected areas. Fires in Kangaroo Island, Australia, in 2019-20 known as the "Black Summer" were selected as a case study. We applied a random forest method to the Sentinel-1 image classification to detect the burned areas over Kangaroo Island. Radar burn difference (RBD), radar burn ratio (RBR), and delta modified radar vegetation index (Delta RVI) were calculated and imported as inputs to the random forest classifier. An independent reference map was generated using the difference normalize burn ratio (dNBR) and Sentinel-2 images and was used as the ground truth to evaluate the accuracy of the SAR-based burned-area detection map. Our results show that the SAR-based burned area detection map outperforms the MODIS MCD64. The feature importance in the random forest method indicates that RBDVH is the most important index (importance value of 0.35) followed by RBDVV (0.20), Delta RVI (0.18), RBRVH (0.17), RBRVV (0.10). The random forest method's precision, accuracy and kappa index were 94\%, 94\%, 0.87, respectively, while corresponding metrics for the MODIS MCD64 products were 92\%, 91\%, 0.83, respectively.

TI  - Changes Of Land Use And Functions Of Ecosystem Service: A Case Study In China
JO  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
PY  - 2019
AB  - We studied the quantity and spatial and dynamic changes of land use and ecosystem service functions in Nanping City from 1995 to 2015 using of Landsat TM/ETM images in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2005, and 2015. The results show that the main land use types in the study area were forest land, cultivated land, and grassland, and the rapid growth rate of forest land was in sharp contrast with the decrease of cultivated land. In the conversion of six land use types, conversions among the forest land, cultivated land, and grassland were the most frequent. The forest was spatially schistose distribution and the grassland was clustered in the central and eastern parts, and the construction land was clustered to the central urban area, and the cultivated land was particularly broken, and the distribution pattern changes of the water area and unused land were not obvious. The dynamic changes of cultivated land, construction land, and unused land were more intense and their stability were worse, and the activity of land use in the study area was also increasing. The value of ecosystem services in Nanping was on the rise, and the contribution rate of forest ecosystem services was the highest, which accounted for more than 85\% of the whole ecosystem service function, followed by grassland and cultivated land. The contribution rate of water area and unused land decreased less, while the contribution rate of unused land was minimal. Population is one of the driving factors that affect land use changes and the value of ecosystem services in Nanping.

PY  - 2009
AB  - South Africa has embarked on the important challenge of establishing a space agency of its own, The South African National Space Agency (SANSA). The challenges address an array of social, economic, political, scientific, and technological benefits. They are designed to stimulate multidisciplinary thinking and to challenge the country's researchers to answer questions, create new disciplines and develop new technologies. The country expects that it will possess an independent earth observation high-resolution satellite data till 2018, available for all of Africa from a constellation of satellites designed and manufactured in Africa. The proposed SANSA is to address some strategic objectives, including environment and resource management, safety and security, and innovation and economic growth. South Africa is anticipating the upcoming launch of Sumbandilasat, a high-performance South African micro-satellite with a multi-spectral line-scan camera payload, producing high-resolution images suitable for a wide range of scientific applications.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Ndvi Pattern Of Global Mangroves: A Growing Trend During 2000–2018
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mangroves are coastal vegetation with high ecological and economic value that are mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical intertidal zones. In the past, they have been degraded by extensive deforestation for agricultural and aquatic land. In recent years, mangroves have been protected and sustainably used through considerable measures of conservation, restoration and afforestation, but the health trends of mangroves during this process are not clear. To identify the mangrove health conditions and dynamics, we investigated the spatial-temporal trends of global mangroves using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset during 2000–2018. The results illustrated that 1) Asian mangroves had the highest NDVI values, especially in Southeast Asia (0.80), while the average NDVI of African mangroves was the lowest (0.67). NDVI values higher than 0.80 were mainly located in Southeast Asia and South America, which accounted for 24.0 % and 7.1 % of the global mangrove area, respectively. 2) Globally, the proportion of mangrove forests that increased significantly (23.6 %, p value < 0.05) was approximately twice as large as the significant decrease (10.7 %, p value < 0.05). Asia, where mangroves are widespread, accounts for nearly half of the world's significant increase (10.8 %) and decrease (4.6 %). Generally, the annual average NDVI for global mangroves exhibited a slow increasing trend from 2000 to 2018 (p value = 0.13). 3) The global mangrove NDVI showed a positive correlation with precipitation (Rprep = 0.79, p value < 0.01) and temperature (Rtemp = 0.37, p value < 0.01), while it was inhibited by sea surface salinity (Rsss = −0.45, p value < 0.01) on a scale of 1° of latitude. 4) The results of the overall growth trend of mangroves indicated that global mangrove conservation appeared to achieve initial success, but direct or potential factors, such as salinity stress, natural disasters, small-scale deforestation, construction of coastal facilities, and sea level rise, still threaten the survival of mangroves, leading to a decline in their health status. This study provides information on the health status of mangrove ecosystems and can assist in formulating subsequent conservation and management measures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the large area, there is a tendency towards higher water demands than in the past, so significant water storage, such as reservoirs and canals, has been added in the watershed area. On the one hand floods often occur during the rainy season, because there are rain storms and excessive water in the reservoirs. On the other hand, during the dry season there is insufficient water, because water in the reservoirs is released without accurate planning during the rainy season. Thus, improving water resources management is becoming more and more necessary. The purpose of this session is to calculate water budget for the accurate planning of water management. Then, there are three main parts of this research: actual evapotranspiration; rainfall; and water budget. First, actual evapotranspiration was calculated by SEBAL and the FAO Penman-Montieth equation. The time period for actual evapotranspiration calculations from SEBAL and from the FAO Penman-Monteith computations is one year. In the SEBAL method, MODIS images were used for daily actual evapotranspiration estimation, while weather data from weather stations was used to produce daily actual evapotranspiration using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. Thereafter, actual evapotranspiration values calculated from the FAO Penman-Monteith method were compared with actual evapotranspiration values calculated from SEBAL to determine the suitable actual evapotranspiration for the calculation of water budgets. Second, rainfall was obtained from TRMM images and rain gauge stations. The time period for rainfall data from TRMM images and from rain gauge stations is one year. Thereafter, monthly rainfalls from TRMM image were compared with monthly rainfall from rain gauge station to determine the suitable monthly rainfall for the calculation of water budgets. Finally, monthly water budgets were calculated. The main inflow for basin is rainfall, while the main outflow for each basin is actual evapotranspiration. Then, monthly actual evapotranspiration and monthly rainfall were utilized for the monthly water budget calculations. Regarding, the contribution of this session, the combination of evapotranspiration and rainfall from satellite imagery to compute water budget in large scale is new. Accordingly, after the results that can be applied to river basins and analyzing water management, the methodology can also be applied in other countries around the world. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

TI  - Understanding Treescape Changes As The Basis Of Urban Forest Planning In Fringe Areas
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2018
AB  - We selected the Mapo-Niulanshan township located in the urban fringe of the Beijing metropolis as a case study with the goals of understanding urban forest change dynamics and locating potential spaces for conserving and developing urban forests, in the context of land use change associated with rapid urbanization. The results revealed an increase in canopy cover and forestland with the urbanization process. There was a significant increase in canopy cover in highly developed areas due to rising landscape needs and regulatory demands. The majority of forestland was converted from farmland and consisted of tree nurseries that usually lacked a recognizable canopy cover in remote sensing images. The influence of population density (POP) was strongest, followed by those of the built-up area ratio (BCOV) and gross industrial production (GIP). These socioeconomic factors had varying effects on the spatial heterogeneity of the urban forest landscape. Most of the areas demonstrated a positive influence of socioeconomic factors on urban forest landscape, especially those adjacent to water bodies and forestland. Based on the R-2 values of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, unquantifiable indicators, such as policies and public preferences, were deemed very important in shaping urban forest landscape. According to the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM), suitable land for the development of urban forest mainly concentrated in the peripheral regions. Our research confirms that canopy cover must be considered with forestland area in spatial pattem analysis of the urban forest landscape. The results of the socioeconomic influence analysis and the MCRM helps to advance the understanding of urban forestry conservation and could improve policy-making and practices that promote urban forest under the pressure of urbanization.

TI  - Analysis Of Land Function Classification And Transformation In County Based On Remote Sensing Image
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2016
AB  - Land use/cover change caused by urbanization and industrialization had changed the function of land. In order to explore the evolution law of regional land function, taking Huanghua city, Hebei province as the research area, this paper first classified the land function and analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics and law of land function in 2008-2014 using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) data, and then the biological production function and the value of the ecological environment function were calculated using production capacity accounting model and net primary productivity model to reveal the evolution process of land function value. In the course of land function classification, based on the tree classification method, the two-level classification systems were adopted. According to the main function of land and the difference of land use pattern, the research area was divided into 6 functional categories and 21 functional subcategories. In order to show the result of land function classification, fully reflect the relationship between the various land functions within the region and reflect the land function type, combination and distribution law of the study area, the land distribution maps of Huanghua city in 2008 and 2014 were drawn respectively taking the leading principle as the basic principle. Then it output the function information in graphic mode. It could be seen through the comparison, the functional area of the biological production in the land function category increased most. It totally increased by 3648.8 hm2. It showed that in recent years Huanghua city used land development and consolidation, brick kiln reclamation, fertilization and irrigation, and salt and alkali elimination method. The other functions had improved. It had the ability to provide people with agricultural products. The land area of land biological production was significantly increased. The land area of the ecological environment function was reduced by 8238.3 hm2. In recent years, with the rapid development of regional economy, a large number of ecological and environmental function land changed to other functional land use, especially the tidal flat wetland and water area (a total change area of 6246 hm2), and the land with biological production function (3622.1 hm2). The salt field was transformed to raw material supply function by 2124.96 hm2. Most of the rest was converted to the load bearing function. Load bearing capacity of the land area had increased by 2265.6 hm2. This paper took the biological production function and ecological environment function as an example. The change of function value was analyzed. Production capacity of agricultural land represented the size of the functional value of biological production. Main idea was that in the first place the crop yield per unit area and the corresponding agricultural land use index were established. Then the agricultural land classification unit use indices were substituted into the corresponding function equation. It could be calculated to achieve their yield per unit area. The classification unit of agricultural land could realize that the value of land biological production function was calculated from the yield per unit area yield multiplied by the corresponding area. Ecological service value represented ecological environment function. The value of ecosystem services was based on the spatial and meteorological data. Combining with the investigation of foreign trade, the net primary productivity and other models could calculate. By comparing the value of the function, it showed that the biological production function of cultivated lands and fields had been generally improved from 2008 to 2014; Except the unchanged "the other lands' ecological environment function", the function values of other sub-functions decreased to different extents. The results could provide scientific basis for land function evaluation, ecological red line delineation and land use planning. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese ociety of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - This paper describes a study (2013-16 period) on some technological and economic data extracted from the Panel of firms registered in ASI's (Italian Space Agency) DV web db and portal, with the aim of assessing the sector's capacity to transfer space technology into business, in both the so called â€œspace relatedâ€ and â€œspace enabledâ€ areas. The Panel hereabove is estimated to cover 90% of the sector and applies methodologies, metrics and definitions - see especially those describing the above areas, as separate fields from the core space upstream and downstream domain - shared with the main international boards on space statistics (OECD, IAF). ESA even took inspiration from these methodologies and definitions within a Pilot test instrument, now on its website (Space Economy section - Global Space Economy Forum), to collect and compare space economic data from Member Countries. This work concentrates on the technological part of the study, which otherwise provided economic insights of a growing activity estimated 5-10% compared to the space production value, considering in the count also business transferred for its management to dedicated subsidiaries. The mainstay definition applied to these activities is in their being connected to space but not crucially, at a level, so to say, where â€œthey could also exist withoutâ€ space. In this, they differentiate from the so called general space â€œdownstreamâ€, whereas the rule relays for us on the opposite statement or â€¦ â€œthey could not exist withoutâ€. The definition above firstly applies to a closer and bordering layer (to the downright space activity area) of activities which we define as â€œspace relatedâ€, where space technologies are ongoing but their integration is not absolutely necessary, as happens with communication and localization services in urban areas. It is the case for instance of Sat tv and Car sharing (that could also rely on different terrestrial technologies), or smartphones or insurance services assisted by satellite positioning. Connected to the latter, and much more interesting for our purposes, layer of activities, that we define â€œspace enabledâ€, where space technologies are only the â€œtriggerâ€ of their terrestrial development, which ensues independently. A list of cases of this "layer" is offered, covering supermaterials and industrial subsystems (fashion brand accessories, car consoles, optical semiconductors, refrigerators), aeronautics hardware (radars, emergency floaters devices, parachutes, ground service devices), medical scanning devices and applications, industrial test and R&D equipment, telemetric systems for sport cars. It appears hence that space has a wide innovative industrial potential due to its top quality and performance standards, or, in other terms, that the extreme space challenge, enhances competitivity for ensueing terrestrial uses. It is finally appearing that the firms having these capacities are also better performing by space standards, in production and employment terms, and therefore provide leverage for public strategies.

TI  - Spectrum Efficient And Power Efficient Communication System For Satellite Applications
JO  - ACM International Conference Proceeding Series
PY  - 2018
AB  - For the satellite application, the spectrum efficient and power efficient communication is very important. However, there is a big trade-off between the spectrum efficiency and power efficiency in the communication system design. 4D-8PSK-TCM (4 dimensional 8 phase shift keying trellis coded modulation) communication system could be the one strong candidate for the best solution to this trade-off problem, which was recommended in Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) satellite communication. However, the detailed design and performance evaluation of the 4D-8PSK-TCM communication system has not been clearly studied and reported. So, in this paper, the design method of the 4D-8PSK-TCM communication system will be described at first. Secondly, the characteristics of peak to average power ratio (PAPR), spectral characteristic, and constellation characteristic according to the square root raised cosine (SRRC) filtering are determined for each transmission efficiency mode. Finally, bit error rate (BER) performance according to each reception processing step is evaluated and analyzed. With the simulation results, the PAPR characteristic and the spectral characteristic can be obtained to evaluate. Good PAPR characteristics can be shown when the roll off factor values are 0.35 and 0.5, and the spectral waveforms have been confirmed. © 2018 ACM.

TI  - Defining A Communications Satellite Policy System For The 21st Century: A Model For A International Legal Framework And A New "Code Of Conduct"
JO  - Acta Astronautica
PY  - 1996
AB  - This paper addresses the changing international communications environment and explores the key elements of a new policy framework for the 21st Century. It addresses the issues related to changing markets, trade considerations, standards, regulatory changes and international institutions and law. The most important aspects will related to new international policy and regulatory frameworks and in particular to a new international code of ethics and behavior in the field of satellite communications. A new communications satellite policy framework requires systematically addressing the following points: · Multi-lateral agreements at the nation state and the operating entity level · Systematic means to access both private and public capital · Meshing ITU regulations with regional and national policy guidelines including "landing rights" and national allocation procedures. · Systematic approach to local partnerships · Resolving the issue of the relative standing of various satellite systems (i.e. GEO, MEO, and LEO systems) · Resolving the rights, duties, and priorities of satellite facility providers versus types of service providers. Beyond this policy framework and generalized legal infrastructure there is also another need. This is a need that arises from both increased globalism and competitive international markets. This is what might quite simply be called a "code of reasonable conduct:" To provide global and international communications services effectively and well in the 21st Century will require more than meeting minimum international legal requirements. A new "code of conduct" for global satellite communications will thus likely need to address: · Privacy and surveillance · Ethics of transborder data flow · Censorship and moral values · Cultural and linguistic sensitivity · Freedom of the press and respect for journalistic standards As expanding global information and telecommunications systems grow and impact every aspect of modern life, the need for new international policy and especially new suitable standards of conduct in the field of satellite communications become ever more apparent and necessary.

JO  - Indiana State University - 21st Biennial Workshop on Aerial Photography, Videography and High Resolution Digital Imagery for Resource Assessment 2007
PY  - 2007
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data are often collected in conjunction with multispectral imagery and aerial photography. LIDAR data have primarily been used to create terrain products for topographic modeling and image orthorectification. However, LIDAR data may also be exploited to derive information on vegetation height, density, and structure. This study explores the utility of LIDAR-derived vegetation height and density products for improving multispectral image-based classification of vegetation fire fuels within canyo ns of the City of San Diego. Five classes of vegetation fire risk defined by a Wildland Fire Risk/Hazard Severity Assessment model developed by the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department are analyzed, which range from bare soil to tall, dense shrubs and trees. It is demonstrated that classification accuracy is substantially improved when LIDAR-derived products and visible/nearinfrared (V/NIR) multispectral imagery are used, compared to classification based on V/NIR multispectral imagery alone. The techniques presented for LIDAR-based vegetation characterization and combined classification with multispectral imagery are broadly applicable to resource management.

TI  - Analyzing Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using Remote Sensing And Gis In Rize, North-East Turkey
JO  - SENSORS
PY  - 2008
AB  - Mapping land use/land cover (LULC) changes at regional scales is essential for a wide range of applications, including landslide, erosion, land planning, global warming etc. LULC alterations (based especially on human activities), negatively effect the patterns of climate, the patterns of natural hazard and socio-economic dynamics in global and local scale. In this study, LULC changes are investigated by using of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in Rize, North-East Turkey. For this purpose, firstly supervised classification technique is applied to Landsat images acquired in 1976 and 2000. Image Classification of six reflective bands of two Landsat images is carried out by using maximum likelihood method with the aid of ground truth data obtained from aerial images dated 1973 and 2002. The second part focused on land use land cover changes by using change detection comparison (pixel by pixel). In third part of the study, the land cover changes are analyzed according to the topographic structure (slope and altitude) by using GIS functions. The results indicate that severe land cover changes have occurred in agricultural (36.2\%) (especially in tea gardens), urban (117\%), pasture (-72.8\%) and forestry (-12.8\%) areas has been experienced in the region between 1976 and 2000. It was seen that the LULC changes were mostly occurred in coastal areas and in areas having low slope values.

AB  - Institutional issues will dominate technical issues as GIS (Geographic Information Systems) technology becomes integrated with the information management operations of public organizations. Analysis of the legal setting in which a particular GIS is established is now recommended as part of the planning and design process, particularly as it impacts public access to the system. The form and content of information provided to the public and private user community through GIS technology demands a new and more discriminating vocabulary to avoid unintended pitfalls from traditional laws developed before an information management tool of this utility was available to government. Establishing institutional policy to deal with GIS technology focuses many of the most significant legal issues that should prove determinative in the debate over who controls the value of information.

AB  - Prior to the launching of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1) less than 3 quarters of the earth's habitable land had been mapped in extensive detail, and at least a third of the existing maps were out of date. The ERTS has shown its capability in mapping the earth's natural resources and for monitoring air and water pollution, charting land use, and monitoring crop damage due to pests and disease. The ERTS orbit offers the opportunity for imaging all of the earth's surface once every 18 days, providing systematic, repetitive global coverage under conditions of maximum consistency. Maps prepared from the ERTS data usually can be made in half the time required by conventional methods, and cost savings are considerable in relation to the degree of accuracy obtained. A few of the many specific benefits which ERTS has provided are discussed in this paper, including: urban development, transportation and pollution; transportation planning; waste emissions; land use inventory; crop classification and mensuration; insect infestation; soil survey and mapping; timber and range resources; fire hazards; and resources management.; The ERTS spacecraft has shown its capability for mapping the natural resources, and also for monitoring air and water pollution, charting land use and monitoring crop damage due to pests and disease. The many specific benefits which ERTS has provided are discussed.

TI  - Policy Instruments For Supporting Renewable Energy Sources In Slovak Republic
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2014
AB  - In January 2008, the EU published a document which declared its targets on renewable energy use. On its basis, EU committed to achieve 20% share of renewable energy sources on final energy consumption and 10% of biofuels in transport by 2020. In Slovak republic up to 35% of the technically disposable renewable energy potential falls to biomass. Biomass is a potential energy source for heat, electricity, and biogas and biofuels production. For a broader utilization of this renewable energy source it is necessary to create appropriate technological, legislative and economic conditions. One of the options is state support. This article deals with state policy instruments supporting renewable energy sources use implemented in Slovak republic. The aim is to describe the current state of state support, then to analyse the benefits and shortcomings of individual instruments as well as the whole state support system. Regarding fiscal instruments, mainly income taxes and selective consumption taxes were analysed. The non-fiscal instruments analysed were mainly direct financial support for production and biomass use for energy purposes and relevant legislation. © SGEM2014.

TI  - Facsimile Machines For Medication Order Transmission
JO  - Topics in hospital pharmacy management / Aspen Systems Corporation
PY  - 1991
AB  - The use of facsimile machines for medication order transmission has improved turnaround time and provided benefits for the Department of Pharmacy Services and the hospital. As a result of this program pharmacists have more time and more opportunities to improve drug therapy because they no longer have to travel to patient care units or handle patient charts for the purpose of order entry. Pharmacists will have even more time when technicians have been fully trained to carry out medication order entry. Important also is the ability for nurses to FAX rather than hand carry urgently needed orders to the pharmacy satellites. The use of FAX machines in this manner lowers the cost of patient care and makes this technology available for other purposes as well. It is becoming increasingly clear that pharmacists, as well as others, can utilize modern technology such as this to maintain and improve services in the presence of a cost-containment environment.

TI  - Landscape Evaluation Of Grizzly Bear Habitat In Western Montana
JO  - Conservation Biology
PY  - 1999
AB  - We present a method for evaluating the cumulative effects of human activity on grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) habitat in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of western Montana. Using logistic regression, we modeled the relative probabilities of female grizzly bear resource selection from telemetry data, TM satellite imagery (greenness), elevation, human activity points, roads, and trails. During spring, adult female grizzly bears were positively associated with low- and mid-elevation habitats. Logistic regression coefficients were negative for all road and human activity variables. Summer and fall coefficients were also negative for road, human activity, and trail variables. During summer and fall, females were positively associated with mid to high elevations. Coefficients were positive for greenness during all seasons. Extrapolations of seasonal potential and realized habitat models were made to other areas on the western side of the region where no telemetry data existed. During spring, much of the Bob Marshall Wilderness exhibited a relatively low probability of use by female grizzly bears, but the converse was observed during summer and fall. The mapping and extrapolation process highlighted areas where habitat restoration would have the greatest benefit. These areas were typically low-elevation spring habitats with high road densities and private lands where urbanization occurred. We recommend that habitat management agencies implement reductions in road densities in seasonal habitat and implement methods to maintain habitat function on private lands.

TI  - Community-Based Health Financing: Care India's Experience In The Maternal And Infant Survival Project
JO  - Research in Healthcare Financial Management
PY  - 2002
AB  - In a rural Indian population beset with inadequate health access due to socio-cultural and economic factors, CARE India under the Maternal and Infant Survival Project encouraged village women to form Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and to save health funds collectively. After 15 months of implementation, CBOs were formed in 345 of 447 project villages and health funds were operational in 203 villages. A total of 292 persons benefited from health funds through loans for treatment of obstetric complications and infant illnesses. Additional initiatives include social marketing, sales of disposable delivery kits, and village drug banks. Over half (56 percent) of the loans were repaid within the grace/low interest period. This experience demonstrates that village women, when appropriately encouraged, are capable of creating rules and managing health funds. The process empowers village women (through access to resources and information and the strength of social capital) to make decisions and act to improve their well being.

TI  - Mapping The Value Of National Forest Landscapes For Ecosystem Service Provision
PY  - 2018
AB  - Natural landscapes provide ecosystem services that are critical to human health and society. However, as landscapes are threatened by urban development, climate change, intensive agriculture, and altered fire regimes, this negatively affects the condition of natural ecosystems and reduces the provision of these services for which there may not be viable alternatives. We report on a project to map the value of national forest lands in southern California for ecosystem service provision. Our focus is on quantifying five types of ecosystem services, water runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment erosion retention, carbon storage, and biodiversity, across an area that encompasses the four southern national forests-the Angeles, Los Padres, San Bernardino, and Cleveland. We first develop environmentally and climatically driven ecological units as a practical way to summarize information on services for resource managers. Second, we map the spatial distribution of the five services under current climate conditions and assess the spatial concordance between the five services. Third, using a conceptually straightforward approach, we prioritize the ecological units that provide the highest amount of each service and identify hotspots of ecosystem services where ecological units contain multiple services. By providing results to resource managers and the means to access and query the data, information can be used to guide decision making (e. g., prioritizing areas for conservation and restoration activities), assess the impacts of proposed activities (e. g., the impact of fuel management on ecosystem service provision), provide estimates of the value of chaparral shrublands for fire damage assessments, and help secure the long-term provision of ecosystem services across the landscape. The maps and data generated in this project provide the foundation for the next step that is calculating the economic value of these services.

TI  - Spatially Enabling Australia - The Next Decade
JO  - International Journal of Digital Earth
PY  - 2010
AB  - A strategy for the development of the Australian spatial information industry called 'Spatially Enabling Australia' has recently been developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information. It comprises three fundamental research programs and an integrated applications program. Research Program 1, 'Positioning,' underpins a full framework of continuous operating reference stations to ultimately enable all of continental Australia to be capable of realtime precise positioning services based on global navigation satellite systems. Research Program 2, 'Automated Spatial Information Generation,' addresses complex processing of multiple remote sensing sources. Research Program 3, 'Spatial Infrastructures,' helps form the foundation for development of an Australian Spatial Marketplace that will make accessible vast amounts of government held data under a new licensing and access regime which supports combination with user-generated content from the mass market. The three core programs are integrated with Program 4, 'Applications,' to support users from the Health, Defense and Security, Energy and Utilities, Urban Development, and Agriculture-Natural Resources-Climate Change sectors. Program 4 drives outputs from the three core research programs in sector-specific deployments for high impact. This will see a rapid acceleration of the use and value adding of information products and services that utilize spatial information. There are considerable research and development challenges that must be met in order to achieve the strategic outcomes. © 2010 Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information.

TI  - Spatial Expert Support System In Selecting Suitable Sites For Water Harvesting Structures — A Case Study Of Song Watershed, Uttaranchal, India
JO  - Geocarto International
PY  - 2003
AB  - The aim of this paper is to make a user friendly Spatial Expert Support System (SESS) for identifying suitable sites for water harvesting structures such as check dams, farm ponds, and groundwater recharge tanks. The developed system has been used to identify potential sites for water harvesting in the Song watershed, India. Basic input layers required for this study such as a digital elevation model, landuse, soils, drainage, geology, and buffer map for utility points were generated in a geographic information system (GIS). Technical guidelines suggested by the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD), and the Indian National Committee on Hydrology (INCOH), have been used as decision rules in the knowledge base shell of the developed SESS. Monthly water balance has been estimated using remote sensing and GIS techniques to augment the proposed water harvesting structures. The knowledge base can suitably be modified as and when required on the basis of other expert knowledge if found more judicious in this present context. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Evaluation Of The Automated Reference Toolset As A Method To Select Reference Plots For Oil And Gas Reclamation On Colorado Plateau Rangelands
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rangelands are typically characterized by low precipitation and low biomass which makes them susceptible to disturbance and difficult to reclaim. These characteristics become a management issue when considering the widespread and significant impact of oil and gas development on rangelands. Reclamation from this land use involves the complexities of dealing with multiple state and federal agencies, private landowners, and their sometimes conflicting rules. Reference plots (e.g., nearby undisturbed sites) can help with these issues by providing an objective context for reclamation planning. They are selected to provide a comparison that is similar to a reclamation site in most aspects except for the disturbance activity. This allows for the relative condition of the reclamation site to be determined. Because selection of reference plots is normally expert-driven on a site-by-site basis, it can be time consuming and thus ineffective in helping to meet reclamation goals over large landscapes. The Automated Reference Tool (ART) was developed to improve the efficiency and efficacy of reference plot selection. The ART improves reference plot selection through remote sensing and indicators of land potential by selecting reference plots of similar land potential to the reclamation site based on soil texture, topography, and geology. We evaluated the ART in the context of well-pad reclamation to determine if ART-selected plots were appropriate to use as reference when compared to an existing reference plot network. We applied the ART to reclamation sites managed by the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) White River Field Office, Colorado which had existing expert-selected reference plots. We found that the ART-selected reference plots and their matching expert-selected reference plot had similar large-scale vegetative cover characteristics (total foliar: R2 = 0.34, p-value = 0.0012) and dissimilar finer-scale cover characteristics (plant diversity: R2 = 0.079, p-value = 0.15). In addition, we detected similarities in their soil water content (R2 = 0.43, p-value<0.001), depth to restricting layer (RMSD = 21.90), and rock fragment (RMSD = 19.99). These results demonstrate that ART could be a useful tool for managers to help meet their reclamation goals over large landscapes, but it is not a complete automation of the reference selection process. © 2020

TI  - Grizzly Bear Selection Of Recently Harvested Forests Is Dependent On Forest Recovery Rate And Landscape Composition
JO  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - Forests in the early stages of regeneration are valuable habitat for threatened grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations inhabiting the interior mountains of North America, with forest management affecting the timing, prevalence, and quality of such habitats. Forest harvesting can lead to early-seral habitat, however the quality and duration of post-harvest habitat compared to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire), is not known. North American silvicultural practices are mandated to ensure tree regrowth following harvesting, and a rapid rate of growth in managed tree regeneration may lead to a shorter time window during which attractive early-seral habitat is available to bears compared to natural forest disturbances. The distribution of natural disturbances across forested landscapes may also be an important consideration in the response of bears to forest harvesting. In this study, we analyzed grizzly bear habitat selection for 160 collared grizzly bears across 118,000-km(2) (68\% of their known habitat) in Alberta, Canada, using metrics of forest disturbance and recovery derived from a 33-year satellite time series. We developed seasonal resource selection functions to evaluate (1) if selection of recently harvested forests was contingent upon the availability of natural disturbances, (2) how habitat selection within disturbed areas varied across disturbance types, and (3) how habitat suitability changed over time during the first 30 years of forest recovery following various disturbance types. Results showed that, compared to areas not recently disturbed, grizzly bears were up to three times more likely to select for harvested forests when natural disturbances were limited in their home range, while selection of harvested forests was neutral when natural disturbances were abundant. When available, grizzly bears were more likely to select for natural disturbances compared to harvested locations, especially during Hypophagia (spring) and Hyperphagia (fall). Selection of harvested locations was inversely related to forest recovery assessed by spectral analysis and decreased sharply 15-20 years post-harvest, at which point it tended to be lower than pre-disturbance. This study demonstrates the utility of vegetation, disturbance, and recovery metrics derived from satellite time series for enriching our understanding of wildlife habitat selection in dynamic landscapes. Our results also have implications for forest management in regions where grizzly bear habitat availability and selection patterns are important. While rapid forest recovery following harvest is desirable and beneficial for a multitude of ecological and economic objectives, it appears to minimize the period of attractive early-seral habitat for grizzly bears.

TI  - Assessment Of Impacts Of Land Use/Land Cover Changes Upstream Of A Dam In A Semi-Arid Watershed Using Qswat
JO  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - The study of hydrodynamic responses of the watershed influenced by the changes occurring in the climate and pattern of land use is vital in the management of sustainable water resources. The open-source soil and water assessment tool QSWAT has been adopted in this study to link the meteorological factors with land-surface hydrology and present a complete response of an ungauged watershed in the Krishna basin. The main objective of the present work is to assess the adaptability of the QSWAT model for the selected semi-arid watershed, which has undergone drastic land use/land cover (LULC) changes due to the construction of a dam. The impact of the LULC changes on the hydrodynamic response of the watershed is analysed. For automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis, SUFI-2 algorithm is used. Initially, the model adaptability for the watershed is assessed by simulating for 32 years, of which 27 years (from 1982 to 2008) are used for calibration and 5 years (from 2008 to 2013) for validation. Further, Landsat satellite images along with 14 LULC classifications for the year 1998 and 2009, indicating scenarios of pre- and post-construction of the dam, respectively, are used as input to QSWAT to analyse the influence of LULC changes on the water balance components. The comparison indicates decrease in the agricultural area, barren land and urban built-up area. The annual water yield and surface runoff of the watershed have been reduced by 28.97\% and 29.91\%, respectively. An increment of 6\% evapotranspiration loss with a decreasing trend in rainfall is noted which is alarming. The simulated results indicate that the hydrological responses are influenced by the LULC changes. The basin LULC and hydrological components have been affected by the storage reservoir created due to the dam. The QSWAT seems to be reliable tool as there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed flows. The obtained model performance indices: the NSE andR(2)calibration values are 0.89 and 0.96, respectively, and the values for validation are 0.79 and 0.83 respectively, hence indicating a strong and predictive capability of the model to the ungauged watersheds with drastic LULC changes. Apart from establishing sustainable water resources management techniques in the watershed, there is a stressing need for such analysis before any human intervention into the natural system like construction of dams.

TI  - Detecting Major Phenological Stages Of Rice Using Modis-Evi Data And Symlet11 Wavelet In Northeast China
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2012
AB  - Plant phenology refers to the emergence of an annual cycle of natural phenomena in plants affected by climate and other environmental factors. Information of crop phenology can directly reflect the effect of temperature and precipitation on the crop, which is essential for evaluating crop growth, productivity and crop management. Remote sensing technique is an important method to detect vegetation phenology with high spatial-temporal scales. Vegetation index generated by infrared and near-infrared band based on satellite remotely sensed data can reflect the status of vegetation growth and coverage more accurately. The Northeast China includes Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which rice area accounts for about 10% of total rice area and its rice yield accounts for 11% of total rice yield in China. Rice planting in Northeast China plays an important role in China's food safety. In this study, we developed a method for detecting phenological stages of rice in Northeast China based on the EOS-MODIS multi-temporal remote sensing data, including MOD09A1 and MCD12Q1 in 2008. The rice crop phenological stages were detected by using EOS-MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, and compared with the observed rice phenological stages in 24 selected agro-meteorological sites in Northeast China. The method consists of four procedures: (1) calculating the EVI value and extracting time profile from the location where 24 selected sites through MODIS-EVI data; (2) filtering the noise in EVI time profile by wavelet transform with twenty six types of wavelets; (3) identifying the rice planting date, heading date and ripening date by the variation characteristics in the smoothed EVI time profile; (4) comparing the result calculated by this method with the observed data from the 24 agro-meteorological sites in study area in 2008 and calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), then choosing the best type of wavelets. Due to the temporal resolution of the MODIS/Terra is 8 days, there will be missing data in the EVI time profile. The cubic spline interpolated (CSI) method (more smoother and stabler) was applied to repair the missing data, which can reflect the missing data more authentic. The twenty six types of wavelet: Daubechies(7-20), Coiflet(3-5) and Symlet(7-15) were used when filtering EVI time profile. The results showed that, the case using Symlet11 shows a remarkably good result in determining phenological stages, which is compared with the observed data. Most of the RMSE in planting date were less than 16 days. Most of the RMSE in heading date and ripening date were less than 8 days. It was shown that the Symlet11 filtering is the best method, which can be used to detect rice phenology in Northeast China. Furthermore, the Symlet11 filtering can be used to analyze variations and distribution of rice phenology with high-spatial scale in the whole Northeast China.

TI  - Analysis Of Regional Economic Development Based On Remote Sensing Images
PY  - 2018
AB  - As the carrier of economic activities, land resource is an indispensable production factor of economic development. Economic growth leads to increased demand for land and changes in land utilization form. Therefore, changes in land use and land cover can reflect regional economic development situations to some extent. This paper proposed a method to predict regional economic situations based on remote sensing images, in which land use and land cover data is extracted by remote sensing images classification. Taking Zhoushan City as study area, the land use and land cover information from 2000 to 2015 was obtained through Landsat satellite images and then was used to construct regional economic development prediction models for 7 economic indexes. The results showed that the prediction errors of gross domestic product, products of primary industry, products of secondary industry, products of tertiary industry, fixed assets investment, gross output value of fisheries, and total tourist income are 7.8\%, 9.11\%, 6.93\%, 7.74\%, 15.31\%, 7.29\%, 11.76\%, respectively.

TI  - Obcd-Hh: An Object-Based Change Detection Approach Using Multi-Feature Non-Seed-Based Region Growing Segmentation
JO  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is an increasing need to get updated information regarding the changes on earth's surface. The information obtained can be used in a wide range of applications including disaster management, land-use investigation etc. The high-resolution remote sensing images obtained from satellites provide us with an opportunity to detect changes on earth's surface between various time intervals. In this paper, an unsupervised object-based change detection (OBCD) method is proposed to detect changes in high resolution bi-temporal satellite images. To detect changes, a novel multi-feature non-seed-based region growing (MF-NSRG) algorithm is proposed for image segmentation based on heterogeneity minimization that uses textural heterogeneity along with spectral and spatial heterogeneity during region growing. The performance of MF-NSRG algorithm is further improved by using Harris Hawk, a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm, which is used to obtain optimal values of segmentation parameters. Finally, the feature maps extracted from the pre-change and post-change segmented images are analysed using histogram trend similarity (HTS) approach to detect changes. The proposed approach is known as object-based change detection using Harris Hawk (OBCD-HH). The proposed OBCD-HH approach is applied on two datasets: xBD and Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset. Its performance is compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms and results show the superiority of the proposed approach.

TI  - Effects Of Building Density On Land Surface Temperature In China: Spatial Patterns And Determinants
JO  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
PY  - 2020
AB  - The effects of building density on land surface temperature (LST) and its spatial patterns remain poorly understood over large areas. Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, we quantified the effects of building density on land surface temperature (K) across 21 cities in China and analysed their spatial patterns, possible factors, and mechanisms. Results showed that the effects of building density on LST were more significant in areas with dry climates compared to humid climates. The spatial variability in the effects of building density on LST was closely related to climate conditions, soil type, and vegetation. The results from stepwise regression analysis showed that precipitation (climate) controlled the spatial variability, indicating that there is a complex mechanism underlying these potential factors. Furthermore, the results from climatic zoning statistics revealed that the K-values of northern Chinese cities were positively correlated with the areas of local water bodies. However, the K-values of southern Chinese cities were significantly and positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity and were negatively correlated with population density. Stepwise regression results further indicated that the mean annual temperature may be the most influential factor for southern cities. These results highlight the spatial variance and different determinants of K and suggest that climate-adapted urban design and planning standards are needed in different climate zones.

TI  - Towards Risk-Based Flood Management In Highly Productive Paddy Rice Cultivation-Concept Development And Application To The Mekong Delta
JO  - Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences
PY  - 2018
AB  - Flooding is an imminent natural hazard threatening most river deltas, e.g. the Mekong Delta. An appropriate flood management is thus required for a sustainable development of the often densely populated regions. Recently, the traditional event-based hazard control shifted towards a risk management approach in many regions, driven by intensive research leading to new legal regulation on flood management. However, a large-scale flood risk assessment does not exist for the Mekong Delta. Particularly, flood risk to paddy rice cultivation, the most important economic activity in the delta, has not been performed yet. Therefore, the present study was developed to provide the very first insight into delta-scale flood damages and risks to rice cultivation. The flood hazard was quantified by probabilistic flood hazard maps of the whole delta using a bivariate extreme value statistics, synthetic flood hydrographs, and a large-scale hydraulic model. The flood risk to paddy rice was then quantified considering cropping calendars, rice phenology, and harvest times based on a time series of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MODIS satellite data, and a published rice flood damage function. The proposed concept provided flood risk maps to paddy rice for the Mekong Delta in terms of expected annual damage. The presented concept can be used as a blueprint for regions facing similar problems due to its generic approach. Furthermore, the changes in flood risk to paddy rice caused by changes in land use currently under discussion in the Mekong Delta were estimated. Two land-use scenarios either intensifying or reducing rice cropping were considered, and the changes in risk were presented in spatially explicit flood risk maps. The basic risk maps could serve as guidance for the authorities to develop spatially explicit flood management and mitigation plans for the delta. The land-use change risk maps could further be used for adaptive risk management plans and as a basis for a cost-benefit of the discussed land-use change scenarios. Additionally, the damage and risks maps may support the recently initiated agricultural insurance programme in Vietnam. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Man's activity in space has generated significant amounts of debris that remain in orbit for periods of sufficient duration to become a hazard to future space activities. In the past, the debris has been generated by inadvertent explosions of upper stages and spacecraft, by intentional explosions for military reasons, and possibly by a few breakups resulting from collisions. In the future, debris can be generated by collisions among spacecraft as the number of orbital objects continues to grow at rates greater than natural forces remove them from orbit. There are design and operations practices that can minimize the inadvertent generation of debris. There are other design and operations options for removing objects from space at the end of their useful service so they are not available as a source for the generation of future debris. Those studies are the primary concern of this paper. The issues are different in the low Earth orbits and in the geosynchronous orbits. In low Earth orbit, the hazards generated by potential collisions among spacecraft are severe because the events would take place at such high velocities. In geosynchronous orbit, the collision consequence is not so severe, because the relative velocities are low- < 1 km/s. But, because of the value of the limited arc and the extremely long lifetime of the satellites, it is necessary to remove any debris generated in the orbit to a different orbit at the end of life if it is to be no hazard to future operational spacecraft. The issue at present seems to be how high the reboost maneuver must be and what the maneuver strategy should be to ensure its effectiveness. The most economic removal of objects is achieved when those objects have the capability to execute the necessary maneuvers with their own systems and resources. The most costly option is to have some other system remove the spacecraft after it has become a derelict. Numerous options are being studied to develop systems and techniques that can remove spacecraft from useful orbits at the end of their useful life and do so for the least mass penalty and economic cost. © 1992.

TI  - Predictive Habitat Modeling Of Rare Plant Species In Pacific Northwest Forests
JO  - Western Journal of Applied Forestry
PY  - 2011
AB  - Certification requirements associated with the Sustainable Forestry Initiative include efforts to identify and protect occurrences of endangered plant species. Habitat models were constructed in this study using maximum entropy and random forest algorithms to generate independent predictions for four selected rare plants, Castilleja chambersii, Erythronium elegans, Filipendula occidentalis, and Sidalcea nelsoniana, associated with divergent physical environments. Explanatory variables used to model rare plant occurrence included Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus spectral imagery, spectral-based vegetation indices, climatic data, and several terrain variables derived from a digital elevation model. Models were trained with known occurrence records obtained from the Oregon Biodiversity Information Center. Subsequent field surveys were conducted to acquire randomly located test data for comparative model evaluation. A range of accuracy statistics was computed that indicated generally high prediction accuracy for both methods. Model performance was highest for species with narrow, well-defined ecological requirements at scales comparable to the resolution of the calibration data. Species with relatively broad ecological distributions or with extremely specific habitat requirements were less accurately predicted. Random forest-based models generally produced higher rates of prediction success than maximum entropy when model performance was limited by the ecology of a species. Field surveys identified 22 previously unknown populations of the target rare plants, suggesting the efficacy of habitat models for predicting rare species occurrence and their utility as a prescriptive tool for land management planning.

TI  - Downscaling Wghm-Based Groundwater Storage Using Random Forest Method: A Regional Study Over Qazvin Plain, Iran
JO  - HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Climate change, urbanization, and a growing population have led to a rapid increase in groundwater (GW) use. As a result, monitoring groundwater changes is essential for water managers and decision-makers. Due to the lack of reliable and insufficient in situ information, remote sensing and hydrological models may be counted as alternative sources to assess GW storage changes on regional and global scales. However, often, these hydrological models have a low spatial resolution for water-related applications on a small scale. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to downscale the GW storage anomaly (GWSA) of the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) from a coarse (0.5 degrees) to a finer spatial resolution (0.1 degrees) using fine spatial resolution auxiliary datasets (0.1 degrees), such as evaporation (E), surface (SRO), subsurface runoff (SSRO), snow depth (SD), and volumetric soil water (SWVL), from the ERA5-Land model, as well as the global precipitation (Pre) measurement (GPM-IMERG) product. The Qazvin Plain in central Iran was selected as the case study region, as it faces a severe decline in GW resources. Different statistical regression models were tested for the GWSA downscaling to find the most suitable method. Moreover, since different water budget components (such as precipitation or storage) are known to have temporal lead or lag relative to each other, the approach also incorporates a time shift factor. The most suitable regression model with the highest skill score during the training-validation was selected and applied to predict the final 0.1-degree GWSA. The downscaled results showed high agreement with the in situ groundwater levels over the Qazvin Plain on both interannual and monthly time scales, with a correlation coefficient of 0.989 and 0.62, respectively. Moreover, the downscaled product represents clear proof that the developed downscaling technique is able to learn from high-resolution auxiliary data to capture GWSA features at a higher spatial resolution. The major benefit of the proposed method lies in the utilization of only the auxiliary data that are available with global coverage and are free of charge, while not requiring in situ GW records for training or prediction. Therefore, the proposed downscaling technique can potentially be applied at a global scale and to aquifers in other geographical regions.

TI  - Methodology Of Geoinformation Mapping Of Natural Recreational Resources Of The North Caucasus For Tourism Development
JO  - InterCarto, InterGIS
PY  - 2020
AB  - The relationship of natural components with the organization of tourism as a type of economic activity is shown. Recommendations are formulated on the selection of indicators of natural components to be assessed when planning the organization of recreational activities. The assessment of natural resources by the methods of constructing mathematical-cartographic models. Evaluation of each parameter was both functional and aesthetic parameters. The biological diversity of vegetation was calculated by identifying polygon heights and slope exposures according to SRTM data. The relief analysis was carried out according to two parameters: absolute altitudes above sea level and the nature of dissection. The calculation of the absolute heights is prepared by the method of constructing a cartogram by analyzing the quantitative value of points. The calculation of the terrain relief is prepared by the method of constructing a cartogram by calculating the sum of the distances of isolines in the polygon. Cartograms of the density of the river network, the area and the number of water bodies were constructed. The numerical data of the natural components forming the recreational potential of the territory are obtained. An integral assessment of the North Caucasus on the availability and use of natural and recreational resources by adding the numerical values of the individual components in the aisles of the minimum territorial unit is carried out. As a result of the work by geoinformation methods, the zones of the greatest and smallest concentration of natural resources for the organization of tourist activity were determined. In the Western Caucasus, the zones of the highest concentration of natural resources (4, 5 points) for the organization of tourism are located within the Black Sea and Azov coasts in the Greater Sochi region, as well as the southern tip of the Republic of Adygea located on the spurs of a rocky ridge. The lowest mark (1, 2 points) was received by the northern regions of the Krasnodar Territory, located in the steppe, forest-steppe zones, subject to agricultural development and extensive land cultivation. Within the Central Caucasus, the zones with the highest rating are located in the foothills of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, in the mid-mountain areas within the Lateral and Rocky Ranges. On the territory of the Eastern Caucasus, zones with a rating of 4, 5 points are located within the Bogos and Samur ranges. Broad-leaved forests prevail on this territory, turning into subalpine meadows with rich species diversity. © 2020 Lomonosov Moscow State University. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation And Implication Of The Policies Towards China’s Carbon Neutrality
JO  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
PY  - 2023
AB  - China announced it will achieve a carbon emission peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 to fulfill its international obligations and mitigate climate risk. Related activities and polices were introduced in several sectors before this announcement. The performance and outcome of these activities provide necessary a priori knowledge for the designation and optimization of future policies. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation covering major sectors based on multisource data is proposed. The results show that although China is the largest CO2 emitter for the current stage, the increasing rate of carbon emissions has been significantly mitigated since the 2010s. This reduction in emissions can be accelerated by the carbon-trading scheme in pilot regions. As a substitution for fossil energy, there have been tens of thousands of increases in wind turbines and photovoltaic plants in the past decade. Additionally, an enhancement of the terrestrial carbon sink was detected by time-series remote sensing data. The results of this study demonstrate that China’s carbon activities in the past decade have received reasonable outcomes, which will benefit the optimization of related government policies. The improved legislation and policies of China can strengthen the regulation of emissions while promoting the quantity and quality of carbon sinks. At the same time, the improvement of the carbon emissions trading mechanism, especially the establishment of a marketing regulation mechanism, can significantly motivate interest-related communities and industries to abort high-carbon emissions and ensure the implementation of carbon neutrality in the future. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Performance Evaluation Of Satellite-Based Rainfall Products Over Nigeria
JO  - CLIMATE
PY  - 2020
AB  - Understanding the variability of rainfall is important for sustaining rain-dependent agriculture and driving the local economy of Nigeria. Paucity and inadequate rain gauge network across Nigeria has made satellite-based rainfall products (SRPs), which offer a complete spatial and consistent temporal coverage, a better alternative. However, the accuracy of these products must be ascertained before use in water resource developments and planning. In this study, the performances of Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), were evaluated to investigate their ability to reproduce long term (1983-2013) observed rainfall characteristics derived from twenty-four (24) gauges in Nigeria. Results show that all products performed well in terms of capturing the observed annual cycle and spatial trends in all selected stations. Statistical evaluation of the SRPs performance show that CHIRPS agree more with observations in all climatic zones by reproducing the local rainfall characteristics. The performance of PERSIANN and TAMSAT, however, varies with season and across the climatic zones. Findings from this study highlight the benefits of using SRPs to augment or fill gaps in the distribution of local rainfall data, which is critical for water resources planning, agricultural development, and policy making.

TI  - Fishery Resource Evaluation In Shantou Seas Based On Remote Sensing And Hydroacoustics
JO  - FISHES
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Shantou-Taiwan shoal fishing ground in southeastern China supports a significant population of pelagic fish, which play a key role in the marine ecosystem. An acoustic survey was carried out using a digital scientific echosounder in June 2019. In this paper, the spatial distribution of pelagic fish is analyzed based on acoustic data using geostatistical analysis tools. Meanwhile, the relationship between fish density from acoustic data and sea surface environment factors were evaluated by using generalized additive models (GAMs) based on the satellite-based oceanographic data of sea surface temperature, sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface height and sea surface wind. The results showed the following: (1) Fish density and acoustic biomass have strong spatial correlation; the optimal model for acoustic biomass is exponential and the optimal model for fish density is gaussian; based on optimal model, spatial interpolation analysis of fish density and acoustic biomass was performed using the ordinary kriging method, and the higher values of density and acoustic biomass were located in the central and eastern parts of the study area. The total fish density and acoustic biomass is 2.56 x 10(10) ind. and 1908.99 m(2)/m, respectively. (2) In vertical distribution, fish gradually move to the middle and lower layers of water during daytime, and gather in the middle and upper layers of water at night. (3) The variance explanation rate of GAM was 88.2\% which indicates that the model has an excellent fitting degree, and the results of GAM showed that longitude, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface wind (SSW), and sea surface height (SSH) had significant effects on fish density. Results of this study were meaningful for understanding the distribution of fishery resources, and as a guide for fish management in the Shantou offshore water.

TI  - Peat Consumption And Carbon Loss Due To Smouldering Wildfire In A Temperate Peatland
JO  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2013
AB  - Temperate peatlands represent a substantial store of carbon and their degradation is a potentially significant positive feedback to climate change. The ignition of peat deposits can cause smouldering wildfires that have the potential to release substantial amounts of carbon and to cause environmental damage from which ecosystem recovery can be slow. Direct estimates of the loss of carbon due to smouldering wildfires are needed to inform global estimates of the effect of wildfire on carbon dynamics and to aid with national emissions accounting. We surveyed the effect of a severe wildfire that burnt within an afforested peatland in the Scottish Highlands during the summer of 2006. The fire ignited layers of peat which continued to burn as a sub-surface smouldering wildfire for more than a month after the initial surface fire and despite several episodes of heavy rain. The smouldering fire perimeter enclosed an area of 4.1 ha. Analysis of weather records showed that the fire coincided with unusually warm, dry conditions and a period when the Canadian Fire Weather Index system predicted both generally high danger conditions (high Fire Weather Index) and low fuel moisture content in deep organic soil layers (high Drought Code values). Remaining peat layers in the burn area had comparatively low fuel moisture contents of ca. 250\% dry weight. Within the smouldering fire's perimeter, mean depth of burn was estimated at 17.5 +/- 2.0 cm but ranged from 1 to 54 cm. Based on field measurements, our estimates suggested that, in total, the smouldering wildfire burnt 773 +/- 120 t of organic matter corresponding to 396 +/- 63 t of carbon and a carbon loss per unit area burnt of 96 +/- 15 t ha(-1) (9.6 +/- 1.5 kg m(-2)). This corresponds to between 0.1\% and 0.3\% of the estimated total amount of carbon sequestered annually by UK peatlands. Our results also provide circumstantial evidence that afforestation of peatland soils, and associated site preparation, may contribute to an increased risk of peat fires. Smouldering fires are difficult to detect using remotely sensing techniques due to their low temperature and low heat release and the fact that the tree canopy remains intact for months afterwards. If similar smouldering fires are underreported in other temperate, boreal and tropical peatland regions then emissions from peatland burning may well be a substantially greater issue than currently assumed.

TI  - Three Years Of Mapping Irrigation Water In The Flumen Irrigation District, Spain
PY  - 2000
AB  - A methodology to estimate and map irrigation water volumes is presented. The information used was: (i) crop maps obtained by supervised classification of satellite images; (ii) net water requirements obtained by FAO method from meteorological data; (iii) soil maps; and (iv) irrigation efficiency values. From these data we obtained several graphical and numerical documents related to irrigation water in 1993, 1994 and 1996 in the Flumen district (Spain). After our estimations in the three studied years, the irrigation patterns were quite stable both in the whole irrigated district and by morphopedological unit. The method can be applied in other irrigated areas and will be useful for agricultural and environmental management.

TI  - For A Better Quality Of Beef: The Challenge From Growing Livestock On Limited Grasslands With A Production–Consumption Balance Perspective
JO  - Foods
PY  - 2023
AB  - The growing population, the transition dietary towards animal-based products, and the preference for the brand of grass-feeding livestock are bringing increasing pressure on natural grasslands, especially for dry-land areas. The Xilingol League of China is famous for its free-range livestock product, however, overgrazing and herders’ benefits damage are always serious issues for this semi-arid grassland region. This study focuses on the relationship between the supply of natural grassland and the consumption of free-range livestock in the Xilingol League, and this study employed the grassland carrying capacity as the index to judge the sustainability states and its trends of the local grass-feeding system. Satellite data production of net primary production was used for grassland production, statistical livestock data and the consumption model were used for actual forage consumption, and empirical key informant interview data were used to obtain a more comprehensive understanding. The results show that: (1) the natural grassland carrying capacity of the Xilingol League fluctuated, showing improvement from 2000 to 2021; (2) the grassland management needs to be more diversified in different regions with different natural conditions; and (3) while the demand for free-range, high-quality beef is increasing, attention should be paid to the carrying capacity of natural pastures and more consideration should be taken of the benefits of balancing the livelihood of herders, policy strategies, and the customers’ preferences. Potential ways of doing this include employing technologies to improve livestock production, and further exploring and promoting the economic value of the free-range livestock and the geographical indication to get the economic–ecological win-win situation. The research framework and results would be beneficial to reveal the potential threats in pastoral areas and provide support for the optimization of the regional grass-feeding breeding system, especially in middle-income countries. © 2023 by the authors.

JO  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
PY  - 2019
AB  - Field-based high throughput plant phenotyping has recently gained increased interest in the efforts to bridge the genotyping and phenotyping gap and accelerate plant breeding for crop improvement. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, integrated robotic cable-driven sensing system developed at University of Nebraska for field phenotyping research. It is constructed to collect data from a 0.4 ha field. The system has a sensor payload of 30 kg and offers the flexibility to integrate user defined sensing modules. Currently it integrates a four-band multispectral camera, a thermal infrared camera, a 3D scanning LiDAR, and a portable visible near-infrared spectrometer for plant measurements. Software is designed and developed for instrument control, task planning, and motion control, which enables precise and flexible phenotypic data collection at the plot level. The system also includes a variable-rate subsurface drip irrigation to control water application rates, and an automated weather station to log environmental variables. The system has been in operation for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. We demonstrate that the system is reliable and robust, and that fully automated data collection is feasible. Sensor and image data are of high quality in comparison to the ground truth measurements, and capture various aspects of plant traits such as height, ground cover and spectral reflectance. We present two novel datasets enabled by the system, including a plot-level thermal infrared image time-series during a day, and the signal of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence from canopy reflectance. It is anticipated that the availability of this automated phenotyping system will benefit research in field phenotyping, remote sensing, agronomy, and related disciplines.

TI  - Understanding The Changes Of Optically Active Substances (Oacs) In Hulun Lake In The Past 35 Years And Its Indication To The Degradation Of Aquatic Ecology
JO  - Journal of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2022
AB  - Lake eutrophication and ecological degradation are among the most serious environmental problems in the world and identifying changes in key water quality parameters and associated drivers is critical for lake management. Optically active substances (OACs) are important water quality indicators that affect lake water ecology and evaluate lake eutrophication. Climate change and human activities are important factors driving the changes of OACs in lakes. Understanding how and why OACs varies in long-term trend in response to different influencing factors and its driving mechanism is needed to understand. In this study, based on the Landsat series satellite data, this study investigated the historical changes of OACs in Hulun Lake, quantitatively explained the response relationship of OACs to meteorological, hydrological and human activity elements, and discussed their indicative role in the degradation of water ecology. The results showed that during 1986–2020, OACs had obvious periodic changes; from 1986 to 1999, Chla, CDOM and TSM are relatively stable at lower values; during 2000–2009, the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) increased, and the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chla) decreased; during 2010–2020 The annual TSM and CDOM concentration decreased, and the Chla concentration increased. The results showed that among the hydrometeorological and anthropogenic variables selected to explain changes in the OAC, gross domestic product (GDP) is the key factor influencing changes in the OACs, explaining 39.3%, 71.8% and 60.6% of the changes in Chla, CDOM and TSM, respectively. Air temperature (AT) can explain 24.0% of the variation in Chla, evapotranspiration (Eva) can explain 19.1% and 5.52% of the variation in CDOM and TSM, and precipitation (P) can explain 13.8% and 7.5% of the variation in Chla and TSM. Water level is an important pathway affecting OACs in Hulun Lake, explaining 50.7% of the variation in CDOM, 48.0% of the variation in TSM and 23.1% of the variation in Chla. Warming and drought in the Hulun Lake basin and human activities ultimately lead to changes in OACs. Finally, a pattern diagram to assess the degree of ecological degradation of lake was proposed. This study has substantial implications to monitor and assess the ecological degradation status of lake and maintain the sustainable development of lakes in cold and arid regions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessment Of Coastal Strandveld Integrity Using Worldview-2 Imagery In False Bay, South Africa
JO  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
PY  - 2018
AB  - The coastal zone as interface between land and sea faces much pressure from human activities. These pressures make it difficult for the coastal zones to fulfil their natural functions, so threatening the state of coastal environments and making them vulnerable to coastal disasters and degradation. This study aimed to test whether high resolution remote sensing imagery can be used to assess the integrity of coastal Strandveld vegetation at the high spatial resolution required as baseline information for local environmental management. The study focused on the Cape Flats Dune Strandveld vegetation in northern False Bay near Cape Town, South Africa. The approach modifies and adopts a method developed by Liick-Vogel et al. (2013) for a remote sensing derived habitat intactness assessment for the Sandveld region at South Africa's west coast. A regression analysis was performed on the eight spectral bands of two WorldView-2 images and five image derivatives to evaluate the most suitable bands for producing an ecosystem integrity index. Based on the results, only the RED and NIR bands were required to perform a decision tree classification for the integrity classification, which significantly simplifies the application and opens the way for transfer to sensors with similar spectral bands. The overall accuracy of the results was 80.5\% with a kappa value of 0.75. This means that this approach provides results accurate enough for coastal management and conservation applications at a local scale. A further finding is the importance of seasonality to delineate natural and alien vegetation accurately. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Potential Of Earth Observation For The Analysis Of Cold Region Land Surface Dynamics In Europe-A Review
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2017
AB  - Cold regions affect global, regional and local climate; oftentimes they are relevant for water supply, host valuable ecosystems, and support human livelihood. They are thus eminently important for human society. In the context of ongoing climate change, monitoring and understanding cold region land surface dynamics is essential for environmental scientists, stakeholders and decision makers. However, the definition of cold regions remains inexplicit, and no up-to-date cold region maps or overarching spatial analyses exist. For example, Europe has densely populated cold regions, but hardly an article exists that provides a solid overview of Earth Observation (EO) based applications assessing cold region land surface dynamics in Europe. With this review article we aim at closing this gap by providing an overview of EO-based techniques for cold region observation in Europe, focusing on the dynamics of glaciers and snow. We present a novel spatial delineation of cold regions for Europe before analyzing the benefits and limitations of different EO sensor types and data processing methods for EO based cold region research. Furthermore, we identify research gaps and discuss challenges for future studies.

TI  - Green Open Spaces Management Based On Mangrove Ecosystem As A Mitigation Of Greenhouse Gases In Tallo River Area Of Makassar City
JO  - Jurnal Pengelolaan Sumberdaya Alam dan Lingkungan
PY  - 2020
AB  - One of the ecological functions of mangroves ecosystem is to store carbon. Yet, on the other hand it is potentially to cause greenhouse gas emissions through litter degradation even though its value is lower compared to the absorption value. Based on these two facts, mangrove management as a Green Open Space in the Tallo River area of Makassar City needs to consider involving the participation of the community and the government as stakeholders. This study aimed to analyze the carbon adsorbance and global warming potential of the mangrove ecosystem as a basis for managing green open spaces in Makassar City. The research was conducted by desk work, literature study and respondent interviews regarding perceptions and participation in mangrove management. The results showed that the total uptake of mangrove carbon in the Tallo River in Makassar city was 351.02 tons CO2/ha, oxygen supply 255.29 O2-equivalent/ha, and the potential for global warming was 252.41 mg/ m2/hour consisting of 194.33 mg/m2/hour of CO2 gas, 15.76 mg/m2/hour of CH4 gas, and 42.33 mg/m2/hour of N2O gas. The results of community perception and participation analysis show that around 89% of the community strongly agreed and supported the government in the effort to manage mangroves as a green open space. Based on these facts, the ecosystem in Tallo river is very suitable to manage for green open space as fresh air supplier and CO2 adsorber as well as a noise reduction from vehicle or industrial engines in Makassar city. © 2020, Pusat Penelitian Lingkungan Hidup - Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat Institut Pertanian Bogor (PPLH-LPPM IPB).

TI  - Design Of Farm Waste-Driven Supply Side Infrastructure For Data Centers
JO  - HP Laboratories Technical Report
PY  - 2011
AB  - In this paper, we design a supply-side infrastructure for data centers that runs primarily on energy from digested farm waste. Although the information technology and livestock industries may seem completely disjoint, they have complementary characteristics that we exploit for mutual benefit. In particular, the farm waste fuels a combined heat and power system. The data center consumes the power, and its waste heat feeds back into the combined system. We propose a resource management system to manage the resource flows and effluents, and evaluate the direct and indirect economic benefits. As an example, we explain how a hypothetical farm of 10,000 dairy cows could fulfill the power requirements of a 1MW data center. © Copyright ASME 2010.

TI  - Value Of Insar For Monitoring Land Subsidence To Support Water Management In The San Joaquin Valley, California
JO  - Journal of the American Water Resources Association
PY  - 2022
AB  - Land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction in California’s San Joaquin Valley has been occurring for many decades. In situ monitoring of subsidence in this large geographic area has historically been limited. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) sought the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s assistance for satellite- and aircraft-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) monitoring of subsidence during the 2012–2016 drought. InSAR was successful in cost-effectively providing first-ever synoptic measurement of land subsidence over the entire San Joaquin Valley. The purpose of the monitoring was screening or hotspot detection of impact areas affecting critical water infrastructure. Long-term cumulative land subsidence has substantially reduced the conveyance capacity of sections of major valley canals and the monitoring revealed that subsidence rates observed during the drought ranked with maximum historically observed rates, highlighting risks to water infrastructure. InSAR also identified new and rapidly emerging hotspots adjacent to critical water infrastructure. The success of the InSAR monitoring for drought response resulted in CDWR’s decision to subsequently provide InSAR data as technical assistance to local agencies required to comply with recent state groundwater management legislation. © 2021 American Water Resources Association.

TI  - A New Generation Of Tabs Ii Buoy For The Texas Automated Buoy System
JO  - Proceedings of MTS/IEEE OCEANS, 2005
PY  - 2005
AB  - The year 2005 marks the tenth anniversary of the Texas Automated Buoy System (TABS). The buoy network was developed for the Texas General Lands Office (TGLO) in support of oil spill modeling, mitigation and response in the Gulf of Mexico. The government of Texas, and in particular the TGLO have supported the TABS program since its inception in 1995 at seven locations in the Gulf of Mexico. The program currently has nine locations with the two additional sites receiving support through a joint industry project supported by a consortium of oil companies operating in the Flower Garden Banks region of the gulf. The initial buoy systems were developed by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG) of Texas A&M University (TAMU) with the Woods Hole Group (WHG) of Falmouth, MA to measure and report near real time surface currents through cellular and satellite telemetry. Since the initial development in 1995, the buoy systems have evolved to include additional sensors such as ADCP's, CTD's, optical sensors, meteorological sensors, GPS, various means of telemetry and most recently, seafloor mounted sensors. In early 2003, GERG began to explore the means by which the TABS network could accommodate additional sensors to expand and enhance the data capability and data value to the end users, increase reliability, provide a faster turn around time during routine servicing and provide modularity in terms of both hardware and software. Because the TABS buoys are a spar design with limited power and space, choice of the right controller was critical. The TABS controller hardware was upgraded from a Motorola 68332 processor based system, to a more powerful PC104 computer system operating at 100 MHz, with 12 serial ports, 16 analog ports, 24 digital I/O's, 2 USB ports and fast Ethernet. The computer and peripherals operate at approximately 3 watts on a 12 volt supply making it suitable for long term deployments with a solar charging system. The CPU runs on a Linux operating system with high level software written Perl and modular sensor support written in C. The new buoys offer much greater flexibility in terms of the type and quantity of sensors the buoy can support, overall processing speed and capability, internal diagnostic capability, as well as the ability to safely handle remote software upgrades without danger of catastrophic failure if the upgrade is corrupted through telemetry. In February 2005 the first of the new generation buoys was deployed off of San Louis Pass located south west of Galveston, Texas. During this deployment new systems and sensors were tested including the ability of a TABS buoy to acoustically collect processed wave data from a bottom mounted wave gauge ADCP. The recent addition of wave capability to the TABS network enhances the data currently available to the end users of the TABS observing network.

TI  - A Contextual And Multitemporal Active-Fire Detection Algorithm Based On Fengyun-2g S-Vissr Data
JO  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Wildfires are one of the most destructive disasters on the planet. They also significantly impact the land surface. Satellite data have been widely used to detect the outbreak and monitor the expansion of fire incidents for damage assessment and disaster management. Polar-orbiting satellite data have been used for several decades but data from geostationary satellites, which can provide observations with a high temporal resolution, have received much less attention. This paper utilizes data from FengYun-2G, a Chinese geostationary satellite, to detect wildfires in two selected research regions in January 2016. The detection algorithm systemizes image-based analysis to filter out obvious nonfire pixels and temporal analysis to confirm the true detections. Fire detection is based on comparisons between predicted and observed values. The results show that the proposed method has some advantages compared with the use of polar-orbiting satellite data, including early detection and continuous observation. The validation work is conducted based on the collection 6.1 Global Monthly Fire Location Product generated from fire detections by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. The average accuracy within the target time is 56, while the omission error rate is over 78. In detail, the algorithm has a lower omission error rate in Australia while it fails in detecting most of the fire pixels in India. The dominance of small fire incidents, as well as low spatial resolution greatly limit the detection ability. Many small fires were beyond the ability of Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR) data when no significant fire characteristics could be captured. Future development of the algorithm will focus on improving the results by enhancing the adaption to different regions, as well as, including multisource data sets.

TI  - Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Of Extremes In Conus With Radar Data
JO  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale, long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern United States. Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event, such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term, high-resolution precipitation data set.

TI  - Risk Assessment Of Mountain Tourism On The Western Sichuan Plateau, China
JO  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - As an important site for tourism activities, mountainous areas may generate greater tourism risks than plain areas due to potential natural disasters, social issues, scenic area management, and tourist behavior. Western Sichuan Plateau is mostly mountainous area and tourism is its pillar industry, Therefore, the assessment of the tourism risks on the Western Sichuan Plateau is of academic value and practical significance. In this study, we use statistical and remote sensing data, fishbone diagram, and the entropy weighting method to construct a tourism risk evaluation model and classify risks into different levels, and we also use a geographic information system (GIS) for spatial mapping to quantify and spatialize the results. The objectives are 1) to identify the risk sources in the Western Sichuan Plateau and analyze their causal mechanisms, precisely reveal the distribution of tourism risks in the study area; 2) improve the precision of tourism risk evaluation in scenic areas and analyze the causes and spatial distribution patterns of tourism risks and propose targeted management measures. This study found that the evaluation results of the four elements of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity on the Western Sichuan Plateau showed significant spatial variability, depending on the natural conditions and the quantity difference of tourism resources in different regions. In addition, the tourism risk is low in most areas of the Western Sichuan Plateau, and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity is higher in areas with high tourism risk where attractions are densely populated and tourism is concentrated. Our study can provide a reference for future analyses of tourism risks in mountainous tourist areas such as in China and worldwide.

PY  - 2014
AB  - The multiple ecosystem services provided by healthy soil are well known and include soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, a medium for plant and agricultural production and regulating the hydrologic cycle. Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of >0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. © 2015.

TI  - Building A Continental Scale Land Cover Monitoring Framework For Australia
JO  - European Space Agency, (Special Publication) ESA SP
PY  - 2012
AB  - Land cover information is critical for national reporting and decision making in Australia. A review of information requirements for reporting on national environmental indicators identified the need for consistent land cover information to be compared against a baseline. A Dynamic Land Cover Dataset (DLCD) for Australia has been developed by Geoscience Australia and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) recently, to provide a comprehensive and consistent land cover information baseline to enable monitoring and reporting for sustainable farming practices, water resource management, soil erosion, and forests at national and regional scales. The DLCD was produced from the analysis of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data at 250-metre resolution derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period from 2000 to 2008. The EVI time series data for each pixel was modelled as 12 coefficients based on the statistical, phenological and seasonal characteristics. The time series were then clustered in coefficients spaces and labelled using ancillary information on vegetation and land use at the catchment scale. The accuracy of the DLCD was assessed using field survey data over 25,000 locations provided by vegetation and land management agencies in State and Territory jurisdictions, and by ABARES. The DLCD is seen as the first in a series of steps to build a framework for national land cover monitoring in Australia. A robust methodology to provide annual updates to the DLCD is currently being developed at Geoscience Australia. There is also a growing demand from the user community for land cover information at better spatial resolution than currently available through the DLCD. Global land cover mapping initiatives that rely on Earth observation data offer many opportunities for national and international programs to work in concert and deliver better outcomes by streamlining efforts on development and validation of land cover products. Among the upcoming missions, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) Sentinel-2 satellites are seen as an important source of optical data for updating land cover information in Australia. This paper outlines the DLCD development, key applications that inform nationally significant issues, further work on updating the DLCD that would enable transition to a national land cover monitoring framework, challenges and approaches to delivering land cover information at higher spatial resolutions on a continental scale, and the potential value of data from the Sentinel-2 mission in supporting land cover monitoring in Australia and globally.

TI  - Reflection Of Eo Data In Blue Economy: Sustainable Growth
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is a reason that earth is called the Blue Planet. About 71% of the globe is covered by water which holds roughly 80% of the total life forms. More than 1/3 of the global population lives within 100 km of the sea, more than 3 billion people rely on water bodies for a living, and waterways carry out more than 78% of international trade in goods which creates the value of the ocean economy around 3 trillion USD annually. Along with transportation and tourism, new activities such as offshore wind energy, growing aquaculture and marine biotechnologies are accelerating the growth of the Blue economy. Globally, approximately 350 million jobs are linked to the oceans through aquaculture, fishing, coastal and marine research & tourism and activities. However, these activities are growing without sufficient consideration for sustainability and are often affected by climate change, ocean pollution and overfishing. These facts certainly bring much attention to the fact that thinking and acting blue is the future for our planet. The concept of the Blue Economy was introduced in 2010. Since then, it has been gaining popularity throughout the globe as we live in the 21st century where data is the new oil and becoming more and more important across multiple industries and at UN Climate Change Conference COP26 the ocean also became the fundamental part. Similarly, Earth Observation (EO) data became an essential source of information for the monitoring and modelling of oceanic, atmospheric and terrestrial processes. EO has the potential to support the Blue economy and address a wide range of issues, including disaster risk management, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation, coastal water safety and security, and short and long term planning challenges. This paper unfolds the opportunities for Earth Observation Data to provide innovative solutions to develop and secure Blue Growth and meet global sustainable development goals (SDGs) challenges. There is a long list of potential applications of EO in the maritime sector to increase information management, decision-making planning for coastal and marine resources management. The majority of these applications positively impact human activities on the earth. Also, this paper emphasises the global market trends of emerging sectors in the blue economy and how EO data is revolutionising them by efficient operations (using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep learning technologies) and ease of decision making.

TI  - A Novel Modelling Approach To The Identification Of Optimum Sites For The Placement Of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (Otec) Power Plant: Application To The Tropical Island Climate Of Mauritius
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
PY  - 2018
AB  - The geographical location of Mauritius near the warm tropical waters of the Indian Ocean coupled to the vast exclusive economic zone approximating 2.3 million square kilometers, encourage the promotion of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems. Technological advancements have enabled offshore structures to pump the cold water lying at 1000m depth in the seawater column to the surface, and through the temperature difference set up with the warm surface layer, drives a turbine and generates electricity. In this study, a model has been developed to compute the temperature difference between the deep (1000m) and surface (20m) seawater layers around Mauritius. An algorithm has been implemented to determine the net power generated from a proposed OTEC power plant, acquired through the processing of sea surface temperature satellite images, at a resolution of 1 km. The spatial and temporal variations of the net power generated has been observed by splitting the annual data into four monsoonal time frames. Results show that the south-western region of Mauritius possesses high OTEC resources, with annual mean daily net power generation capacity of about 95MW, representing about 20\% of the peak power demand of the island. Moreover, the bathymetry of the southern region is propitious due to deep cold water availability at a proximity of less than 5km from the coastline. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the OTEC system are found to be 1.9 and 22.8\%, respectively. A cost-benefit analysis indicates that profits of the order of 4.5 times the initial investment can be generated.

TI  - Watershed Prioritization Based On Morphometric Analysis Using Geospatial Technique In The Upper Kasai Sub-Watershed Of Purulia District, West Bengal (India)
JO  - Fluvial Systems in the Anthropocene: Process, Response and Modelling
PY  - 2022
AB  - The current study intended to assess the watershed prioritization of upper Kasai sub-watershed of Purulia District of West Bengal, India, using geospatial tech-nology. The study district is a drought prone and facing the problems of water scarcity and soil erosion, to prevent the degradation of these natural resources, watershed prioritization can significantly used. Thus, to delineate micro-watersheds of Kasai river basin area, watershed prioritization through morphometric technique has been attempted through the integration of RS and GIS. The study deals with the quantita-tive investigation of the various morphometry taking SRTM DEM, IRS P6, LISS-III and LISS-IV remotely sensed data. The application of the geospatial method was carried out for such geospatial and morphometric analysis in the Kasai sub-watershed to portray various physical setting and scientific information, like geology, geomor-phology, slope, lineament, drainage, soil, land use land cover, etc. Moreover, the present estimation includes rectification of DEM, extraction of various derived layers, like slope, flow direction, drainage network, drainage density, soil erosion etc. The morphometric attributes covering linear, areal aspects and assorted parameters, like stream length, stream frequency, drainage density, drainage texture etc. was also carried out for the delineation of mini watershed area and thus, it is divided into 12 sub-watersheds. According to RUSLE model the area is characterized by potential average annual soil loss, which is especially high and severe (>1 to 15 t ha−1 year−1)in the north-eastern and south-eastern parts of the watershed. Furthermore, the problem of water scarcity enduring in this area can be minimized through its prioritization and accordingly watershed management has been suggested. The outcomes facilitate the planner to formulate location specific plans and implement these effectively and therefore, it is useful for social benefits of the stakeholders at different levels for resilient management. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Critical Infrastructures or Critical Entities that belong to these sectors are exposed to a wide range of natural and man-made threats, including natural hazards, terrorist attacks, insider threats, or sabotage, but also to cyber-attacks, which are emerging especially with the use of information related systems, as in the space domain. More specifically, a physical attack on a space ground segment could make the distribution of satellite data problematic, while a cyber-attack attack on its data storage, access and exchange could affect not only the reliability of space data, but also their FAIR standards. The present work will focus on the enhancement of the preparedness and response phases of crisis management, through the use of technological and operational solutions. Thus, three tools namely CIRP-RAT, ENGAGE CSIM and ERPs are presented, including their functionalities and benefits offered to the end-users. The findings and developments presented, are linked with the EU funded project 7SHIELD, which aims to provide the European Ground Segment of Space Systems, with a holistic framework for their cyber–physical protection, enabling them to confront complex cyber and physical threats, by covering all the stages of crisis management, namely pre-crisis, crisis and post-crises. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Identifying Critical Migratory Bottlenecks And High-Use Areas For An Endangered Migratory Soaring Bird Across Three Continents
JO  - JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
PY  - 2018
AB  - Migrant birds face a number of threats throughout their annual cycle, including persecution, collision with energy infrastructure, and habitat and climate change. A key challenge for the conservation of migrants is the identification of important habitat, including migratory concentration areas, because species survival rates may be determined by events in geographically very limited areas. Remote-tracking technology is facilitating the identification of such critical habitat, although the strategic identification of important sites and incorporation of such knowledge in conservation planning remains limited. We tracked 45 individuals of an endangered, soaring migrant (Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus), over 75 complete migrations that traversed three continents along the Red Sea Flyway. We summarize and contextualize migration statistics by season and age class, including migration start, midpoint, and end dates, as well as linear and cumulative migration distance, migration duration and speed, and route straightness. Then, using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, we quantified space use to identify the most important migratory bottlenecks and high-use areas on the flyway. These areas each accounted for < 5\% of the overall movement range of the tracked birds, yet > 20\% of all tracks passed through bottlenecks, and > 50\% of the overall vulture time spent on migration fell within high-use areas. The most important sites were located at the southeastern Red Sea coast and Bab-el-Mandeb Strait (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Djibouti), the Suez Canal zone (Egypt), and the Gulf of Iskenderun (Turkey). Discouragingly however, none of the area within the major migratory bottlenecks was protected and < 13\% of the high-use areas were protected. This demonstrates a very concerning gap in the protected area network for migratory soaring birds along the Red Sea Flyway. Because reducing threats at migratory concentrations can be a very efficient approach to protect populations, our work provides clear guidelines where conservation investment is urgently needed to benefit as many as 35 migratory soaring-bird species that regularly use the Red Sea Flyway.

TI  - Predicting The Geographical Distribution Of Acropora Muricata In Two Lesser-Known Reef Systems Of The Andaman Sea
JO  - Journal of Coastal Conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Coral reefs are undergoing deterioration worldwide due to climate and anthropogenic stressors, notwithstanding the enormous support they provide to marine biodiversity and the essential services to humans. Knowledge about the extent of hard coral distribution is a key requirement for designing conservation strategies such as Marine Protected Areas(MPA). The transboundary island groups of the Andaman Sea—Andaman, Nicobar and Mergui Archipelagos—are largely underexplored and less managed due to their remoteness and various political constraints. In the present study, we developed a maximum entropy (Maxent) based distribution model for the stony coral Acropora muricata by using records of its occurrence and 14 remotely sensed environmental variables along with bathymetry and distance from the shore as predictors. Our model predicted this species’ current distribution, with the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.908. The important predictor variables determining the distribution were bathymetry, distance from the shore, calcite, PAR, and ocean current. Many of the unexplored islands, seamounts and shallow patches of the Andaman Sea such as Cinque Island, Invisible Bank, Batti Malv Island, Tillanchong island, Narcondam, Barren island, Than, Dunkin, Cash Island, the southern tip of Zadetkyi, Bruer, Graham, Clara Island, Buda, Lord Loughborough Island, Quoin Island, Tachai, Koh Bon, Ko Payang and several other unnamed sites were predicted as potential areas of occurrence of A. muricata as per this study. The presence of this species, which is the most common hard coral in the Indo-Pacific, indicates the existence of coral reef ecosystems in these areas. Such habitats and the region’s proximity towards the coral triangle imply better chances of connectivity and resilience. This study will contribute toward designing a transboundary conservation network and developing management plans to maintain sustainable fisheries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Projecting The Impact Of Air Pollution On Child Stunting In India—Synergies And Trade-Offs Between Climate Change Mitigation, Ambient Air Quality Control, And Clean Cooking Access
JO  - Environmental Research Letters
PY  - 2022
AB  - Many children in India face the double burden of high exposure to ambient (AAP) and household air pollution, both of which can affect their linear growth. Although climate change mitigation is expected to decrease AAP, climate policies could increase the cost of clean cooking fuels. Here, we develop a static microsimulation model to project the air pollution-related burden of child stunting in India up to 2050 under four scenarios combining climate change mitigation (2 °C target) with national policies for AAP control and subsidised access to clean cooking. We link data from a nationally representative household survey, satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a multi-dimensional demographic projection and PM2.5 and clean cooking access projections from an integrated assessment model. We find that the positive effects on child linear growth from reductions in AAP under the 2 °C Paris Agreement target could be fully offset by the negative effects of climate change mitigation through reduced clean cooking access. Targeted AAP control or subsidised access to clean cooking could shift this trade-off to result in net benefits of 2.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.4, 4.2) or 6.5 (UI: 6.3, 6.9) million cumulative prevented cases of child stunting between 2020-50 compared to business-as-usual. Implementation of integrated climate, air quality, and energy access interventions has a synergistic impact, reducing cumulative number of stunted children by 12.1 (UI: 10.7, 13.7) million compared to business-as-usual, with the largest health benefits experienced by the most disadvantaged children and geographic regions. Findings underscore the importance of complementing climate change mitigation efforts with targeted air quality and energy access policies to concurrently deliver on carbon mitigation, health and air pollution and energy poverty reduction goals in India. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Uav For Remote Sensing Applications: An Analytical Review
JO  - Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering
PY  - 2024
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have occupied a pertinent space in the field of remote sensing in recent years. UAVs are powered aircraft with pre-programmed flight planning. They are operated remotely. UAVs also known as drones can propose a practical and sustainable alternative to traditional platforms when it comes to procuring cost-effective high-resolution remote sensing data, greater versatility and operational flexibility. The practical use of UAV remote sensing in various fields like environmental studies, disaster management, flood monitoring system, archaeology, land-use dynamic monitoring, meteorological disaster monitoring, fighting COVID-19 pandemic, etc., is considered to have enhanced the application domains. Moreover, the effective use of UAVs for acquiring digital elevation model (DEM) data renders analytical advantages in a wide range of remote sensing applications. The need of the hour is to examine and religiously work on the diverse research aspects and trends of UAV remote sensing to augment its regular use. This paper reviews and examines the innumerable benefits and significance of the use of UAV platform for remote sensing applications in various fields. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.

TI  - Performance Of Optimised Scr Retrofit Buses Under Urban Driving And Controlled Conditions
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2015
AB  - This work presents the first comprehensive real-world emissions results from urban buses retrofitted with an optimised low-NO2 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. The SCRT system combines a CRT (Continuously Regenerating Trap) to reduce particle emissions and SCR to reduce NOx emissions. The optimised low-NO2 SCRT was designed to work under urban conditions where the vehicle exhaust gas temperature is often too low for many SCR systems to work efficiently. The system was extensively tested through on-road and test track measurements using a vehicle emission remote sensing instrument capable of measuring both nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Over 700 on-road measurements of the SCRT system were made in London. Compared with identical buses operating under the same conditions fitted with a CRT, NO2 emissions were reduced by 61% and total NOx by 45%. Under test track conditions reductions in NOx of 77% were observed. The test track results do reveal however that compared with an original Euro III bus without a CRT, the SCRT retrofit bus emissions of NO2 are 50% higher. Engine-out and tailpipe measurements of several important engine parameters under test track conditions showed the important effect of SCR inlet temperature on NOx conversion efficiency. Overall, we conclude that retrofitting urban buses to use low-NO2 SCRT systems is an effective method for delivering NOx and NO2 emissions reduction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Preliminary Regional Flood Damage Investigation
JO  - Advanced Science Letters
PY  - 2012
AB  - It is fully realized that absolute immunity from flood damage is not physically possible even in the distant future because of unpredictability of several natural forces which might cause unprecedented situation. Even so, with proper planning and continuous effort we can certainly look forward to an appreciable diminution of distress with an accelerated implementation of flood management measures. It i s commonly accepted that the measures to mitigate flood losses need to be given the most efforts wherein flood damage estimation is the primary measure of mitigation. This has been viewed mainly as a physical method of protection from floods. As a first step, a floodplain of SinNan area is undertaken as the study area that would naturally be affected by flooding in such a way that a river rises above its banks, or high tides and stormy seas cause flooding in coastal areas. Generally the satellite photograph is about 20 × 20 meters and may not yield very precise idea of the measurement. In order to increase the accuracy of measurement, 1/1000 aerial photographs for the study area are made as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with 50 × 50 cms resolution was produced all thru Light Detection And Ranging¡ALiDAR. This DTM is used with a hydraulic model for simulation of flooding extent and depths while a net-work of observation stations where gauges have been installed in order to record river flow, flood depth etc. and then assess its effectiveness. And other available topographic maps have been utilized as well to study direct economic damages. The present position regarding maintenance of rain gauges, recording of rainfall, transmission of data, post-disaster data collection etc., need to be streamlined as use for the regional flood damage assessment of the economic losses such as crops, houses, property, public utilities etc. There is a lot of spatial distributed information involved in and GIS was used in this study to build up geo-database and to do spatial analysis for a more rational algorithm for flood damage assessments. Flood data are crucial for the net-work of this project while typhoon-induced flood events during the summer seasons may be the major contribution. The net-work should come into operation within 9 months in this year and it expects to result in the regional flood damage investigation in SinNan area. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

TI  - Vegetation And Prescribed Fire: Implications For Stone's Sheep And Elk
JO  - Journal of Wildlife Management
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fire is the dominant single natural disturbance influencing northern mountain and boreal landscapes. We evaluated fire-induced changes in forage resources for 2 focal ungulates, Stone's sheep (Ovis dalli stonei) and elk (Cervus canadensis), in northern British Columbia, Canada. We implemented 4 prescribed fires and monitored short-term vegetation (quantity and quality) and ungulate (Stone's sheep and elk) responses. We took measurements prior to burning, the year of burning, and 1 year after burning in treatment areas and adjacent unburned control areas in winter and summer at 2 scales. At a fine scale, we used vegetation transects and pellet counts; at the landscape scale, we used Landsat imagery for vegetation and aerial survey flights for animals. Following prescribed fire, shrub cover declined and burned communities increased in herbaceous cover. Plant species diversity also declined but increased to almost that of unburned areas by 1 year after burning. Burning increased quality of forage most (2–7 percentage points more digestibility and 0.3–6.3 percentage points more crude protein than unburned areas) in the summer of the burn. In winter, forage biomass and available digestible dry matter increased to pre-burn levels by 1 year after burning. Stone's sheep and elk always used burned areas more than unburned control areas in winter at both scales. Whereas elk used sites with higher forage quantity, Stone's sheep appeared to respond to forage quality at the fine scale. Ungulate grazing during the 2 years of this study did not alter forage quantity on burned or unburned sites, as determined from range exclosures. Based on our findings in this area, maximum benefits to elk would be achieved from large prescribed fires on south-aspect slopes that result in the greatest amounts of forage biomass. Smaller prescribed fires at high burn intensities on west-aspect slopes intermixed with rocky outcrops and talus scree (less frequented by elk) would most benefit Stone's sheep requirements for high-quality forage and escape terrain. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018

TI  - Overcoming The Impact Of The Covid-19 Pandemic On Oncology Early Phase Trials And Drug Development In Asia—Experiences And Perspectives Of The Asian Oncology Early Phase 1 Consortium
JO  - Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim: The significance and prioritization of early phase oncology trial continuation during a global pandemic is unknown. This study reported the outcomes, multiple challenges, and broad recommendations associated with the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on oncology early phase 1 trials—and on drug development in Asia—based on the experiences and perspectives of Asian oncology phase 1 centers. Methods: Between March and April 2020 during the initial period of outbreak, the impact of COVID-19 across oncology phase 1 sites in five Asian countries—China (Hong Kong), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore—was retrospectively analyzed. Results: There was no trial termination or treatment discontinuation in all five countries. Although the most common impact was new patient enrollment being placed on hold, which was based on pharmaceutical sponsors’ decision-making, the situation varied per site. Most sites had no restrictions in place that would limit their ability to fully comply with the requirements of conducting the early phase studies. The number of protocol deviations during the pandemic was largely dependent on domestic transportation status during the outbreak rather than the ability of the clinical trial centers. Conclusion: Determining the risk to benefits ratio of patients with cancer who are enrolled in early phase 1 clinical trials under the unusual circumstances of a global pandemic is important. Specific guidance or guidelines on the conduct of early phase 1 clinical trials during public health emergencies that are based on the recent lessons learned is urgently required. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Prediction Of Land Use Change And Ecosystem Services Value: A Case Study In Nanping, China
JO  - Applied Ecology and Environmental Research
PY  - 2018
AB  - Changes in land use affect the structure, processes, and functions of ecosystems, and thus influence the ability of ecosystems to serve human beings. The prediction of land use and ecosystem services value can provide reference for the rational planning of land resources and relevant policy-making. Based on the CA-Markov model and the service value per unit area of terrestrial ecosystems in China, the area of land use types and ecosystem services value were predicted for 2030 and the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions were put forward. The study found that from 2015-2030, the area of forest land had the largest increase, while the area of land for construction had the largest decrease. The spatial distribution of land use in 2030 was predicted to be almost the same as that in 2015. The slight increase in the value of ecosystem services in 2030 was mainly due to improvement in the service capacity of waste treatment and gas regulation. The contribution rate of the service value of forest land to the total ecosystem services value was predicted to gradually decrease from 2015-2030. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Technology certainly plays a significant part in the precision agriculture scheme, but understanding the appropriateness of the different forms of technology in response to a management problem is an essential element for successful precision agriculture implementation. Many of the enabling technologies discussed are at varying stages of development with many having restricted application and usefulness when applied at the within-paddock level. However, these technologies can still contribute to larger-scale forms of precision agriculture at the region, mill, farm or paddock level. If the sugar industry decides that using global positioning system and geographic information system to chase the benefits of selective harvesting is potentially worthwhile, sorting out the spatial and temporal interactions between yield and CCS will be a critical research issue. Thus the adoption of theses technologies in a precision conservation philosophy could assist in managing the interactions between cane farming and environmental protection in the sensitive coastal floodplain ecosystems.

TI  - Hosted Secondary Payloads On Commercial Communications Satellites: Looking At The Whole Problem
JO  - 26th AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference, ICSSC
PY  - 2008
AB  - There is nothing novel in the idea of hosting secondary payloads on communications satellites. Using the unused spacecraft resources typically held as margin for a secondary payload has potentially great benefits for all parties involved. Unfortunately the idea of hosted payloads has been poorly executed. The number of communications satellites that have secondary payloads compared to the number that could have had secondary payloads is miniscule. Part of the problem is the very narrow focus on the technical challenges of secondary payload hosting, with no view to the economic and organizational challenges. One great challenge of successful secondary payload hosting is to bridge the organizational differences between the host spacecraft providers-almost always privately held commercial entities-and the payload providers-typically defense or science related offices of the government. The organizational differences appear in all program phases, from hardware procurement to development to execution. Between these organizations there exists a major difference in the goals and views of the space assets entirely. Revenue generation is the ultimate reason for bringing a commercial payload to space while the unique vantage point for observation is the reason that draws science and military interests. Free market economics with the aim of maximizing profit margins, and minimizing non recurring costs has enabled commercial space to routinely execute commercial missions from start of contract to launch in two years or less at prices a fraction of those of government run missions. Indeed, when government sponsored missions operate to similar time lines it is usually a cause for celebrations and press releases. Unfortunately the government entities interested in having their secondary payloads hosted often find alien and challenging the very streamlined approach and efficiencies which make commercial space so attractive. A further complexity of the issue is that different entities within the government sponsored science and defense agencies have their own nuanced views as well as payloads that are intended to fulfill different functions such as operations, basic science, defense, or technology demonstration. Science and defense organizations do not operate the same way. Integrating payloads from such different backgrounds within a single mission will inevitably lead to both procedural and technical implications for the interfaces. This paper identifies the difficulties arising from such differences and discusses the efforts to develop a standardized technical interface and integration process to bring together a combined mission consisting of a privately owned and operated spacecraft containing the primary communications and secondary hosted payloads. Understanding and flexibility both are needed to achieve a symbiotic relationship that allows for cost saving of all parties while not slowing down the pace or making inefficient the commercial aspect of the mission while still accommodating the different mission requirements and procedural differences of the host payload provider.

AB  - The Office of Naval Research, the Naval Research Laboratory, and commercial partner Space Technology Development Corporation are currently in the critical design phase of the Naval EarthMap Observer (NEMO) spacecraft program. NEMO will demonstrate the utility of a hyperspectral earth-imaging system to support Naval needs for characterization of the littoral (coastal ocean) regions of the world and commercial needs for land use management, agriculture, environmental studies, and mineral exploration. Data handling from user request to data delivery is one of the many challenges posed by NEMO. The NEMO program must be able to accept data requests from users, create spacecraft tasking, collect data from the spacecraft, process and archive the data, provide access for users to browse collected imagery, and deliver processed data products to these users. Some of these steps will employ unique approaches due to the nature of hyperspectral imagery data.

TI  - Evaluation Of Habitat Provision On The Basis Of Carabidae Diversity In Slovak Permanent Grasslands
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2016
AB  - Biodiversity has an important role in creating and regulating ecosystem processes, functions, and services. Carabidae are considered to be suitable bio-indicators of environment. The aim of the study is to analyse the relationships between Carabidae and the ability of study sites to fulfil habitat provision. The research was conducted on permanent grasslands (PG) with different management at 2 study sites (Tajov-TA, Liptovska Teplicka-LT) located in different climatic and natural conditions of Slovakia. At each study site, seven plastic traps were placed in spring 2015 for one month in line with 3 m distance. The habitat provision was identified by Biotope Valuation Method (BVM). The calculated values of both study sites were same (BVM = 41.67). One of the reasons can be the same type of habitat. According to the Catalogue of habitats in Slovakia, both study sites belong to mesophilic pastures and grazed grassland. Biodiversity was evaluated by Shannon-Weaver index. The calculated values were similar (H'= 1.42 in TA, H'= 1.25 in LT). In Tajov, a total of 220 individuals of soil arthropods were captured and 169 in Liptovska Teplicka. In Tajov, three eurytopic species of Carabidae and one adaptable species (Abax Parallelepipedus) were captured. One order belongs to eudominant species: Poecilus cupreus (50%). In Liptovska Teplicka, four eurytopic species of Carabidae and two adaptable species (Carabus cancellatus, Carabus violaceus) were captured. Two species belong to eudominat species: Carabus cancellatus (40.54%) and Carabus vialaceus (13.51%). The relationship between Carabidae diversity and the ability of study site to fulfil habitat provision was not confirmed. Carabidae are not closely linked to structure of the vegetation cover, but their occurrence is influenced by habitat microclimate conditions.

TI  - Evaluating The Effect Of Plain Afforestation Project And Future Spatial Suitability In Beijing
JO  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Taking the "One Million-Mu (666 km(2))" Plain Afforestation (Phase I) Project (Phase I afforestation) in Beijing city as an example, we monitored the growth status of planted forest using long-term remote sensing images, and evaluated the impacts of afforestation on land use change and vegetation growth. We found there is a large space for improvement regarding the ecological benefits of the project. Moreover, we found forest patches with decreasing greenness after the afforestation were mainly converted from farmland with high greenness and low heterogeneity in terms of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This implies that those farmland patches are inappropriate for afforestation. According to the results from Phase I afforestation and the impact of urbanization on green space, we constructed a series of spatial variables and generated a suitability map for the next "New Round of One Million-Mu (666 km(2)) Afforestation project" (Phase II afforestation). We then modeled the spatial distribution of Phase II afforestation based on the derived suitability map. This study is crucial for the scientific evaluation of afforestation projects for space planning (e.g., urban green space planning). The evaluation and modeling framework built in this study can be used to support the decision making and policy implementation of afforestation projects in China.

TI  - Gap‐Filling Eddy Covariance Latent Heat Flux: Inter‐Comparison Of Four Machine Learning Model Predictions And Uncertainties In Forest Ecosystem
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Environmental monitoring using satellite remote sensing is challenging because of data gaps in eddy‐covariance (EC)‐based in situ flux tower observations. In this study, we obtain the latent heat flux (LE) from an EC station and perform gap filling using two deep learning methods (two‐dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short‐term memory (LSTM) neural networks) and two machine learning (ML) models (support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)), and we investigate their accuracies and uncertainties. The average model performance based on ~25 input and hysteresis combinations show that the mean absolute error is in an acceptable range (34.9 to 38.5 Wm−2), which indicates a marginal difference among the performances of the four models. In fact, the model performance is ranked in the following order: SVM > CNN > RF > LSTM. We conduct a robust analysis of variance and post‐hoc tests, which yielded statistically insignificant results (p‐value ranging from 0.28 to 0.76). This indicates that the distribution of means is equal within groups and among pairs, thereby implying similar performances among the four models. The time‐series analysis and Taylor diagram indicate that the improved two‐dimensional CNN captures the temporal trend of LE the best, i.e., with a Pearson’s correlation of > 0.87 and a normalized standard deviation of ~0.86, which are similar to those of in situ datasets, thereby demonstrating its superiority over other models. The factor elimination analysis reveals that the CNN performs better when specific meteorological factors are removed from the training stage. Additionally, a strong coupling between the hysteresis time factor and the accuracy of the ML models is observed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Assessing The Changes In Land Use And Ecosystem Services In Changzhou Municipality, Peoples' Republic Of China, 1991-2006
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2014
AB  - Much of the world is experiencing fast urbanization. Many peri-urban open spaces, such as parks, forest, farmland, and wetlands, have been built over, which has resulted in a steep decline of ecosystem services at the municipal and regional levels. Using remote sensing, geography information system (GIS) technology and economic evaluation method for ecosystem services, the evolution of landscape spatial structure in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 of Changzhou City, People's Republic of China, was obtained and the change of ecosystem services resulted from land use change was evaluated. Study results show a continuing expansion of urbanized areas and reduction in ecosystem services. Before 2001, farmland was the main type of land use, accounting for more than 53.3% of the total area within the broadly-drawn municipal boundaries. In 2006, farmland and built-up areas were the main land-use types. The built-up area increased by 122% from 1991 to 2006. From 1991 to 2001, the proportion of ecological land (farmland, forests, grasslands, and water-covered areas) within Changzhou's municipal boundaries decreased 24.1%. Based on the observed changes, the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Changzhou's ecological land decreased by 19.3% from 1991 to 2006 and the annual decrease ratio was approximately 1.3%. Conversion of farmland to other uses was responsible for the largest reduction in the value of ecosystem services, equal to 239.8 million RMB (equivalent to USD 37.8 million). Our research results were already adopted locally by Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Urban Planning and applied for Changzhou Mater Urban Planning. The current study can contribute not only to improvements in the Changzhou environment, but to the study of and improvements to other rapidly-urbanizing cities, as the rapid growth of urban areas is one of the most pronounced environmental trends of recent times. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Observability Of Ionospheric Space-Time Structure With Isr: A Simulation Study
JO  - Radio Science
PY  - 2017
AB  - The sources of error from electronically steerable array (ESA) incoherent scatter radar (ISR) systems are investigated both theoretically and with use of an open-source ISR simulator, developed by the authors, called Simulator for ISR (SimISR). The main sources of error incorporated in the simulator include statistical uncertainty, which arises due to nature of the measurement mechanism and the inherent space-time ambiguity from the sensor. SimISR can take a field of plasma parameters, parameterized by time and space, and create simulated ISR data at the scattered electric field (i.e., complex receiver voltage) level, subsequently processing these data to show possible reconstructions of the original parameter field. To demonstrate general utility, we show a number of simulation examples, with two cases using data from a self-consistent multifluid transport model. Results highlight the significant influence of the forward model of the ISR process and the resulting statistical uncertainty on plasma parameter measurements and the core experiment design trade-offs that must be made when planning observations. These conclusions further underscore the utility of this class of measurement simulator as a design tool for more optimal experiment design efforts using flexible ESA class ISR systems. ©2017.

TI  - Digital Earth Australia - From Satellite Data To Better Decisions
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Australian Government spends well over half a billion dollars every year in programs designed to protect, enhance or measure the environment. This diverse range of programs covers a breadth of activities such as driving changes in land management practices to protect the Great Barrier Reef, undertaking surveys of agricultural productivity, and the management of millions of dollars of environmental water that is used to protect and improve critical wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin. Earth observation (EO) data has a vital role to play in optimizing this investment and demonstrating value-for-money to taxpayers. Ubiquitous spatial coverage, decades of regular observations and paddock-scale resolution mean that EO data has a unique ability to provide insights into the effectiveness of land and water programmes and ensure that Australia is getting the maximum value from its investments. Through the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Program, Australia has pioneered the use of 'big space data' techniques to enable satellite data to be effectively and easily exploited to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Australian Government. DEA is based on the Australian Geoscience Data Cube which was developed by Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and Australia's National Computational Infrastructure. The Australian Geoscience Data Cube has now been released as the Open Data Cube.

TI  - Utilizing Remote Sensing And Gis To Detect Prairie Dog Colonies
JO  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2007
AB  - The locations of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus {[}Ord]) colonies on a 550-km(2) study site in northeastern Wyoming, United States, were estimated using 3 remote sensing methods: raw satellite imagery (Landsat 7 ETM+), enhanced satellite imagery (integration of imagery with thematic layers via a Geographic Information System), and aerial reconnaissance (observations taken from a small plane). A supervised classification of the raw satellite imagery yielded an overall accuracy of 64.4\%, relative to ground-truthed locations of prairie dog colonies. The enhanced satellite imagery, resulting from a filtering of the data based on an index derived from the sum of weighted ecological factors associated with prairie dog colonies (slopes, land cover, soil, and "greenness" via the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) yielded ail overall accuracy of 69.2\%. The aerial reconnaissance method provided 65.1\% accuracy. The highest rate of false positives resulted from the aerial reconnaissance method (39.9\%). The highest rate of false negatives resulted from the raw satellite imagery (60.0\%), a value that was markedly reduced via the enhancement with ecological data from thematic layers (45.8\%). Given the accuracy, interpretability of results, repeatability, objectivity, cost, and safety, the enhanced satellite imagery method is the recommended approach to large-scale detection of black-tailed prairie dog colonies. If a greater accuracy is required, this method can be employed as a coarse filter to narrow the scale and scope of a more costly and laborious fine-scale analysis effectively.

TI  - Developing A Spatially Explicit Flood Susceptibility Index For Critical Infrastructure In Us Cities
JO  - World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2022: Adaptive Planning and Design in an Age of Risk and Uncertainty - Selected Papers from the World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - Despite growing science and policy attention on "resilient cities," spatially explicit estimates pinpointing the flood susceptibility of critical infrastructure (CI) are yet to be developed for US cities. CI including road network, water and energy distribution hubs, hospitals, fire and police stations can be highly vulnerable to flood inundation. Yet, the existing susceptibility estimates in US are confined to 100-year floodplains, which naturally overlook CI outside the pre-determined flood zones and largely underestimate the total magnitude of their susceptibility. This research aims to develop a new index capable of estimating and ranking flood susceptibility of CIs in any US city irrespective of the CI locations within or outside 100-year flood zones. Based completely on open-source geospatial data, the proposed approach first identifies potential flood inundation areas independently from historical inundation occurrences, and geomorphic landscape features including the height above nearest drainage, distance from stream, and curve number at 10-m spatial resolution. Next, a multi-criteria optimization process produces corresponding weighting factors to integrate these variables into a quantifiable index. The value of this index ranges between 0 and 1, measuring the relative magnitude of flood susceptibility across all CI (1 denoting the most susceptible CI) within the geographical extent of analyses. Initial validations with respect to remotely sensed inundation extents show good accuracy of the new flood susceptibility index. The results from a preliminary study on Houston, Texas, suggest that (1) more than 50% of highly flood-susceptible CI (index value greater than 0.5) are outside the known 100-year flood zone, and (2) flood susceptibility of a CI is not necessarily correlated with its proximity to a river. The approach and results presented here will pave a new way for fast, accurate, and economic policy decisions to effectively materialize the perception of resilient cities across the nation. © ASCE.

TI  - Fire Incidence On Vegetation In Cundinamarca And Bogota D.c. (Colombia) During The 2001-2010 Period
JO  - Acta Biologica Colombiana
PY  - 2012
AB  - This work aims to use remote sensing as a method for determining fire dynamics in the department of Cundinamarca and the city of Bogotá D.C. in Colombia, by analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of fires and the different types of vegetation affected in the 2011-2010 period. Based on MODIS fire hotspots, we found that the pattern fires in the study area are within the national standard, which includes increased number of events during the dry seasons (January-March and July- September). The fire incidence is caused by low rainfall that complements the root causes of ignition, which are mainly started by human intervention. The most affected populations are Caparrapí with 159 fires; Bogotá with 152 fires and Guaduas with 101 fires. Bogotá recorded most of their fires within protected areas in the south, in the area of Sumapaz. Sumapaz National Park (84), followed by the District Integrated Management Cuchilla de San Antonio (21) and Protective Forest Reserve Páramo Grande (9). Among the vegetation affected we can find grasses, shrubs, bushes and mosaics, emphasizing high values of impact on vegetation of páramo and subpáramo. The central and northwestern parts, south and southeast parts of the department, are those with more outbreaks, and most of them are between 0 to 1,000 masl and 3,000 to 4,000 masl. Finally active fires in the study area follow a pattern associated to the climate and in particular to the dry season but also show an altitudinal pattern. National and regional protected areas are effective against fires.

TI  - Identifying And Monitoring Gardens In Urban Areas Using Aerial And Satellite Imagery
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - In dry regions, gardens and trees within the urban space are of considerable significance. These gardens are facing harsh weather conditions and environmental stresses; on the other hand, due to the high value of land in urban areas, they are constantly subject to destruction and land use change. Therefore, the identification and monitoring of gardens in urban areas in dry regions and their impact on the ecosystem are the aims of this study. The data utilized are aerial and Sentinel-2 images (2018-2022) for Yazd Township in Iran. Several satellite and aerial image fusion methods were employed and compared. The root mean square error (RMSE) of horizontal shortcut connections (HSC) and color normalization (CN) were the highest compared to other methods with values of 18.37 and 17.5, respectively, while the Ehlers method showed the highest accuracy with a RMSE value of 12.3. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was then calculated using the images with 15 cm spatial resolution retrieved from the fusion. Aerial images were classified by NDVI and digital surface model (DSM) using object-oriented methods. Different object-oriented classification methods were investigated, including support vector machine (SVM), Bayes, random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). SVM showed the greatest accuracy with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa of 86.2 and 0.89, respectively, followed by RF with OA and kappa of 83.1 and 0.87, respectively. Separating the gardens using NDVI, DSM, and aerial images from 2018, the images were fused in 2022, and the current status of the gardens and associated changes were classified into completely dried, drying, acceptable, and desirable conditions. It was found that gardens with a small area were more prone to destruction, and 120 buildings were built in the existing gardens in the region during 2018-2022. Moreover, the monitoring of land surface temperature (LST) showed an increase of 14 C-? in the areas that were changed from gardens to buildings.

TI  - Hyperspectral-Multispectral Image Fusion Using Nearest-Neighbor Diffusion-Based Sharpening Algorithm
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2022
AB  - The nearest-neighbor diffusion-based algorithm (NNDiffuse) has seen great success in multispectral pansharpening. Here, we extend the capabilities of NNDiffuse to perform image fusion of high-res multispectral and low-res hyperspectral images (HRMSI+LRHSI fusion). Unlike learning-based frameworks which are computationally expensive and require extensive optimization and/or training time, NNDiffuse is fast, radiometrically accurate (introduces less spectral distortions compared to other state-of-the-art methods), and requires no training data. We introduce the utility of NNDiffuse in hyperspectral-panchromatic and hyperspectral-multispectral sharpening and look at workflows dealing with low-res HSI bands that fall outside the HRMSI spectral response functions. Sharpened image quality is assessed using image-wide metrics. Sharpening performance is also measured on the fused images in terms of their utility in pixel classification and ACE target-background separability. NNDiffuse and DL- and non DL-based methods are presented using hyperspectral imagery from SHARE2012, AVIRIS-NextGen, Hyperspec-VNIR-C, and ROSIS sensors. © 2022 SPIE.

TI  - Remote Sensing And Evaluation Of The Wetland Ecological Degradation Process Of The Zoige Plateau Wetland In China
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Zoige Plateau Wetland is the largest high-altitude swamp wetland in China. It plays a key role in ecological balance and the global change. Climate change and improper utilization have consequently resulted in decreased wetland area, disrupted ecosystem structure, and wetland function degradation and function loss. The Zoige Plateau Wetland thus faces severe ecological degradation problems. In this study, selecting the Zoige Plateau Wetland as the study area, remote sensing was used to track the ecological degradation process during 2000–2015 from three aspects (area degradation, structure degradation and function degradation) and at three administrative levels (study area, county and key township). To assess the wetland degradation quantitatively, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to construct a composite wetland degradation index based on five indicators: wetland area change rate, landscape fractal dimension, landscape fragmentation, vegetation biomass and vegetation coverage. The results showed the following. (1) In terms of area change rate, the total wetland area had continuously decreased during 2000–2015 compared to that in the 1990s, and 2010 was the most significant. The frequency of negative change in the wetland area reached 87.5% in all four counties and across four time periods (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015), and 85% at the township level. At the spatial scale, Hongyuan County had the smallest wetland area change rate. (2) In terms of structure change, the variations in landscape fractal dimension and landscape fragmentation generally exhibited similar trends at different levels. Specifically, the ecosystem structure was seriously affected in 2000, then gradually recovered in 2005 and 2010, and was again under aggravated interference in 2015. (3) In terms of function change, the above-ground biomass yield in the northeastern region was higher than that in the southern region. A low value was detected in 2000, and then the value increased and remained essentially the same in 2005 and 2010. However, the value decreased in 2015, indicating deteriorated vegetation condition. The vegetation coverage in the study area remained steady, without deterioration in a particular year. (4) In terms of the whole study area, the wetland degradation grades in the four periods were mild (2000), moderate (2005), mild (2010) and mild (2015). In brief, the wetland degradation was the most severe in 2005. Over the 2000–2015 period, the spatial degradation pattern of the Zoige Plateau Wetland progressed from the northeast to the southwest. The model built in this study could be widely applicable. And this study has also some reference value for monitoring and management of wetland degradation by remote sensing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Dynamic Change In Normalised Vegetation Index (Ndvi) From 2015 To 2021 In Dhofar, Southern Oman In Response To The Climate Change
JO  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to vegetation and land cover worldwide. The loss of vegetation as a result of climate change can alter the functions and structure of the environment and its ecological systems. In the first part of this study, Sentinel-2 data, normalised different vegetation index (NDVI), and multiple regression methods were used to examine the impacts of the climatic factors of humidity, rainfall, and air temperature on vegetation dynamics from 2015 to 2021 in Dhofar, Southern Oman. In the second part of this study, random forest regression was employed to model the relationships between the NDVI and temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil map, geology map, topographic wetness index, curvature, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to buildings, and distance to roads. The multiple regression values revealed significant associations between the spatial distributions of the NDVI and the abovementioned climatic factors. The findings also indicated an increase of 1 degrees C in air temperature fluctuations between 2018 and 2021 over all five sites, with a strong tendency over Qairoon Hairiti Mountain. The rainfall records clearly indicated an increasing tendency from 2018 to 2020 due to the impact of frequent cyclones. Therefore, the results revealed a significant increase of 0.01 in the vegetation cover trend in 2018, 2019, and 2020 along the Sadah Mountain range and the eastern part of the Jabal Qara Mountains under the areas directly impacted by the cyclone, whereas there was a decrease along the western mountain range consisting of Jabal Qara and Jabal Qamar Mountains due to the impact of warm, dry air. The results revealed that NDVI values were sensitive to heavy rainfall over Jabal Samhan Mountain. The 12 variables that influenced NDVI levels had different levels of importance. Soil types, elevation, slope, rainfall, curvature, humidity, and temperature had the highest importance, while topographic wetness index, distance to urban area, aspect, distance to roads, and geology map had the lowest. The findings provide a significant foundation for Oman's planning and management of regional vegetation, water conservation, and animal husbandry.

TI  - Relative Importance Of The Land-Use Composition And Intensity For The Bird Community Composition In Anthropogenic Landscapes
JO  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2017
AB  - Humans are changing the biosphere by exerting pressure on land via different land uses with variable intensities. Quantifying the relative importance of the land-use composition and intensity for communities may provide valuable insights for understanding community dynamics in human-dominated landscapes. Here, we evaluate the relative importance of the land-use composition versus land-use intensity on the bird community structure in the highly human-dominated region surrounding Paris, France. The land-use composition was calculated from a land cover map, whereas the land-use intensity (reverse intensity) was represented by the primary productivity remaining after human appropriation (NPPremaining), which was estimated using remote sensing imagery. We used variance partitioning to evaluate the relative importance of the land-use composition versus intensity for explaining bird community species richness, total abundance, trophic levels, and habitat specialization in urban, farmland, and woodland habitats. The land-use composition and intensity affected specialization and richness more than trophic levels and abundance. The importance of the land-use intensity was slightly higher than that of the composition for richness, specialization, and trophic levels in farmland and urban areas, while the land-use composition was a stronger predictor of abundance. The intensity contributed more to the community indices in anthropogenic habitats (farmland and urban areas) than to those in woodlands. Richness, trophic levels, and specialization in woodlands tended to increase with the NPPremaining value. The heterogeneity of land uses and intensity levels in the landscape consistently promoted species richness but reduced habitat specialization and trophic levels. This study demonstrates the complementarity of NPPremaining to the land-use composition for understanding community structure in anthropogenic landscapes. Our results show, for the first time, that the productivity remaining after human appropriation is a determinant driver of animal community patterns, independent of the type of land use.

TI  - High-Resolution Emission Inventory Of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds For Rapidly Urbanizing Areas: A Case Of Shenzhen Megacity, China

PY  - 2024
AB  - The effects of volatile organic compounds on urban air quality and the ozone have been widely acknowledged, and the contributions of relevant biogenic sources are currently receiving rising attentions. However, inventories of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are in fact limited for the environmental management of megacities. In this study, we provided an estimation of BVOC emissions and their spatial characteristics in a typical urbanized area, Shenzhen megacity, China, based on an in-depth vegetation investigation and using remote sensing data. The total BVOC emission in Shenzhen in 2019 was estimated to be 3.84 x 109 g C, of which isoprene contributed to about 24.4\%, monoterpenes about 44.4\%, sesquiterpenes about 1.9\%, and other VOCs (OVOCs) about 29.3\%. Metropolitan BVOC emissions exhibited a seasonal pattern with a peak in July and a decline in January. They were mainly derived from the less built-up areas (88.9\% of BVOC emissions). Estimated BVOCs comprised around 5.2\% of the total municipal VOC emissions in 2019. This percentage may increase as more green spaces emerge and anthropogenic emissions decrease in built-up areas. Furthermore, synergistic effects existed between BVOC emissions and relevant vegetation-based ecosystem services (e.g., air purification, carbon fixation). Greening during urban sprawl should be based on a trade-off between BVOC emissions and ecosystem benefits of urban green spaces. The results suggested that urban greening in Shenzhen, and like other cities as well, need to account for BVOC contributions to ozone. Meanwhile, greening cites should adopt proactive environmental management by using plant species with low BVOC emissions to maintain urban ecosystem services while avoid further degradation to ozone pollution.

TI  - Automatic System For Crop Pest And Disease Dynamic Monitoring And Early Forecasting
JO  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Infected areas and damage levels due to crop pest and disease have been growing seriously according to the climate change. We aim to develop an automatic system to provide national pest and disease dynamic monitoring and early forecasting products, by integrating multisource information (Earth Observation, meteorological, ecological, entomological, and plant pathological, etc.) and cutting edge research on pest and disease modeling to support decision making in the sustainable management of pest and disease. First, we selected the sensitive indexes for pest and disease habitat monitoring and early forecasting, and then optimized the forecasting model's parameters to enhance its applicability in national level. Second, we developed an automatic system based on web GIS platform to efficiently realize the national pest and disease dynamic habitat monitoring and early forecasting. Finally, we released the pest and disease forecasting thematic maps. China's national disease wheat yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) and national pest oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria manilensis (Meyen)) are taking as the experimental objects. Based on the developed system, we forecasted the infected areas of rust and locust in China, in 2019, with these R-square values are higher than 0.87. This system would not only promote the efficacy of pest and disease management and prevention by improving accuracy of monitoring and forecasting, but also help to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides, which could thus guarantee food security and agriculture sustainable development in China.

TI  - Inertial Aided Cycle Slip Detection And Repair For Integrated Ground-Based High-Precision Local Positioning System /Ins System
PY  - 2018
AB  - Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System (GH-LPS) is a ground-based positioning system, it can provide high-precision, high reliability, and high environmental adaptability independently within a limited area. The location services to make up for space-based navigation systems on the ground are limited by many factors. It mainly uses the carrier phase measurement value for positioning. To ensure its stable performance, it is necessary to detect and repair the cycle slip caused by high dynamics, signal impairments, and loss of lock on the signal. Therefore, in this paper, we establish the integration positioning model of Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System /INS, we propose a method for using the inertial information to assist the Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System for cycle slip detection. We use the position information predicted by the INS to calculate the cycle slip detection decision, and use the hypothesis test to determine whether the cycle slip occurs and correctly identify the size and position of the occurrence of the cycle slip. The experimental analysis of the simulated and measured scenes validates the performance of the proposed algorithm for cycle slip detection, effectively detects the occurrence of small cycle slip. For the effect of different noise variance, the cycle slip detection method proposed in this paper can also keep the probability of accurate detection of cycle slips above 86\%. From the positioning result, detection and repair of cycle slip can improve positioning accuracy by 64\%.

TI  - The Liquid Droplet Radiator-European Perspective
JO  - SAE Technical Papers
PY  - 1994
AB  - The Liquid Droplet Radiator (LDR) has emerged as the most promising among a number of spacecraft radiator concepts, which seek to offer light-weight alternatives to conventional, primarily heat-pipe based, radiator technology. Relying solely on conventional radiator technology will in the future lead to an unacceptable mass penalty on the part of the radiator. In the LDR the solid surface of current radiator designs is replaced by a sheet-like spray of minute droplets, which radiate heat to space in between being ejected and collected external to the spacecraft. The droplet diameter is typically of the order of 100 μm. Early studies in the US indicated that by employing the LDR the radiator mass could be reduced five to ten times for high-power applications stretching from 100 kW and upwards. In view of the great potential benefits of the LDR, ESA decided in 1989 to study the LDR from a European perspective, which meant focussing on power levels well below what had been conceived previously. Following an initial literature survey, a contract was awarded to Bertin et Cie of France in 1991 for an in depth study of the LDR for heat rejection in the range 1 to 100 kW. It included a review of future growth of heat-rejection requirements for European space activities and a trade-off between design options and selection of one design for a detailed concept investigation. The related Liquid Sheet Radiator (LSR) concept was also part of the study. It appears that the most favourable design option for the reference mission, a 10 kW telecommunications satellite, as well as for the alternative, a 10 kW polar platform, would be a rectangular LDR with a mass considerably less than that of a comparable heat-pipe radiator. The design includes two droplet sheets (one out-going, one in-coming) and a structure, which consists of an unfurlable truss beam. Surrounding the droplet sheets, the truss beam is attached at one end to the exterior of the spacecraft via a yoke and a rotating drive to maintain grazing sun-incidence. The droplet generator is modular, with a shear valve for turning it on and off and operates based on the cavity-disturbance mode. The droplet collector is of the linear type with an auxiliary film. A review of the technology status in Europe shows that all necessary competence for development of the LDR is available. Furthermore, critical technologies have been identified in order to help orienting a future development programme. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.

TI  - Safety And Efficacy Of Glibenclamide Combined With Rtpa In Acute Cerebral Ischemia With Occlusion/Stenosis Of Anterior Circulation (Se-Grace): Study Protocol For A Randomized Controlled Trial
JO  - BMC NEUROLOGY
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) improves outcome for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), but many of them still have substantial disability. Glibenclamide (US adopted name, glyburide), a long-acting sulfonylurea, shows promising result in treating AIS from both preclinical and clinical studies. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of glibenclamide combined with rtPA in treating AIS patients. Methods This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with an estimated sample size of 306 cases, starting in January 2018. Patients aged 18 to 74 years, presented with a symptomatic anterior circulation occlusion with a deficit on the NIHSS of 4 to 25 points and treated with intravenous rtPA within the first 4.5 h of their clinical onsets, are eligible for participation in this study. The target time from the onset of symptoms to receive the study drug is of 10 h. Subjects are randomized 1: 1 to receive glibenclamide or placebo with a loading dose of 1.25 mg, followed by 0.625 mg every 8 h for total 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint is 90-day good outcome, measured as modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2. Safety outcomes are all-cause 30-day mortality and early neurological deterioration, with a focus on cardiac- and glucose-related serious adverse events. Discussion This study will provide valuable information about the safety and efficacy of oral glibenclamide for AIS patients treated with rtPA. This would bring benefits to a large number of patients if the agent is proved to be effective.

TI  - Updated Information On Soil Salinity In A Typical Oasis Agroecosystem And Desert-Oasis Ecotone: Case Study Conducted Along The Tarim River, China
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - Precise and spatially explicit regional estimates of soil salinity are necessary to efficiently management and utilise limited land and water resources. Despite advances achieved in remote sensing over the past century, knowledge about the distribution and severity of soil salinization in economically important areas, such as oasis agroecosystems and desert-oasis ecotones (OADoE), is currently limited. An example of an area is southern Xinjiang, where the OADoE has a high anthropogenic influence. This study was conducted with the aim of mapping soil salinity in typical OADoE using remote sensing and machine learning techniques (Cubist and Random Forest, RF). A range of covariates was obtained from the multi-temporal Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) satellite for the period from 2013 to 2018. The values of coefficients of determination (R-2), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and relative root mean squared error values, were 0.78, 0.87, 9.59, and 0.76, respectively, for the Cubist and 0.78, 0.86, 9.79, and 0.78, respectively, for RF models. The slope of the linear fitting equation was higher for the Cubist model (0.75) than for RF (0.69). The explanatory power of Cubist and RF for soil salinity variation were 33.22\% and 31.41\% in the agroecosystem, and 72.25\% and 71.66\% in desert-oasis ecotone, respectively. For the agroecosystem, the range of the predicted values for 89.13\% (Cubist) and 84.78\% (RF) of sample was controlled within the same observational range at an interval of 0-5 dS m(-1). Compared to single-year data (from 2013 to( )2018), the ability to account for model spatial variability in soil salinity based on multi-year Landsat images was increased by 16\%-35\%. According to the variable importance evaluation, soil-related indices are the most important predictor variables, followed by vegetation, topography, landform, and land use, with relative importance values of 60\%, 21\%, 16\%, and 3\%, respectively. The predicted map was also broadly consistent with those obtained for Xinjiang in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) from the second national soil survey of China conducted from 1984 to 1997. The results also showed that the average value of the study area is 8.10 dS m(-1) based on the Cubist-based map whereas that of the HWSD is 10.60 dS m(-1), this implied that the overall salinity level has reduced by 23.58\%. The methodological framework presented covers all prediction process steps and has considerable potential to be used in future soil salinity mapping at large scales for other similar region as OADoEs. The map derived from the Cubist/RF model revealed more detailed variation information about spatial distribution of the soil salinity compared to HWSD, and can further assist with decision-making when planning and utilising on existing soil and water resources in OADoEs.

TI  - Cagriculture Landscape Planning Based On Biotop Area Factor In Yunlin, Taiwan
JO  - 32nd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2011, ACRS 2011
PY  - 2011
AB  - Agriculture has been the primary industry in Yunlin area for hundreds years. It contributes to industrial and living landscape which continuously represents vivid cultural landscape of the area. The strategies of landscape planning in Yunlin area not only emphasis on improving landscape and environment, but also focus on sustaining agricultural culture through landscape planning. In addition, ecological consideration and adapt-for-environment land use guidelines should be applied for local environmental development in order to meet the goal of sustainable environment planning. In this case, Yunlin area's local industries and economy can continuously develop in the process of landscape improvement considering social, economic, and ecological dimensions. The strategies demonstrate the concept of green infrastructure (G.I.). Therefore, this study uses biotope area factor (BAF) to analyse environmental resource of Yunlin area in order to contribute to agricultural landscape planning. The results show: 1)Yunlin area can be categorised into different sub-area of land use according to BAF. The categories include agriculture land, forest land, transportation land, water conservancy land, building land, public infrastructure land, recreation and leisure land, mining land, and the land for other use. 2)The calculated BAF value of Yunlin area is 0.6 which shows large proportion of green space. 3)The major landscape development strategy is increasing BAF value. This could be achieved by infrastructure development strategies of Public land and the expected BAF value would be 0.8.

TI  - Earthquake-Induced Change Detection In The 2003 Bam, Iran, Earthquake By Complex Analysis Using Envisat Asar Data
JO  - EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA
PY  - 2005
AB  - The recently deployed Envisat satellite collected before- and after-event imagery on the Bam, Iran, earthquake that occurred on 26 December 2003. The majority of buildings in Bam were traditional one-story unreinforced adobe structures constructed of the indigenous land material of the region. As a result, the corresponding SAR imagery for Bam reflects less material dependence on object detection. For this study, two sets of before and after SAR data are used from theASAR sensor onboard of the Envisat platform. The backscattering, complex coherence, self-power and cross-power values are computed for each respective co-registered data pairs. The change detection scheme evaluates these results using orbital information to assess the levels of change in different city zones. Such damage maps can potentially serve in disaster response/management and also in estimating economic losses (Eguchi et al. 2000 ). Damage maps from field observations are used to validate these findings.

JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2012
AB  - As the massive tsunami that struck northeast Japan in 11 March 2011 after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake, it reveals that people are living in a critical environment. Although great improvement has been achieved in disaster prevention technologies, many natural disasters are still unpredictable. In addition to the prevention, rapid and effective responses to such disasters are also crucial. One of the key elements to success is the information dissemination of disaster, including both area and people living within that region. In the past decade, web-based spatial information system has become the major platform for both data sharing and displaying. What is coming next is the development of web-based spatial data analysis. A web-based service allows people to implement spatial analysis immediately as long as the internet connection among database and application servers is available. This useful and helpful spatial information is able to be accessed by all users around the world almost simultaneously. The main goal of this paper is to implement a spatial data analysis module based on service oriented architecture (SOA) concept. The main interest and focus of our study is based on the knowledge regularization processes of spatial data analysis to achieve the automated land cover change detection (LCCD) over internet. The proposed automated model is tested and verified by FORMOSAT-2 imageries taken in 2005 and in 2008. It will be published online for users around the world to maximize the add-on value and minimize the cost of the spatial data, moreover, to reveal the situations of disaster rapidly.

A number of erroneous elements have been identified in this report leading to the conclusion in this paper that the spectrum requirements for IMT are greatly overestimated. The mobile industry, supported by some national administrations, has formally proposed the estimated amount of spectrum in the Report ITU-R M.2290 to be allocated to mobile services at the WRC-15. No cost/benefit analysis and no impact assessment on the existing spectrum users have been provided to support this proposal. If the WRC-15 decides to satisfy these requirements, the incumbent users of the affected frequency bands will have to be displaced. This would most certainly have an adverse impact on terrestrial broadcasting, satellite services, the cultural and content industries, and society in general.

TI  - Comparison Of Boosted Regression Tree And Random Forest Models For Mapping Topsoil Organic Carbon Concentration In An Alpine Ecosystem
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2016
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration, and a better understanding of the spatial patterns of SOC is essential for soil resource management. In this study, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models to map the distribution of topsoil organic carbon content at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A set 01 105 soil samples and 12 environmental variables (including topography, climate and vegetation) were analyzed. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Maps of the mean values and standard deviations of SOC were generated to illustrate model variability and uncertainty. The results indicate that the BRT and RF models exhibited very similar performance and yielded similar predicted distributions of SOC. The two models explained approximately 70\% of the total SOC variability. The BRT and RF models robustly predicted the SOC at low observed SOC values, whereas they underestimated high observed SOC values. This underestimation may have been caused by biased distributions of soil samples in the SOC space. Vegetation-related variables were assigned the highest importance in both models, followed by climate and topography. Both models produced spatial distribution maps of SOC that were closely related to vegetation cover. The SOC content predicted by the BRT model was clearly higher than that of the RF model in areas with greater vegetation cover because the contributions of vegetation-related variables in the two models (65\% and 43\%, respectively) differed significantly. The predicted SOC content increased from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the study area, average values produced by the BRT and RF models were 27.3 g kg(-1) and 26.6 g kg(-1), respectively. We conclude that the BRT and RF methods should be calibrated and compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC spatial distribution in similar regions. In addition, vegetation variables, including those obtained from remote sensing imagery, should be taken as the main environmental indicators and explicitly included when generating SOC maps in Alpine environments.

TI  - Population Density Of Red Langurs In Sabangau Tropical Peat-Swamp Forest, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
JO  - American Journal of Primatology
PY  - 2013
AB  - Because of the large-scale destruction of Borneo's rainforests on mineral soils, tropical peat-swamp forests (TPSFs) are increasingly essential for conserving remnant biodiversity, particularly in the lowlands where the majority of habitat conversion has occurred. Consequently, effective strategies for biodiversity conservation are required, which rely on accurate population density and distribution estimates as a baseline. We sought to establish the first population density estimates of the endemic red langur (Presbytis rubicunda) in Sabangau TPSF, the largest remaining contiguous lowland forest-block on Borneo. Using Distance sampling principles, we conducted line transect surveys in two of Sabangau's three principle habitat sub-classes and calculated group density at 2.52groupskm-2 (95% CI 1.56-4.08) in the mixed-swamp forest sub-class. Based on an average recorded group size of 6.95 individuals, population density was 17.51indkm-2, the second highest density recorded in this species. The accessible area of the tall-interior forest, however, was too disturbed to yield density estimates representative of the entire sub-class, and P. rubicunda was absent from the low-pole forest, likely as a result of the low availability of the species' preferred foods. This absence in 30% of Sabangau's total area indicates the importance of in situ population surveys at the habitat-specific level for accurately informing conservation strategies. We highlight the conservation value of TPSFs for P. rubicunda given the high population density and large areas remaining, and recommend 1) quantifying the response of P. rubicunda to the logging and burning of its habitats; 2) surveying degraded TPSFs for viable populations, and 3) effectively delineating TPSF sub-class boundaries from remote imagery to facilitate population estimates across the wider peat landscape, given the stark contrast in densities found across the habitat sub-classes of Sabangau. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A Protocol For Aerial Survey In Coastal Areas Using Uas
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Aerial surveys in coastal areas using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present many limitations. However, the need for detailed and accurate information in a marine environment has made UAVs very popular. The aim of this paper is to present a protocol which summarizes the parameters that affect the reliability of the data acquisition process over the marine environment using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The proposed UAS Data Acquisition Protocol consists of three main categories: (i) Morphology of the study area, (ii) Environmental conditions, (iii) Flight parameters. These categories include the parameters prevailing in the study area during a UAV mission and affect the quality of marine data. Furthermore, a UAS toolbox, which combines forecast weather data values with predefined thresholds and calculates the optimal flight window times in a day, was developed. The UAS toolbox was tested in two case studies with data acquisition over a coastal study area. The first UAS survey was operated under optimal conditions while the second was realized under non-optimal conditions. The acquired images and the produced orthophoto maps from both surveys present significant differences in quality. Moreover, a comparison between the classified maps of the case studies showed the underestimation of some habitats in the area at the non-optimal survey day. The UAS toolbox is expected to contribute to proper flight planning in marine applications. The UAS protocol can provide valuable information for mapping, monitoring, and management of the coastal and marine environment, which can be used globally in research and a variety of marine applications.

TI  - Population Weighted Raster Maps Can Communicate Findings Of Social Audits: Examples From Three Continents
JO  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Maps can portray trends, patterns, and spatial differences that might be overlooked in tabular data and are now widely used in health research. Little has been reported about the process of using maps to communicate epidemiological findings. Method: Population weighted raster maps show colour changes over the study area. Similar to the rasters of barometric pressure in a weather map, data are the health occurrence - a peak on the map represents a higher value of the indicator in question. The population relevance of each sentinel site, as determined in the stratified last stage random sample, combines with geography (inverse-distance weighting) to provide a population-weighted extension of each colour. This transforms the map to show population space rather than simply geographic space. Results: Maps allowed discussion of strategies to reduce violence against women in a context of political sensitivity about quoting summary indicator figures. Time-series maps showed planners how experiences of health services had deteriorated despite a reform programme; where in a country HIV risk behaviours were improving; and how knowledge of an economic development programme quickly fell off across a region. Change maps highlighted where indicators were improving and where they were deteriorating. Maps of potential impact of interventions, based on multivariate modelling, displayed how partial and full implementation of programmes could improve outcomes across a country. Scale depends on context. To support local planning, district maps or local government authority maps of health indicators were more useful than national maps; but multinational maps of outcomes were more useful for regional institutions. Mapping was useful to illustrate in which districts enrolment in religious schools - a rare occurrence - was more prevalent. Conclusions: Population weighted raster maps can present social audit findings in an accessible and compelling way, increasing the use of evidence by planners with limited numeracy skills or little time to look at evidence. Maps complement epidemiological analysis, but they are not a substitute. Much less do they substitute for rigorous epidemiological designs, like randomised controlled trials.

TI  - Remote Sensing For The Analysis Of Anthropogenic Geomorphology: Potential Responses To Sediment Dynamics In The Agricultural Landscapes
JO  - Developments in Earth Surface Processes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Agricultural modern land transformations are usually undertaken with minimal landscape planning, and soil conservation practices are largely ignored during the construction phase. As a consequence, changes to terrain morphology induce dramatic geomorphological effects that can endure well beyond any single farming cycle and over many human generations. Thus, agricultural activities that may not be obvious to the observers of contemporary landscapes can continue to influence surface processes and landforms strongly; these effects are even more critical in the current situation of climate change and rainfall event intensification. An understanding and successful prediction of pathways of runoff and associated soil erosion due to terracing are, therefore, of considerable societal relevance. Such predictions would allow improvements to the protection of the environment by the reduction of impacts of the agricultural activities or by a correct restoration of abandoned agricultural land (especially terraces). Using two examples from northern Spain and northern Italy, this chapter shows how new remote sensing technologies (i.e., airborne lidar), available to the public, can provide a better understanding of the interaction between anthropogenic elements, potential erosion, and the associated sediment delivery. During the planning and management phase, the farmers and authorities in charge of monitoring both the subsidy process and land management should consider an approach similar to that presented in this research, together with a holistic view of the processes in the areas, specifically related to climate and soil. It is currently possible to forecast how agricultural practices could affect sediment fluxes in the future, and thus to have a better understanding of the human-landscape interactions. This type of integrated analysis is a cost-effective strategy for the management, restoration, or development of terraced lands, especially in areas with high economic value for agricultural productions and tourism. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Novel Viewpoint To The Green City Concept Based On Vegetation Area Changes And Contributions To Healthy Days: A Case Study Of Mashhad, Iran
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - One of the significant challenges in urbanization is the air pollution. This highlights the need of the green city concept with reconsideration of houses, factories, and traffic in a green viewpoint. The literature review confirms that this reconsideration for green space has a positive effect on the air quality of large cities and to reduce the air pollution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the annual vegetation changes in the green space of Mashhad, Iran as a very populated city in the middle east to study the air pollution. To investigate the relationship between the air pollution and vegetation, the Landsat 8 satellite images for summer seasons of 2013-2019 were used to extract changes in vegetation by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). The main contribution in comparison with the relevant studies is to study the relationship between clean, healthy, and unhealthy days with the green space area for the first time in Mashhad, Iran. The results show that the implementation of green city concept in Mashhad, Iran, has been increased by 64, 81, and 53\% by NDVI, EVI, and OSAVI, respectively, during the study period. The vegetation area of this city is positively correlated to clean and healthy days and has a negative correlation to unhealthy days, in which the greatest values for NDVI, EVI and OSAVI are 0.33, 0.52, and -0.53, respectively.

TI  - Modeling And Mapping Forest Biomass Using Forest Inventory And Landsat Tm Data: Results From The Foothills Model Forest, Alberta
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2002
AB  - Forest biomass information is needed for reporting of selected indicators of sustainable forest management and for models that estimate carbon budgets and forest productivity, particularly within the context of a changing climate. In collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency, a strategy for mapping Canada's forest biomass has been developed as part of the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) project. This paper reports on the results derived from an application of this strategy to a pilot study area in the Foothills Model Forest, Alberta. Methods to estimate forest biomass have been developed using tree-level inventory plot data that is then extrapolated to the stand level by statistical relationships between biomass density and stand structural characteristics. These ground-based biomass estimates serve as source data that are related to stand structure derived from classified Landsat TM data. Models developed from inventory data to estimate biomass density attained adjusted R2 values that ranged from 0.60 to 0.77 for 5 species groups, and tests with an independent validation sample compared favourably for all species (deciduous, lodgepole pine, mixed species, white spruce/fir), except black spruce/larch. Landsat-derived forest biomass was statistically and moderately correlated to the inventory-derived biomass with values of 0.63, 0.68, and 0.70 for conifer, deciduous, and mixed species, respectively. Research areas were identified from both inventory and remote sensing perspectives that will lead to incremental improvements in biomass estimation.

TI  - An Integrated District Mapping Strategy For Loiasis To Enable Safe Mass Treatment For Onchocerciasis In Gabon
JO  - American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene
PY  - 2022
AB  - The lack of a WHO-recommended strategy for onchocerciasis treatment with ivermectin in hypo-endemic areas co-endemic with loiasis is an impediment to global onchocerciasis elimination. New loiasis diagnostics (LoaScope; Loa antibody rapid test) and risk prediction tools may enable safe mass treatment decisions in co-endemic areas. In 2017-2018, an integrated mapping strategy for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis (LF), and loiasis, aimed at enabling safe ivermectin treatment decisions, was piloted in Gabon. Three ivermectin-naïve departments suspected to be hypoendemic were selected and up to 100 adults per village across 30 villages in each of the three departments underwent testing for indicators of onchocerciasis, LF, and loiasis. An additional 67 communities in five adjoining departments were tested for loiasis to extend the prevalence and intensity predictions and possibly expand the boundaries of areas deemed safe for ivermectin treatment. Integrated testing in the three departments revealed within-department heterogeneity for all the three diseases, highlighting the value of a mapping approach that relies on cluster-based sampling rather than sentinel sites. These results suggest that safe mass treatment of onchocerciasis may be possible at the subdepartment level, even in departments where loiasis is present. Beyond valuable epidemiologic data, the study generated insight into the performance of various diagnostics and the feasibility of an integrated mapping approach utilizing new diagnostic and modeling tools. Further research should explore how programs can combine these diagnostic and risk prediction tools into a feasible programmatic strategy to enable safe treatment decisions where loiasis and onchocerciasis are co-endemic. © 2022 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

TI  - Use Of Open, Spatial And Satellite Data For The Purpose Of Researching Landfills For Municipal
JO  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
PY  - 2023
AB  - The present work traces the development of an illegal landfill near the town of Svoge in Bulgaria. After 2016, a waste management plan is prepared on the territory of the municipality and a decision is made to dispose of it by depositing it in a regional landfill for municipal waste in the town of Kostinbrod. The aim of the study is to trace the development of biochemical processes that took place on the territory of the former landfill and whether their impact continues to this day. Data from the Open Data Portal (https://data.egov.bg/), the National Spatial Data Portal INSPIRE (https://inspire.egov.bg/bg), satellite data and GIS, several spectral profiles and indices such as Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) were used. Composite images from the multispectral instrument (MSI) of the Sentinel 2 platform and radar (SAR) from the Sentinel 1 platform of the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency were used. The surface temperature of the landfill was calculated using the heat channels from the Landsat 5-7 (ETM) and Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 (OLI / TIRS) sensors. A combination of radar and optical data was made. Data from different seasons and years were used to monitor the dynamics of thermal pollution in the study area. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the territory on which the landfill is located has been made. Last but not least, the role of high-value open data in environmental monitoring has been demonstrated, which will reduce the administrative burden of making responsible decisions for each smaller municipality and will be successfully implemented in future methodologies for improving Digital twins through technical work in Destination Earth (DestinE) and information about any point, area or globally significant territories.

TI  - Exploring Groundwater Quality Assessment: A Geostatistical And Integrated Water Quality Indices Perspective
JO  - Water (Switzerland)
PY  - 2024
AB  - Groundwater is an important source of freshwater. At the same time, anthropogenic activities, in particular, industrialization, urbanization, population growth, and excessive application of fertilizers, are some of the major reasons for groundwater quality deterioration. Therefore, the present study is conducted to evaluate groundwater quality by using integrated water quality indices and a geospatial approach to identify the different water quality zones and propose management strategies for the improvement of groundwater quality. Groundwater quality was evaluated through the physicochemical parameters (pH, chloride (Cl−), fluoride(F−), iron (Fe−2), nitrate (NO3−1), nitrite (NO2), arsenic (As), total hardness, bicarbonate (HCO3−), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), color, taste, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS)) and microbiological parameters including total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli of samples collected from the water and sanitation agency (WASA) and urban units. Irrigation parameters crucial to the assessment, including (electrical conductivity (EC), residual sodium carbonates (RSC), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)), were also collected at more than 1100 sites within the study area of upper and central Punjab. After collecting the data of physicochemical parameters, the analysis of data was initiated to compute the water quality index for groundwater quality, a four-step protocol in which the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine the weights of selected parameters by generating a pairwise matrix, on the relative importance of parameters using the Satty scale. The index was then classified into five classes for quality assessment of drinking water (excellent, good, medium, bad, and very bad) and four classes for irrigation water quality assessment (excellent, good, permissible, and unsuitable). After computing the index values for drinking as well as irrigation purposes, the values were interpolated, and various maps were developed to identify the status of groundwater quality in different zones of the study area. Mitigation strategies for water pollution involve source control, such as monitoring industrial discharge points and managing waste properly. Additionally, treating wastewater through primary, secondary, or tertiary stages significantly improves water quality, reducing contaminants like heavy metals, microbiological agents, and chemical ions, safeguarding water resources. The findings highlight significant regional variations in water quality issues, with heavy metal concerns concentrated notably in Lahore and widespread emerging microbiological contamination across all studied divisions. This suggests a systemic problem linked to untreated industrial effluents and poorly managed sewerage systems. The computed indices for the Lahore, Sargodha, and Rawalpindi divisions indicate water quality ranging from marginal to unfit, underscoring the urgency for remediation. Conversely, other divisions fall within a medium class, potentially suitable for drinking purposes. Notably, microbiological contamination at 27% poses a major challenge for water supply agencies, emphasizing the critical need for pre-disposal primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments. These treatments could potentially rehabilitate 9%, 35%, and 41% of the study area, respectively, pointing toward tangible, scalable solutions critical for safeguarding broader water resources and public health. With the current pace of water quality deterioration, access to drinking water is a major problem for the public. The government should prioritize implementing strict monitoring mechanisms for industrial effluent discharge, emphasizing proper waste management to curb groundwater contamination. Establishing comprehensive pre-disposal treatments, especially primary, secondary, and tertiary stages, is imperative to address the prevalent heavy metal and microbiological issues, potentially rehabilitating up to 41% of affected areas. Additionally, creating proactive policies and allocating resources or sustainable groundwater management are crucial steps for ensuring broader water resource security and public health in the face of deteriorating water quality. Therefore, urgent regional action is needed to address escalating anthropogenic threats to groundwater, emphasizing the crucial need for proactive measures to safeguard public health and ensure sustainable water resources. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Observation Constrained Aromatic Emissions In Shanghai, China
JO  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Aromatics in the atmosphere are a large contributor to ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation and have an adverse impact on human health. Observation-based emissions are urgently needed for air quality management and decision making due to the large uncertainties in the emissions inventories. Atmospheric aromatics were continuously observed at one urban site in Shanghai of China in 2015, which were compared with the simulations of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Large differences were found in the temporal variations between the model and measurements, corroborating with previous studies that the current bottom-up emission inventories are highly biased. We corrected the aromatic emissions biases of the emission inventories using the observations with the CMAQ simulations, with the assumption that the response relationship of the emissions input and aromatic concentrations was reasonable on a monthly basis in CMAQ simulations, suggesting that the results are dependent on the model performance. The resulting aromatic emissions exhibited clear monthly variations, increasing from 5.5 2.1 Gg month(-1) in February to 17.4 7.7 Gg month(-1) in July, being different from the flat monthly pattern in the current bottom-up emissions inventory. Toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene dominated aromatic emissions, accounting for similar to 74\% on average but with considerable monthly variations, which was different from the nearly uniform value of 77\% throughout the whole year in the emissions inventory. These highly temporally resolved and speciated in situ aromatics measurements provide observation-based constraints on aromatic emissions, which cannot be obtained from satellite measurements. This study proposes a top-down emission estimation method constrained by ambient measurements.

TI  - Assessment Of Carbon Intensity Of The Tatarstan Economy For Environmental Management
JO  - Vestnik Moskovskogo Universiteta, Seriya 5: Geografiya
PY  - 2021
AB  - The paper presents the results of assessing the carbon intensity of the economy at a regional level based on the approach developed by the authors. The attempts to optimize the environmental management are often associated with the transition to a "low-carbon" economy, but the reduction of carbon intensity is considered mainly from the economic point of view. However, the structure of land use is an important factor of low-carbon development. The proposed approach allows comparing the intensity of natural and anthropogenic carbon flows, with due account of the absorption capacity of forests and agricultural land. The IPCC guidelines for greenhouse gas inventory were used to assess the carbon intensity and the contribution of forests and agricultural land to carbon dioxide sequestration was estimated using the Guidelines for quantifying greenhouse gases absorption by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment The project was carried out for the Republic of Tatarstan. The calculations are based on the official data on fuel volumes used by economic sectors and administrative regions of Tatarstan, as well as the data on land use structure, verified with the satellite images. The region has a diversified structure of economy and land use. The amount of COj emissions and the absorption capacity of natural and transformed landscapes were estimated within the boundaries of administrative regions and correlated to the gross territorial product (GTP). The resulting values of the carbon balance and differentiation of this indicator over the territory of the region allows conclusions about the natural landscapes potential to compensate the economic activities pressure. The potential of natural systems significantly exceeds the anthropogenic load in the areas whh a "positive" carbon balance, while in the areas with a "negative" carbon balance C 0 2 emissions exceed the capacity of natural systems to absorb it. Thus, the carbon intensity as an indicator of environment impact is a promising direction for the development of integrated environmental and economic assessment of the results of nature management at the regional level. Comparison of the carbon intensity with the carbon sequestration potential could be used to improve the structure of land use for environmental management purposes. © 2021 Moskovskij Universitet.

TI  - The Influence Of Deforestation On Land Surface Temperature-A Case Study Of Perak And Kedah, Malaysia
JO  - FORESTS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid change in forest and land cover, especially in tropical forests due to massive deforestation. The major factor responsible for the changes is to fulfill the growing demand of increasing population through agricultural intensification, rural settlements, and urbanization. Monitoring forest cover and vegetation are essential for detecting regional and global environmental changes. The present study evaluates the influence of deforestation on land surface temperature (LST) in the states of Kedah and Perak, Malaysia, between 1988 and 2017. The trend in forest cover change over the time span of 29 years, was analyzed using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images to map the sequence of forest cover change. With the measurement of deforestation and its relationship with LST as an end goal, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine forest health, and the spectral radiance model was used to extract the LST. The findings of the study show that nearly 16\% (189,423 ha) of forest cover in Perak and more than 9\% (33,391 ha) of forest cover in Kedah have disappeared within these 29 years as a result of anthropogenic activities. The correlation between the LST and NDVI is related to the distribution of forests, where LST is inversely related to NDVI. A strong correlation between LST and NDVI was observed in this study, where the average mean of LST in Kedah (25 degrees C) is higher than in Perak (22.6 degrees C). This is also reflected by the decreased NDVI value from 0.6 to 0.5 in 2017 at both states. This demonstrated that a decrease in the vegetation area leads to an increase in the surface temperature. The resultant forest change map would be helpful for forest management in terms of identifying highly vulnerable areas. Moreover, it could help the local government to formulate a land management plan.

TI  - A Scoping Review Of Real-Time Automated Clinical Deterioration Alerts And Evidence Of Impacts On Hospitalised Patient Outcomes
JO  - BMJ Quality and Safety
PY  - 2022
AB  - Background Hospital patients experiencing clinical deterioration are at greater risk of adverse events. Monitoring patients through early warning systems is widespread, despite limited published evidence that they improve patient outcomes. Current limitations including infrequent or incorrect risk calculations may be mitigated by integration into electronic medical records. Our objective was to examine the impact on patient outcomes of systems for detecting and responding to real-time, automated alerts for clinical deterioration. Methods This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. We searched Medline, CINAHL and Embase for articles implementing real-time, automated deterioration alerts in hospitalised adults evaluating one or more patient outcomes including intensive care unit admission, length of stay, in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and in-hospital death. Results Of 639 studies identified, 18 were included in this review. Most studies did not report statistically significant associations between alert implementation and better patient outcomes. Four studies reported statistically significant improvements in two or more patient outcomes, and were the only studies to directly involve the patient's clinician. However, only one of these four studies was robust to existing trends in patient outcomes. Of the six studies using robust study designs, one reported a statistically significant improvement in patient outcomes; the rest did not detect differences. Conclusions Most studies in this review did not detect improvements in patient outcomes following the implementation of real-time deterioration alerts. Future implementation studies should consider: directly involving the patient's physician or a dedicated surveillance nurse in structured response protocols for deteriorating patients; the workflow of alert recipients; and incorporating model features into the decision process to improve clinical utility. ©

TI  - The Effect Of Habitat Degradation On The Long Term Survival Of The Critically Endangered Madagascar Spider Tortoise (Pyxis Arachnoides)
JO  - Biological Conservation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Pyxis arachnoides inhabits the dry, coastal forests of southwest Madagascar; a biologically unique ecoregion severely threatened by unsustainable small scale agricultural practices. Using remotely sensed data we established vegetation loss remains unabated within our study area at 1.2% year -1; consistent with ecoregion wide vegetation loss between 1990 and 2000. We monitored tortoise population density on four occasions over 8years and developed a stage class projection matrix to model the finite growth rate, matrix sensitivities and elasticities of the population. Monitoring revealed an actual mean population decline of 10.8% between 2003 and 2011. Our projection matrix model suggested the finite rate of growth to be λ=0.986, indicative of 1.4% year -1 decline for the duration of the existence of the population, with adult survival as the most sensitive parameter to overall survival of the population. Projection modeling suggests that the population would possibly become functionally non viable in approximately 170years. As our study was heavily reliant on the use of surrogate data, more information is needed on pre-adult survival and wild reproductive rates. Our study site currently represents a population of exceptional density, therefore, other less dense populations, subjected to the further stresses of poaching will likely become functionally non viable much sooner. This study highlights the utility of population projection matrices in determining the vulnerability of chelonians; a globally threatened taxon. In the case of the spider tortoise, well coordinated development programs and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers forcing this species closer to extinction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Role Of Tree Landscape To Reduce Effects Of Urban Heat Islands: A Study In Two Brazilian Cities
JO  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
PY  - 2023
AB  - The growth of large cities has, in its relationship with the natural environment, caused environmental impacts that have severely transformed the local climate and influenced human well-being. The purpose of this research was to examine the variation of temperature using remote sensing, seeking to identify urban heat islands and the spatial distribution of the green infrastructure, focusing on urban trees. Curitiba was selected for this study, because the city received in 1990 the United Nations Environment Program award and is considered the "Ecological Capital" of Brazil. On the other hand, Sao Paulo was selected, because it is the largest city in South America. Landsat satellite images on vegetation coverage and urban thermic comfort index methods were used to track the hotter regions and greenery all over the cities. The benefits of urban trees were also estimated by i-Tree Canopy with regard to improve air quality. Besides protected areas, mainly where there are urban fragments of forest, some high-income neighborhoods are benefited by the green cover. The results highlighted that both cities, Curitiba and Sao Paulo, require effective governance practices to produce patterns of environmental justice, implementing green spaces in a balanced way for the population.

TI  - Multi-Mission Indian Earth Observation Scenario: Evolving Process Standard For Addressing The User Needs
JO  - International Astronautical Federation - 58th International Astronautical Congress 2007
PY  - 2007
AB  - Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme since its inception has been application driven. It has evolved from experimental satellites, operational satellites to present generation of theme specific satellites. Theme specific EO satellites have been categorized in three categories: Land, Cartography and Ocean and Atmosphere theme observation satellites. Indian EO capabilities has increased manifold. Improvements are not only in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution but also in their coverage and value added products. In the coming 10 years, India has planned more than 20 satellites carrying imaging and non-imaging sensors with varieties of capabilities and complexities. It will have microwave, hyperspectral, stereo viewing, high resolution imaging from geo-synchronous platform etc., which will fulfill the present and future gap areas in EO applications. A variety of data products will be obtained from multiple missions for multiple themes with emphasis on actionable products and services. In order to realize these missions and derive maximum benefits, a number of areas related to ground segment need to be addressed like multi-mission acquisition and processing, effective delivery mechanisms, real time web-based services and mission oriented outreach activities. A comprehensive standardization effort is called for to acquire, manage, process and disseminate these datasets to meet the various application requirements and user needs, like global change applications, mapping and cartographic applications, natural resources and environmental management applications and disaster management. For example, in generating the spatial information, satellite images and maps form the foundation and basis for most planning and implementation of various natural resources management/environmental applications. Hence, standardization is a must in systematic spatial dataset creation at various stages in the total process of spatial information generation upto its final delivery that enables uniformity and flexibility in mapping and GIS database organization. These standards enable technologies - imaging and GIS applications - thematic mapping, services and outputs etc. to work together, increase interoperability, brings systematization and automation of mapping and GIS so that it will generate the actionable products and services. Again, for dissemination of spatial data and application services, effective delivery mechanism need to be worked out which will be on real time basis, easily accessible and faster to achieve the critical needs of weather forecasting, disaster monitoring etc. The present paper brings out about glimpse of various applications and beneficiaries, various elements of standardization in the area of EO data, maps, applications, database organization and delivery mechanism in order to cater the various users applications where importance of having satellite data and timeliness is very important.

TI  - Integrated Landscape Analyses Of Change Of Miombo Woodland In Tanzania And Its Implication For Environment And Human Livelihood
JO  - Geografiska Annaler, Series A: Physical Geography
PY  - 2009
AB  - Landscapes bear witness to past and present natural and societal processes influencing the environment and human livelihoods. By analysing landscape change at different spatial scales over time the effects on the environment and human livelihoods of various external and internal driving forces of change can be studied. This paper presents such an analysis of miombo woodland surrounding the Mkata plains in central Tanzania. The rich natural landscape diversity of the study area in combination with its historical and political development makes it an ideal observation ground for this kind of study. The paper focuses on long-term physical and biological changes, mainly based on satellite information but also on field studies and a review of documents and literature. The miombo woodlands are highly dynamic semi-arid ecosystems found on a number of nutrient-poor soil groups. Most of the woodlands are related to an old, low-relief geomorphology of erosion surfaces with relatively deep and leached soils, or to a lesser extent also on escarpments and steep Inselberg slopes with poor soils. Each period in the past has cast its footprints on the landscape development and its potential for a sustainable future use. On a regional level there has been a continual decrease in forest area over time. Expansion of agriculture around planned villages, implemented during the 1970s, in some cases equals the loss of forest area (Mikumi-Ulaya), whilst in other areas (Kitulangalo), the pre-independence loss of woodland was small; the agricultural area was almost the same during the period 1975-1999, despite the fact that forests have been lost at an almost constant rate over the same period. Illegal logging and charcoal production are likely causes because of the proximity to the main highway running through the area. Contrasting to the general regional pattern are the conditions in a traditional village (Ihombwe), with low immigration of people and a maintained knowledge of the resource potential of the forest with regards to edible plants and animals. In this area the local community has control of the forest resources in a Forest Reserve, within which the woody vegetation has increased in spite of an expansion of agriculture on other types of village land. The mapping procedure has shown that factors such as access to transport and lack of local control have caused greater deforestation of certain areas than during the colonial period. Planned villages have furthermore continued to expand over forest areas well after their implementation, rapidly increasing the landscape fragmentation. One possible way to maintain landscape and biodiversity values is by the sustainable use of traditional resources, based on local knowledge of their management as illustrated by the little change observed in the traditionally used area. © 2009 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.

TI  - On-Board Model-Based Fault Diagnosis For Autonomous Proximity Operations
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2018
AB  - Because of their complexity and the unforgiving environment in which they operate, aerospace vehicles often require autonomous systems to respond to mission-critical failures. Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) systems are used to detect, identify the source of, and recover from faults. Typically, FDIR systems use a rule-based paradigm for fault detection, where telemetry values are monitored against specific logical statements such as static upper and lower limits. The model-based paradigm allows more complex decision logic to be used for FDIR. This study focuses on a state machine approach toward model-based FDIR. The state machine approach is increasingly utilized for FDIR of complex systems because it is intuitive, logic-based, and simple to interpret visually. In current practice, the detection of specific symptoms is directly mapped to the appropriate response for a pre-diagnosed fault, as determined by FDIR engineers at design time. This study advances the state-of-the-art in state machine fault protection by developing an on-board diagnostic system that will assess symptoms, isolate fault sources, and select corrective actions based on models of system behavior. This state machine architecture for FDIR is applicable for a broad range of aerospace vehicles and mission scenarios. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the FDIR approach, two case studies are evaluated for scenarios in very different domains. The first is a terrestrial application involving the use of multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The second is a space-based scenario involving autonomous proximity operations for orbital capture of a Mars Sample Return capsule. The efficacy of the state machine FDIR system is demonstrated via flight testing for the UAV case study and through software-in-the-loop testing in a flight-like simulation environment for the Mars Sample Return case. In each case, the FDIR system is focused on the Guidance, Navigation and Control subsystem. This approach has been successfully shown to detect, diagnose, and respond to faults during testing. State machines allow the autonomous system to handle distinct faults with identical symptoms for initial detection. Each fault has a separate diagnosis and response procedure, and the proper procedure is selected by the state machine. This study demonstrates how a fault protection system may diagnose these faults on-board rather than relying upon a priori ground diagnosis.

TI  - Temporal And Spatial Variations Of Irrigation Water Use For Commercial Corn Fields In Central Nebraska
JO  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - The increasing pressure on water resources in Nebraska-US and other agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions for the governance of water resources and the analysis of water use efficiency. In this vein, this paper presents the application of a remote sensing based soil water balance for the study of water use in agricultural areas. The specific objectives were the identification of the temporal and spatial behavior of the irrigation water use based on the quantification of the water use deviation (irrigation water applied minus irrigation water requirements), as the main indicator and the comparative analysis of the irrigation productivity (crop yield under irrigated field minus crop yield under rainfed condition per volume of water applied by irrigation), WPi, water productivity (harvestable grain per total volume of water applied considering precipitation plus irrigation), WP, and finally water productivity based on evapotranspiration (harvested grain per total volume of water evapotranspired), WPET, in the various management zones analyzed. Additionally, we examined the impact of soil types, local weather and irrigation system (center pivot and furrow irrigation) on these indicators. The study was carried out in three Natural Resources District (Tri-Basin, Central Platte and Lower Niobrara) across Central Nebraska for the period 2004-2012 and comprised over 2000 irrigated corn fields per year. Crop water requirements were estimated using the reflectance-based crop coefficient approach developed in previous research (see Campos et al., 2017) and the field data were reported for each field monitored through cropland data layer by National Agricultural Statistics Service of USDA. The difference between modeled irrigation water requirements and field level irrigation application was significant (p < 0.001) being the water use deviation in generally positive (over irrigation). These results were consistently higher for furrow irrigated fields during the whole analyzed period, reaching up to three times more water applied compared to the required amount. This was expected as surface irrigation systems typically require a higher application depth. This trend changed for the central pivot irrigated fields depending on the climatic conditions, especially in dry years. The analysis of the water use deviation with respect to soil types and weather conditions revealed that the water use deviation is not justified by the biophysical conditions alone. The estimated values of WP and WPi for furrow system was lower compared to center pivot in both NRD's reaching the maximum value of 1.37 kg m(-3) and 3.06 kg m(-3) for WP and WPi in Tri-basin respectively for center pivot. In general, the results suggested potential to improve water management in these NRDs in Central Nebraska and reduce pumping potentially saving groundwater resources for drought years and other uses monitoring soil type, weather data and switching to sprinklers system.

TI  - Key Factors, Planning Strategy And Policy For Low-Carbon Transport Development In Developing Cities Of China
JO  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
PY  - 2022
AB  - Exploring key impact factors and their effects on urban residents’ transport carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is significant for effective low-carbon transport planning. Researchers face the model uncertainty problem to seek a rational and better explanatory model and the key variables in the model set containing various factors after they are arranged and combined. This paper uses the Bayesian Model Averaging method to solve the above problem, explore the key variables, and determine their relative significance and averaging effects. Beijing, Xi’an, and Wuhan are selected as three case cities for their representation of developing Chinese cities. We found that the initial key factor increasing transport emissions is the high dependence on cars, and the second is the geographical location factor that much more suburban residents suffer longer commuting. Developing satellite city rank first for reducing transport emissions due to more local trips with an average short distance, the second is the metro accessibility, and the third is polycentric form. Key planning strategies and policies are proposed: (i) combining policies of car restriction based on vehicle plate number, encouraging clean fuel cars, a carbon tax on oil uses, and rewarding public transit passengers; (ii) fostering subcenters’ strong industries to develop self-contained polycentric structures and satellite cities, and forming employment and life circle within 5 km radius; and (iii) integrating bus and rail transit services in the peripheral areas and suburbs and increasing the integration level of muti-modes transferring in transport hubs. The findings will offer empirical evidence and reference value in developing cities globally. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluation On Ecosystem Changes And Protection Of The National Key Ecological Function Zones In Mountainous Areas Of Central Hainan Island
JO  - Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica
PY  - 2018
AB  - Ecosystem services have become one of the major aspects of ecosystem management and evaluation. As a key area of ecosystem services, evaluation of ecosystem changes and implementation effect is important for national key ecological function zones. Such evaluation can help to maintain national ecological security, drive the implementation of the main function zone strategy and advance the construction of an ecological civilization. This article explores the ecological zone of a tropical rainforest region in the central mountain area of Hainan Island, China. Multi-source satellite data and ground observation statistics are analyzed with geo-statistics method and ecological assessment model. The core analysis of this paper includes ecosystem pattern, quality and service. By means of spatial and temporal scale expansion and multi-dimensional space-time correlation analysis, we examine the trend and stability characteristics of ecosystem change, and evaluate the implementation effect. The results showed that, first, the forest area ratio was 84.5% in 2013, which was significantly higher than the average level in Hainan Island. During 1990-2013, settlement gradually increased in ecological zone. After the implementation of the function zone in 2010, human activity intensity was still increasing, with the area ratio rising from 0.5% to 0.8%. The main land use change was urban construction and land reclamation. Second, water conservation in the ecological function zone was better than that outside the zone. During 1990-2013, water conservation increased slightly, and had obvious fluctuation in different periods. Water conservation change decreased first and then increased during both the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2013. Water conservation quantity was 0.5178 million cubic metres per square kilometer, which was higher than the average outside the zone. Third, soil conservation in the ecological function zone was also better than that outside the zone. Soil conservation showed dramatic fluctuations and relatively poor stability during 1990-2013. Soil conservation quantity was 19500 tons per square kilometer in the ecological function zone. Fourth, the human disturbance index in the ecological function zone was significantly less than that outside the zone and had lower biodiversity threat level. This would be beneficial to biodiversity conservation. In the ecological function zone, average human disturbance index was 0.3664 and 0.1152 lower than that outside the zone. During 1990-2013, human disturbance index variation range outside the zone was 0.0152, about 5.31 times that of the inner zone. Especially in 2010-2013, the increased range of human disturbance index in the ecological function zone was significantly less than that outside value the zone. © 2018, Science Press.

TI  - Social Responsibility And Environmental Safety Risks Monitoring Of Metallurgical Companies Using An Industrial Approach
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2020
AB  - The study was aimed at monitoring social responsibility and environmental risks of the largest Russian metallurgical companies based on public reports and other sources of information. The methodological basis of the study was the regulatory documents on environmental safety, sustainable development standards in the field of ecology; information and rating agencies data; Internet resources of metallurgical companies, their financial and environmental reports, analytical reviews; works of foreign and Russian scientists on environmental safety issues; monitoring data conducted by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Social responsibility and environmental risks of metallurgical companies monitoring is based on a sectoral approach and identification of their trends. The study included four areas: the quality of environmental management; disclosure of indicators in environmental reports; the relationship between the economic and environmental components of the reporting companies in the field of sustainable development, transparency and consistency of public information about the business, which forms the business and social reputation of the company. Thus, the author's assessment of companies' environmental safety is directly related to their economic and social sustainability, is based on trends in value created, the ratio of investments allocated to environmental protection and stakeholders' paid dividends. The study made it possible to analyse the metallurgical companies' indicators representativeness according to the environmental reports, as well as to assess the level and trends of environmental safety, using the average annual rates of change in the indicators of specific emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere and specific discharges of pollutants into water bodies. The results of the study made it possible to identify both positive and negative factors affecting the environmental safety of Russian metallurgical industrial companies. Among the positive processes, it is worth mentioning an increase in social responsibility for environmental protection, investment of funds in environmental projects, an increase in information transparency of environmental reports, participation in corporate social responsibility ratings. A key indicator of positive trends is an increase in the level of environmental safety over the period from 2016 to 2019. The negative factors are the decline in investment activity of the largest companies and the growing aggressive dividend policy of the owners, which leads to strategic risks of investing in energy-saving and resource-saving technologies and industrial safety. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

TI  - Estimation Of The Value Of Forest Ecosystem Services In Pudacuo National Park, China
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in maintaining the stability of the biosphere and improving the ecological environment. The valuation of forest ecosystem services provides data to support the implementation of forest ecosystem conservation and the development of ecological-compensation standards. We used multiple sources of data, such as remote-sensing and ground data, and we employed the methods of substitute market, shadow project, and contingent valuation. We valued the forest ecosystem services of Pudacuo National Park in Shangri-La, China, which consisted of six functions: soil conservation, forest nutrient retention, water conservation, carbon fixation and oxygen released, forest health care, and atmospheric environmental purification. The results showed that: the value of forest ecological services in Pudacuo National Park was 4.49 x 10(9) yuan center dot a(-1), with higher values of carbon fixation and oxygen released, water conservation, and forest health care, in the following order: carbon fixation and oxygen released (3.85 x 10(9) yuan center dot a(-1)), water conservation (3.40 x 10(8) yuan center dot a(-1)), forest health care (1.44 x 10(8) yuan center dot a(-1)), soil conservation (1.15 x 10(8) yuan center dot a(-1)), forest nutrient retention (3.29 x 10(7) yuan center dot a(-1)), and atmosphere environmental purification (1.17 x 10(7) yuan center dot a(-1)). In addition, the value of services per stand and unit area is discussed, and the results of the study will inform the government's ecological-compensation criteria in high-quality environmental areas.

TI  - Recent Advances In Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Forest Remote Sensing—A Systematic Review. Part Ii: Research Applications
JO  - Forests
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest sustainable management aims to maintain the income of woody goods for companies, together with preserving non-productive functions as a benefit for the community. Due to the progress in platforms and sensors and the opening of the dedicated market, unmanned aerial vehicle–remote sensing (UAV–RS) is improving its key role in the forestry sector as a tool for sustainable management. The use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in precision forestry has exponentially increased in recent years, as demonstrated by more than 600 references published from 2018 until mid-2020 that were found in the Web of Science database by searching for “UAV” + “forest”. This result is even more surprising when compared with similar research for “UAV” + “agriculture”, from which emerge about 470 references. This shows how UAV–RS research forestry is gaining increasing popularity. In Part II of this review, analyzing the main findings of the reviewed papers (227), numerous strengths emerge concerning research technical issues. UAV–RS is fully applicated for obtaining accurate information from practical parameters (height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and biomass). Research effectiveness and soundness demonstrate that UAV–RS is now ready to be applied in a real management context. Some critical issues and barriers in transferring research products are also evident, namely, (1) hyperspectral sensors are poorly used, and their novel applications should be based on the capability of acquiring tree spectral signature especially for pest and diseases detection, (2) automatic processes for image analysis are poorly flexible or based on proprietary software at the expense of flexible and open-source tools that can foster researcher activities and support technology transfer among all forestry stakeholders, and (3) a clear lack exist in sensors and platforms interoperability for large-scale applications and for enabling data interoperability. © 2021 by the authors.

PY  - 2020
AB  - The sustainability of agricultural sector involves a wise water resources management and therefore an accurate spatiotemporal vegetation monitoring with relevant tools such as satellite-derived indices (VI). In this study we evaluate the performance of NDVI and NDWI indices to infer the annual crops' (mainly wheat and faba-bean) aboveground biomass(AGB)at a Mediterranean watershed. The temporal evolution of IV over the annual crops' area shows the presence of low-density and low water content vegetation in early and late season. Areas with well-developed canopy and high plant water content are dominant in the mid-season. The observed AGB of wheat and faba-bean shows a good correlation with NDVI and NDWI values (R2 > 0.71). The used vegetation indices represent a practical tool to determine the spatiotemporal variation of annual crops' AGB in Lebna watershed, however, a large dataset for validation is needed. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Species Distribution Modeling In Forest Planning Of Annual Production Units In The Southwest Amazonia
JO  - Revista Arvore
PY  - 2021
AB  - The generally limited resources for forest management and the growing need of forest production regulation requires the optimization of planning approaches for the spatialization of annual production units (APU). An APU planning methodology for forest species of high wood value (Amburana acreana (Ducke) ACSm., Apuleia leiocarpa (Vogel) JF Macbr. and Castilla ulei Warb.) in management area was proposed, using prediction of potential distribution of these species with data from the occurrence of a census forest inventory. It was used sample inventory data simulated in three sampling systems (random, conglomerate systematic, and systematic) and sample intensities (0.5% and 0.8%). As predictive variables, it was used the altitude, vertical distance to the nearest drain, individual bands of the TM sensor on board the Landsat 5, and vegetation index by normalized difference. Eighteen models were obtained, six per species. The test area under the curve (AUC) of the models ranged from 0.517 to 0.804. For all species, the best predictive model was considered the conglomerate system with a sample intensity of 0.8%. Altitude was the predictor variable that most contributed to the models. The AUC values for the Amburana acreana models were significantly different from Apuleia leiocarpa and Castilla ulei (p = 0.0138). For species of lower density, it is recommended greater sampling intensity and sampling systems that provide better spatialization of occurrence records. The use of data from sampling forest inventories in different sampling systems is capable of predicting environmental suitability for forest species and helps to define APUs. Thus, it is possible to strenghten the exploration strategies and management planning of management areas and to contribute to the perpetuation of the activity in the unequal forests of the Amazon region. © 2021, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

PY  - 2013
AB  - In recent years, the climate change which has a direct impact on the habitat of the species has been observed all over the world. So, countries' protected area management agencies have been conducting the response strategies and the relate programs about it. In this study, the yearly mean vegetation changes from 1999 to 2011 were analyzed in Korea national park areas representing very high ecological values, using SPOT-VGT NDVI S10 time series. The S10 data which were synthesized by the 10-days period were composited by monthly units based on MVC method, and were combined into yearly mean NDVI images. The 13 years' yearly mean NDVIs were converted into Greenness Rate of Change (GRC) images and Coefficient of Variation (CV) images, and these images were used to calculate statistics of annual average NDVI changes in national park areas. The statistical results showed that the vegetation changes in Korean national park region were slightly increased, and the changing levels were 2-5% based on the coefficient of variation. In other to observe the seasonal NDVI fluctuations, the monthly NDVI trend analysis will be performed in the next research. The final results of this study are expected to help establishing the satellite monitoring system for biological conservation within national parks.

TI  - Validation Of A Globally-Applicable Method To Measure Urban Tolerance Of Birds Using Citizen Science Data
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding species-specific responses to urbanization is essential to mitigate and preserve biodiversity in the face of increasing urbanization, but a major challenge is how to estimate urban tolerances for a wide array of species applicable over disparate regions. A promising approach is to assess urban tolerance by integrating geo-referenced information on species detections from citizen science data with estimations of urbanization intensity based on remotely-sensed night-time lights. While such citizen science urbanness scores (CSUS) are cost-effective, intuitive, and easily-repeatable anywhere in the world, whether the scores accurately describe urban tolerance still awaits empirical verification. By analysing >900 bird species worldwide, we find that CSUS correlates well with a standard measure of urban tolerance based on changes in abundance between urbanized and non-urbanized nearby habitats. Our analyses show that there is substantial variability in the relationship between these two metrics, but nevertheless highlights the potential for the CSUS approach in the future. Future improvements to the index, including incorporating rare species, and understanding the influence of intra-specific variability in response to urbanization, will be necessary to maximize the broad utility of the approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Landscape Units Identification By Means Of Tm Data
JO  - Digest - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 1990
AB  - Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper scenes of the Tuscan coast (central Italy) have been processed to transform their textural information into spectral information. A maximum-likelihood classifier trained on some control points has been used to discriminate between units expressing a defined significance under environmental, agricultural, and economical points of view. The use of a variance filter to extract the textural information from the original images gave good results; not only were the major structural features identified, but also slight variations in all the reflective bands related to differences in land cover types were detected. A low-pass filter based on a logarithmic algorithm allowed the construction of images with gray values which varied slowly in the spatial domain but were highly informative under a spectral point of view. As a result, the five types of landscape units were quite distinguishable on the basis of these images, and the discrimination process performed very well. The global discrimination precision is 89%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.85.

TI  - Multiscalar Approach To Mapping Marginal Agricultural Land: Smallholder Agriculture In Malawi
JO  - Annals of the American Association of Geographers
PY  - 2018
AB  - Marginal agricultural lands are defined here by suboptimal biophysical conditions and historically variable or low agricultural production. We characterize these areas using remotely sensed information to disentangle the biophysical and possible social factors driving marginality. Considering both the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy problem, the heuristic we propose is generalizable across geographies and scales and provides information at multiple decision-making levels through a multiscalar interannual variability model. We present results from our study of Malawi, where the landscape is densely cultivated and smallholder farmers frequently occupy marginal lands, to illustrate the potential of a multiscalar analysis in a place where food insecurity alleviation is needed and where remote sensing can provide necessary information. Our framework for identifying marginal agricultural lands consists of (1) locating long-term agricultural land, (2) measuring interannual productivity of long-term farmed locations, and (3) assessing marginal biophysical land characteristics and the fundamental climate niche for the dominant crop (in this case maize). Productivity and marginality in Malawi are spatially organized, and an assessment of productivity at multiple scales highlights the importance of presenting both global and local spatiotemporal variability for managing agroecological variance. By disaggregating broad classes of historically marginal production and the underlying drivers of marginality, different intervention efforts can intelligently target areas most likely to receive maximum benefit. These methodologies can be applied by both policymakers and scholars to identify and target marginal agricultural areas for improved productivity and for the support of smallholder farmer livelihoods. © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Based Approach To Forecast Habitat Quality Under Climate Change Scenarios
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2017
AB  - As climate change is expected to have a significant impact on species distributions, there is an urgent challenge to provide reliable information to guide conservation biodiversity policies. In addressing this challenge, we propose a remote sensing-based approach to forecast the future habitat quality for European badger, a species not abundant and at risk of local extinction in the arid environments of southeastern Spain, by incorporating environmental variables related with the ecosystem functioning and correlated with climate and land use. Using ensemble prediction methods, we designed global spatial distribution models for the distribution range of badger using presence-only data and climate variables. Then, we constructed regional models for an arid region in the southeast Spain using EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) derived variables and weighting the pseudo-absences with the global model projections applied to this region. Finally, we forecast the badger potential spatial distribution in the time period 2071-2099 based on IPCC scenarios incorporating the uncertainty derived from the predicted values of EVI-derived variables. By including remotely sensed descriptors of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of ecosystem functioning into spatial distribution models, results suggest that future forecast is less favorable for European badgers than not including them. In addition, change in spatial pattern of habitat suitability may become higher than when forecasts are based just on climate variables. Since the validity of future forecast only based on climate variables is currently questioned, conservation policies supported by such information could have a biased vision and overestimate or underestimate the potential changes in species distribution derived from climate change. The incorporation of ecosystem functional attributes derived from remote sensing in the modeling of future forecast may contribute to the improvement of the detection of ecological responses under climate change scenarios. © 2017 Requena-Mullor et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

TI  - Estimation Of Shrub Willow Biophysical Parameters Across Time And Space From Sentinel-2 And Unmanned Aerial System (Uas) Data
JO  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - Shrub willow can be used as a perennial energy crop to produce biomass for biofuels, bioproducts, and bioenergy to help address environmental issues. Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy chlo-rophyll content (CCC), which are closely related to vegetation health status, provide valuable information to assess willow vigor and crop management activities. We developed models for estimating LCC, LAI, and CCC from Sentinel-2 and unmanned aerial system (UAS) data using a number of vegetation indices (VIs) and applying four analytical tools: regression analysis, partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and neural networks (NNs). We investigated twenty VIs using regression analysis, finding the red-edge normalized differ-ence vegetation index (NDVIre) as the optimal VI based on predictive performance and so this was included as an input variable for the PLSR, RF, and NN methods. For RF and NN models, sensitivity analysis was implemented to help tune hyperparameters and provide information to guide future studies. Results showed that the best averaged performance of Sentinel-2 and UAS data for LCC, LAI, and CCC (normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 9\%, 12\%, and 10\%) of the same site in the same year was derived from models based on the NN algorithm using blue (B), green (G), red (R), red-edge (RE), and near-infrared (NIR) bands. In order to test model transferability, we collected UAS and Sentinel-2 data across different years and sites. Based on NRMSE, NN models using B, G, R, RE, and NIR bands provided the best averaged predictive performance for LCC estimation (16\%) and the regression modeling using NDVIre performed best for LAI (21\%) and CCC (13\%) estimation for both Sentinel-2 and UAS data. Moreover, CCC estimation had smaller NRMSE values than LCC and LAI esti-mation for both Sentinel-2 and UAS data. Based on this study, we found that UAS data has the potential to complement Sentinel-2 data by mitigating limitations caused by temporal resolution and cloud cover. We also recommend use of the CCC parameter to evaluate shrub willow health status and perform time-series monitoring across time and space.

TI  - Land Use Change Monitoring On The Process Of Urbanization In The Central Plains Economic Zone Based On Remote Sensing And Gis Technologies
PY  - 2013
AB  - Analysis of land use change for urban sprawl is of great value for the management of urban and rural planning and regional sustainable development. In this study, an important city of the Central Plains Economic Zone -Luoyang City was used as an example to explore the land use monitoring framework for the process of urbanization based on remote sensing and GIS technologies. At first, suitable classification systems of urban land information for the Central Plains Economic Zone was discussed. Then thematic maps of land use change in Luoyang City were extracted through the combination of computer automatic classification methods and visual interpretation. Finally, land use change due to urbanization in Luoyang City from 2006 to 2009 was analyzed. The results show that: the speed of urbanization of Luoyang City in the period 2006-2009 accelerated significantly. For example construction land area increased from 91350ha to 104193ha from 2006 to 2009, with a total change area of 12843ha and increased rate of 4281ha per year. The rate of construction land change increased by 47.11\% than that in the period 2000-2006. The high growth rate, which was even higher than that in the same period in Zhengzhou City, shows that Luoyang City was in her stage of rapid urbanization in recent years.

TI  - Satellite Rainfall Estimation From Himawari-8 Multi Channels Observation Based On Aws Data Trained Machine Learning Methods
JO  - Springer Proceedings in Physics
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rainfall estimation from geostationary satellites has the advantage of its relatively high temporal resolution. Therefore, the data can be used for supporting the early warning systems of hydrometeorological disasters. This study implemented machine learning methods to estimate rainfall using the multi-channels data from the Himawari-8 satellite at several locations in Indonesia, i.e., Bandung (West Java), Pasuruan (East Java), and Agam (West Sumatera). The ground-based rainfall measurements taken from installed Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) at the three sites were involved in providing reference values and labels of data training. The brightness temperature (BT) of 9 infrared channels of Himawari-8 and 36 combinations of their brightness temperature differences (BTD) were used as explanatory variables. We introduced the three steps of machine learning procedures: (i) separation of rain and no-rain event; (ii) classification of rainfall category; and (iii) estimation of rainfall rate. Generally, machine learning methods used in this study for rainfall retrieval are applicable for site-scale with acceptable accuracies. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model has had the highest accuracy (Acc = 0.75, POD = 0.75, SR = 0.76, POFD = 0.24) compared to the other 8 classifiers models for detecting rain and no-rain event (step 1) and for classifying the categorical rainfall (step 2). The selected regression models for rain rate estimation, based on the highest correlation, included the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR), the Random Forest (RF), and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Overall, we obtained a good coefficient of correlation from comparing the actual rainfall and the estimated from Himawari-8 (R2 = 0.92). However, the generalization results of these selected models to be applied for larger spatial coverage areas has not been produced consistently. The lack of AWS data sites and the relatively short data period might be the issues. From the calculation of feature importance, we found that BTD of BT9.6µ − BT13.3µ (Band12 and 16), which correlates to cloud top height, had the highest contribution for rainfall retrieval based on the LDA machine learning method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper considers the basic ingredients that can change the economics and utility of satellite communications in the first and second decade of the 21st century. Emphasis is placed on satisfying the market using technology. One of the practical results of any dynamic market is the need to plan for changes during the 10-1 5 years lifetime of a satellite. This requires careful planning as many existing satellites have outlived their original owners. The truly new satellite designs can choose from a cornucopia of technology under development during the closing years of the 20th century. The acceptance of interference from other users while creating negligible problems for others is attainable with techniques now in use or emerging from research laboratories. Modulation, compression, spectrum conservation and low costs can be achieved with a careful combination of the technologies that will be available in the next 10 to 15 years. This paper catalogs these new tools and then discusses the application of the ones considered to be the most useful. © 1995 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

TI  - Assessment Of The Eco-Environmental Quality In The Nanweng River Nature Reserve, Northeast China By Remote Sensing
JO  - Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology
PY  - 2018
AB  - Scientific and rapid assessment of the ecological environment quality based on remote sensing can provide basis for regional protection, management and planning. In this study, using Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS in 1990, 2000 and 2015 as data sources, four indices including the wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation (WET), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up and soil index (NDSI), and land surface temperature (LST) were derived, with the weights being determined by principal components analysis (PCA). Remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to evaluate the eco-environmental quality of Nanweng River Nature Reserve from 1990 to 2015. Results showed that RSEI was an effective indicator for evaluating spatio-temporal dynamics of eco-environmental quality. From 1990 to 2015, the mean value of RSEI of Nanweng River Nature Reserve increased from 0.55 to 0.83, the proportion of area with excellent and good levels of RSEI trended to increase, probably due to the increase of forests at those levels. Meanwhile, 91.4% of the total land area in the reserve had an improved eco-environmental quality. Such improvement was attributed to the establishment of the reserve and implement of a series of engineering and non-engineering protection measures. In the north of core area and buffer area, decrease of eco-environmental quality was due to forest fires which destroyed a large area of forest vegetation. In the road side and southeast of the experimental area, intensified human activities led to the decrease of regional eco-environmental quality. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Building Extraction From Uav Images Jointly Using 6d-Slic And Multiscale Siamese Convolutional Networks
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - Automatic building extraction using a single data type, either 2D remotely-sensed images or light detection and ranging 3D point clouds, remains insufficient to accurately delineate building outlines for automatic mapping, despite active research in this area and the significant progress which has been achieved in the past decade. This paper presents an effective approach to extracting buildings from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images through the incorporation of superpixel segmentation and semantic recognition. A framework for building extraction is constructed by jointly using an improved Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm and Multiscale Siamese Convolutional Networks (MSCNs). The SLIC algorithm, improved by additionally imposing a digital surface model for superpixel segmentation, namely 6D-SLIC, is suited for building boundary detection under building and image backgrounds with similar radiometric signatures. The proposed MSCNs, including a feature learning network and a binary decision network, are used to automatically learn a multiscale hierarchical feature representation and detect building objects under various complex backgrounds. In addition, a gamma-transform green leaf index is proposed to truncate vegetation superpixels for further processing to improve the robustness and efficiency of building detection, the Douglas-Peucker algorithm and iterative optimization are used to eliminate jagged details generated from small structures as a result of superpixel segmentation. In the experiments, the UAV datasets, including many buildings in urban and rural areas with irregular shapes and different heights and that are obscured by trees, are collected to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results based on the qualitative and quantitative measures confirm the effectiveness and high accuracy of the proposed framework relative to the digitized results. The proposed framework performs better than state-of-the-art building extraction methods, given its higher values of recall, precision, and intersection over Union (IoU). © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Research Progress In Supercontinuum Generation And Regulation Based On Femtosecond Laser Filamentation
JO  - Zhongguo Jiguang/Chinese Journal of Lasers
PY  - 2023
AB  - Significance Ultrafast laser propagation in transparent media can lead to long-range diffraction-free filamentation. The laser filament has numerous nonlinear optical effects such as the Kerr effect, self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing, and self-steepening. Supercontinuum covers the ultrabroad range from microwave to ultraviolet. Supercontinuum generation from femtosecond laser filaments has an ultrabroad band, high directionality, and tunability. Therefore, the supercontinuum can be used in absorption spectroscopy, remote gas detection, pulse compression, and few-cycle pulse generation. The supercontinuum is mainly induced by self-phase modulation, which considerably broadens the spectrum. The generation and regulation technology of the supercontinuum have matured gradually owing to the development of the commercial femtosecond laser. The supercontinuum is excellent broadband coherent radiation that can be extended to multiple octaves. The supercontinuum is applicable to absorption spectrum detection. The directionality of the supercontinuum benefits from the spatial directivity of the filament. Therefore, the supercontinuum can realize the remote sensing and detection. The spectrum-broadening and abundant nonlinear effects during supercontinuum generation can compensate for the dispersion to realize pulse self-compression. The conventional scheme generally undergoes two processes: spectrum broadening and pulse compression, which is inefficient and extremely limited by the compression elements for large energy pulses. The supercontinuum from the filaments provides a new way to solve this problem, simplifying the pulse compression process with great efficiency. Progress In specific application scenarios, the multi-dimensional modulation of the supercontinuum is essential for certain spectral distributions and conversion efficiency. In past decades, various schemes, including spatial shaping, pulse shaping, polarization modulation, focusing conditions modulation, and material modulation, were developed. Spatial shaping can directly adjust the spatial energy distribution of the input laser pulse. Supercontinuum conversion efficiency can be considerably improved by multiple filament generation, which overcomes the energy saturation effect compared to a single filament. Pulse shaping modulates the time-domain profiles of the laser pulse, which is useful for obtaining specific band supercontinuum generation. The polarization state of the laser field affects the nonlinear polarization process of the nonlinear medium, thereby changing the spectral range, spectral intensity, and polarization state of supercontinuum radiation. The focusing condition or physical properties and arrangement of the transmission medium are direct and convenient methods for controlling supercontinuum generation by changing the length and intensity of the filament.Recently, the supercontinuum has been widely studied and important progress has been achieved. The modulation schemes are summarized in Section 3. Researchers proposed the control of the energy distribution of the filament through beam spatial shaping to optimize the femtosecond laser filamentation and generation of a supercontinuum (Figs. 2-6). The time-domain characteristics of the femtosecond laser, such as pulse width, chirp, and initial spectrum, can directly affect the filament supercontinuum. Pulse shape regulation has important applications in the research of femtosecond laser filamentation and optimization of the supercontinuum (Figs. 7 and 8). Because the nonlinear coefficient, plasma density, and clamping light intensity are related to the ellipticity of the driving laser, incident laser polarization is also used for regulating the filament supercontinuum (Figs. 9 - 11). Additionally, it is demonstrated that the effective regulation of the supercontinuum in femtosecond laser filamentation can be achieved by controlling the focusing conditions and material (Figs. 12 - 14). This review focuses on physical mechanisms and modulation methods, and systematically summarizes the l test progress in the supercontinuum based on femtosecond laser filaments. Conclusions and Prospects In summary, with the development of ultrafast laser technology and nonlinear optics, the physical mechanism of supercontinuum generation has been gradually clarified. Relevant experiments have been extended from solid and liquid to gas and applied to remote gas detection and sensing. This review summarizes the physical mechanism and multi-dimensional regulation scheme of filament-induced supercontinuum and briefly introduces the application scenarios of the supercontinuum, including transient absorption spectrum systems, remote sensing systems, and the seed of the mid-infrared and air lasers. At present, most of the experiments and simulations of the supercontinuum are limited to the laboratory; complex environmental conditions, such as turbulence, temperature, and humidity changes, should be considered in remote sensing. In addition, although the supercontinuum can also provide a direct seed source for an air laser, it must be optimized further and the generation distance, wavelength, and energy conversion efficiency of future air lasers must be controlled. In addition, the backscattering mechanism and spatial distribution of air lasers must be studied to develop related applications. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Characters Of Teaching Physical Qigong In Coastal Area Based On Geological Management Information System
JO  - Arabian Journal of Geosciences
PY  - 2021
AB  - China has a long tradition of sports and fitness Qigong, which is a wealth of Chinese sport culture. Today, people pay more and more attention to their own health, while bearing in mind that exercise and health care are common not only among middle-aged and elderly people but also among young people, particularly young college students. Fitness Qigong, as a type of exercise that can take into account both health and exercise, has improved the physical quality of college students and enhanced the content of campus courses. Teenagers also spread traditional Chinese culture while practicing Qigong. The topic of physical education itself is very unique and needs to be balanced with the field environment. In coastal areas, Qigong sports have a certain demand, so it is important to set up Qigong sport courses in coastal city colleges and universities. According to data from the tourism department, we can see that there is a wide market for Qigong sports in China, so it has a great potential for growth. In order to further the teaching of Qigong sports and to encourage the growth of sports in coastal areas, we should make full use of good resources in coastal areas. Centered on the study of the geological environment and the development requirements of different coastal areas and towns, this paper assesses the rationality of Qigong sport teaching in different areas. This is conducive to enriching the campus’ cultural activities so that students build a fitness habit so that students who are involved in Qigong fitness can, at the same time, make students aware of lifelong physical activity so that Qigong fitness can have a stronger fitness value. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

The benefits of such capabilities are shown, in terms of both costs and user-friendliness, through actual cases which ASI is currently carrying on in international cooperation programs such as ORFEO (Optical and Radar Federation for Earth Observation) with French Government, and SIASGE (Italian- Argentinean Satellite System for Emergency Management) with Argentinean Government. This paper intends to delineate those fundamental characteristics of COSMO-SkyMed that constitute an asset for all applications, through first-class observation capabilities, state of art technology, and services capable to obtain, process and exploit radar observations, integrated with other sensors, aimed at improving security levels, citizen security and life quality. © 2006 by Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (Italian Space Agency).

TI  - Triangular Factorization-Based Simplex Algorithms For Hyperspectral Unmixing
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2012
AB  - In the linear unmixing of hyperspectral images, the observation pixels form a simplex whose vertices correspond to the endmembers, hence finding the endmembers is equivalent to extracting these vertices. A common technique for determining vertices is to analyze the simplex volume, but it usually has a high computational complexity, resulting from the exhaustive searching of volume in the large hyperspectral data. This problem limits the practicability and real-time application. In this paper, we utilize triangular factorization (TF) to calculate the volume, deducing a method named simplex volume analysis based on TF (SVATF). It requires just one comparison through the data to succeed in finding the global optimal solution for all the endmembers, thus improving the searching efficiency. Dimensionality reduction transformation is not necessary, which is another advantage of this method. Moreover, since TF is a broad conception including different methods, SVATF is a framework including various implementations. Based on TF, we also propose a fast learning algorithm named abundance quantification based on TF to estimate the abundances, which further saves the computation by utilizing the intermediate values involved in SVATF. The abundance estimation method can rectify possible errors in the given endmembers by utilizing two important constraints (abundance nonnegative constraint and abundance sum-to-one constraint) of the linear mixture model, so it is useful for the imagery without pure pixels. Experimental results on synthetic and real hyperspectral data demonstrate that the proposed methods can obtain accurate results with much lower computational complexity, with respect to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Cost–Benefit Evaluation Of Walnut And Jujube Orchards Under Fruit Tree–Crop Intercropping Conditions In Southern Xinjiang
JO  - Forests
PY  - 2023
AB  - Fruit planting plays an essential role in achieving zero hunger, ensuring food security, and increasing the income of local people. As one of China’s principal fruit-planting areas, southern Xinjiang possesses more than 80% of the total fruit-planting areas of Xinjiang. However, the spatial distribution, extent, and types of fruit trees remain unknown, generating uncertainty in calculating the economic benefits of orchards in this area. In this paper, we used walnut and jujube orchards under fruit tree–crop intercropping conditions in the Hotan Oasis in southern Xinjiang as the research object. Walnut and jujube orchards were precisely characterized using object-oriented and decision tree classification methods. Then, the economic benefits for farmers were estimated based on field surveys and statistical data. From 2003 to 2020, the area of jujube orchards rapidly increased from 1.91 × 103 ha to 33.59 × 103 ha, while that of walnut orchards steadily increased from 18.05 × 103 ha to 40.24 × 103 ha. The expansion areas of walnut orchards were mainly transformed from other orchards in the oasis, while the expansion areas of jujube orchards mainly originated from newly cultivated land in the desert. The increases in areas and yields largely offset the increase in planting costs and the decrease in purchase prices, resulting in an increasing trend in the total net income of the orchards. From 2003 to 2020, the total net income of walnut orchards increased by 68.96%, and the total net income of jujube orchards significantly increased by 23.37 times. However, the output/input ratios of walnut orchards under intercropping conditions were approximately two times higher than those of jujube orchards under monocropping conditions. The increase in investment slightly offset the decreases in yields and purchase prices, resulting in increases of 5.24% and 18.64% in the output/input ratios of walnuts and jujubes, respectively, in orchards exhibiting standardized cultivation. In the future, it is necessary to significantly expand the area of orchards involving standardized cultivation and improve the yield and quality of fruits, thereby increasing the yields and income levels of local farmers. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Towards A Collaborative Global Land Cover Information Service
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
PY  - 2017
AB  - The need and critical importance of global land cover and change information has been well recognized. Although rich collection of such information has been made available, the lack of necessary information services to support its easy access, analysis and validation makes it difficult to find, evaluate, select and reuse them through well-designed workflows. Aiming at promoting the development of the needed global land cover information services, this paper presents a conceptual framework for developing a Collaborative Global Land Cover Information Service (CoGland), followed by discussions on its implementation strategies. The framework supports connected and shared land cover and change web services around the world to address resource sharing, community service and cross-board collaboration needs. CoGland can benefit several recent international initiatives such as Future Earth, and many societal benefit areas. The paper further proposes that CoGland be developed within the framework of the Group on Earth Observations with the support of a number of key organizations such as the United Nations Expert Committee on Global Geospatial Information Management, the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, and International Society of Digital Earth. It is hoped that this paper can serve as a starting point for further discussions on CoGland developments.

TI  - Costs Of F-18-Fdg Pet: Experience With A Satellite Concept
JO  - NuklearMedizin
PY  - 1998
AB  - Aim: One of the main arguments against the acceptance and introduction of FDG PET as a regular benefit in the statutory Medical Insurance system in Germany are its (alleged) high costs. The aim of the present study has been to determine empirically over a period of twelve months the costs of FDG PET, making use of a satellite concept. Methods: Documentation on performance and consumption data has been assembled for purposes of cost analysis. After analysis these data provided the basis for an assessment of the costs. In view of the high proportion of fixed overheads and strong fluctuations in consumption values, it was not possible to allocate reliably in an individual FDG PET investigation the various types of costs to individual causes. A monthly cost assessment procedure was therefore adopted. For this purpose data were recorded in the department for Nuclear Medicine, while the statistical assessment of the consumption data and analysis of the costs were undertaken in the Institute of industrial and Hospital Management. Results: Over the twelve month observation period (November 1995 to October 1996, 177 working days) 433 patients were included in the study: 244 with brain diseases 37 cardiac patients, 130 whole body studies and 22 combined studies (brain and whole body scans). The non volume based costs, maintenance charges and depreciation accounted for the highest proportion of the total costs (48%). The FDG-related costs accounted for 41% of the total costs, while the personnel costs amounted to 11% and the film costs to only 0.45%. The total costs incurred amounted to DM 1,205,050. Conclusion: These data represent a first empirical cost analysis for FDG PET based on a satellite concept and form a starting point for a cost/benefit analysis of this procedure.

TI  - Integrating Field And Satellite Data For Spatially Explicit Inference On The Density Of Threatened Arboreal Primates
JO  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
PY  - 2017
AB  - Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.

TI  - Green Infrastructure Indicators For Urban Planning: Applying The Integrated Approach For Russian Largest Cities
JO  - Geography, Environment, Sustainability
PY  - 2020
AB  - Modern approaches to urban planning assume the dualistic nature of urban green infrastructure (GI). On the one hand, green infrastructure is as an integrated network of natural and semi-natural areas, featuring a delivery of various benefits to humans. On the other hand, GI is multifunctional and provides the residents by complex of ecosystem services to be user-oriented. Most official reports and programs use common indicators that do not characterize distribution, dynamics or state of GI. In our research, we assessed the quality of GI in 15 largest Russian cities by using an integrated assessment of 13 indicators that make up three groups: the ones 1) characterizing general GI availability; 2) supporting a comfortable urban environment («recreational indicators»); and 3) forming a stable ecosystem («integrity indicators»). The cities were ranked by values of every indicator from 1 to 15 and then the results were summed and normalized to get a total mark (max. 100). To assess the development of GI elements of each group, we also ranked cities separately by values of different groups indicators. Thus, our study revealed that satisfactory marks for both recreational and integrity indicators have Ufa, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Ekaterinburg, Perm and Voronezh. In contrast, Saint Petersburg, being a densely built-up city in an auspicious natural zone, got the worst result. According to the final assessment, the quality of green infrastructure in Krasnoyarsk, a large industrial city, and four cities from the steppe zone (Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Omsk, Novosibirsk) is also unsatisfactory. Our method does not cover all GI aspects (like vegetation health) and since it is based solely on remote sensing data and statistics data, there is definitely a room for improvement. However, this method, while being relatively quick and simple to accomplish, allows to assess not only general availability of GI, but its quality and distribution as well, which are essential for urban spatial planning. © 2020, Russian Geographical Society.

TI  - Wavelet-Anfis Hybrid Model For Modis Ndvi Prediction
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization at the expense of the natural environment has been increasing in Turkey in recent years. The toll it takes on the ecosystem has an adverse impact on local weather systems and natural resources. These rapid ecosystem changes are mostly observed in the western parts of Turkey. For a reliable prediction of sustainable development planning, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used as the main index for the description of both urbanization and land class. This study proposes the optimum adaptive neural-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and hybrid Wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS) models to estimate NDVI variation for certain seasonal (summer and winter) data in a grid area of 20 x 20 km(2) centered at the Kandilli region of Istanbul, Turkey (28 degrees 57' 53 '' E and 41 degrees 01' 07 '' N). The calculated NDVI values were obtained using the WANFIS model and compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Observations. The results reveal that the mean absolute percentage error of NDVI values are calculated as 1.5\% and 0.7\% for the winter and summer test datasets, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of the winter and summer test datasets are 0.977 and 0.991, respectively. Further, when compared with ANFIS, the results demonstrate that the WANFIS model exhibits a better approximation for the estimation of NDVI variation in the summer than in the winter.

TI  - Improving Imbalanced Land Cover Classification With K-Means Smote: Detecting And Oversampling Distinctive Minority Spectral Signatures
JO  - INFORMATION
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land cover maps are a critical tool to support informed policy development, planning, and resource management decisions. With significant upsides, the automatic production of Land Use/Land Cover maps has been a topic of interest for the remote sensing community for several years, but it is still fraught with technical challenges. One such challenge is the imbalanced nature of most remotely sensed data. The asymmetric class distribution impacts negatively the performance of classifiers and adds a new source of error to the production of these maps. In this paper, we address the imbalanced learning problem, by using K-means and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) as an improved oversampling algorithm. K-means SMOTE improves the quality of newly created artificial data by addressing both the between-class imbalance, as traditional oversamplers do, but also the within-class imbalance, avoiding the generation of noisy data while effectively overcoming data imbalance. The performance of K-means SMOTE is compared to three popular oversampling methods (Random Oversampling, SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE) using seven remote sensing benchmark datasets, three classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Classifier) and three evaluation metrics using a five-fold cross-validation approach with three different initialization seeds. The statistical analysis of the results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the remaining oversamplers producing higher quality land cover classifications. These results suggest that LULC data can benefit significantly from the use of more sophisticated oversamplers as spectral signatures for the same class can vary according to geographical distribution.

TI  - The Effects Of Forest Composition And Management On Evapotranspiration In The New Jersey Pinelands
JO  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Forests deliver contrasting ecosystem services in relation to water, both provisioning it through filtration and recharge, and consuming it through evapotranspiration. Understanding forest evapotranspiration is critical for landscapes managed in part for the social benefits of their water provisioning ecosystem services. We used the flux disaggregation algorithm for the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse model (DisALEXI) with remotely sensed data to characterize landscape-scale evapotranspiration at 30-m spatial resolution over the forested coastal plain Pinelands of southern New Jersey, USA. We examined changes in evapotranspiration due to forest compositional and cover differences, then evaluated the effects of three common management actions (thinning, seed tree regeneration, and prescribed burning) on stand evapotranspiration. Among various forest compositions, upland oak forests had the lowest annual evapotranspiration, while Atlantic white cedar had the highest. In uplands, increasing proportions of conifers increased evapotranspiration, as did increased canopy cover in conifer stands. Seed tree harvests reduced evapotranspiration for about 13 years, while thinning reduced forest water use for approximately six years. Prescribed fires had variable effects, but their typical application did not reduce evapotranspiration for a complete growing season. Our research can help to inform models and decisionmaking around forests and landscape water yield.

TI  - A System For Multi-Domain Contextualization Of Personal Health Data
JO  - Journal of Medical Systems
PY  - 2017
AB  - Current telehealth systems are used to improve the treatment of chronic diseases by collecting medical data at the patient and transferring them to a remote medical institution. Research shows that such medical practice can be substantially improved if the measured parameters are greater in number and of more diverse nature. Emerging consumer solutions for monitoring personal health and wellness, as well as various resources from domains like internet, telecommunications and smart living, can be used as possible sources for exploration of an individual’s wider health context. It was our aim to design an internet of things solutions, which would combine these sources of information into context information, complementary to health data. An internet of things platform was designed and implemented and integration with an established e-health system was provided to enrich telehealth data with context information by aggregating and processing cross-domain inputs from various sources. The approach was validated on a use case scenario. The concept was tried in a scenario related to prevention and management of heart disease. The system’s advanced graphic correlation features are expected to help physicians and patients identify true roots of health problems. Medical researchers are also expected to benefit from a deeper insight into complex cross-domain parameter dependencies that determine an individual’s health. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Improving the environment of cities by optimized and green space brings great ecological and social benefits. Urban green space (UGS) is an indispensable component of urban environmental systems and is important to urban residents. In this study, applying remote sensing simulation, green space is explored. A novel methodological framework for integrating these two different data sources to conduct the social functional mapping of UGS has been required. It indicates that Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a powerful and significant predictor to explain variation in runoff. The important role of urban green spaces in attenuating local flooding and may provide planners and decision-makers with a method to consider. Finally, the strategy is proved by simulation and provides hints for future planning of urban green spaces.

JO  - Modeling Earth Systems and Environment
PY  - 2020
AB  - Spatial demand will increase when the population growth in an area. For sufficient space will occupy the surrounding land (periphery). This condition is known as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl is a complex phenomenon, as it affects social life and becomes a serious environmental problem. Environmental problems that occur because of the change in the land function of agriculture and forests into residential areas and commercial purposes. This study aims to conduct trend analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban/built-up areas during the periods 1990–2016. Integration of remote sensing, GIS, and Shannon’s entropy statistical approach was used to obtain information regarding dynamics change in the areas. The results of the trend entropy value analysis show that urban/built-up development is tending to spread, with increases in entropy values based on the region’s urban/built-up sub-watershed areas during the 1990–2016 periods of 1.464 and 1.597, respectively. Meanwhile, based on the radial distance from Bandung city, these are 1.511 and 1.737, respectively. The results of the relative entropy are equal to 0.151 in 1990, with an increase to 0.156 in 2016, based on the region’s urban/built-up area of the sub-watershed. Meanwhile, based on the radial distance from Bandung city, the values were 0.156 in 1990 and 0.170 in 2016. This study can be used as important benchmarks for planners, policymakers, and researchers regarding spatial planning in the study area. The results could also provide important inputs for sustainable land use plans and strategies to reduce disasters and flood hazards, as well as flood disaster vulnerability analysis of residential areas. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Global Cost Of Land Degradation
JO  - Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement - A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development
PY  - 2015
AB  - Land degradation—defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report as the long-term loss of ecosystems services—is a global problem, negatively affecting the livelihoods and food security of billions of people. Intensifying efforts, mobilizing more investments and strengthening the policy commitment for addressing land degradation at the global level needs to be supported by a careful evaluation of the costs and benefits of action versus costs of inaction against land degradation. Consistent with the definition of land degradation, we adopt the Total Economic Value (TEV) approach to determine the costs of land degradation and use remote sensing data and global statistical databases in our analysis. The results show that the annual costs of land degradation due to land use and land cover change (LUCC) are about US$231 billion per year or about 0.41 % of the global GDP of US$56.49 trillion in 2007. Contrary to past global land degradation assessment studies, land degradation is severe in both tropical and temperate countries. However, the losses from LUCC are especially high in Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 26 % of the total global costs of land degradation due to LUCC. However, the local tangible losses (mainly provisioning services) account only for 46 % of the total cost of land degradation and the rest of the cost is due to the losses of ecosystem services (ES) accruable largely to beneficiaries other than the local land users. These external ES losses include carbon sequestration, biodiversity, genetic information and cultural services. This implies that the global community bears the largest cost of land degradation, which suggests that efforts to address land degradation should be done bearing in mind that the global community, as a whole, incurs larger losses than the local communities experiencing land degradation. The cost of soil fertility mining due to using land degrading management practices on maize, rice and wheat is estimated to be about US$15 billion per year or 0.07 % of the global GDP. Though these results are based on a crop simulation approach that underestimates the impact of land degradation and covers only three crops, they reveal the high cost of land degradation for the production of the major food crops of the world. Our simulations also show that returns to investment in action against land degradation are twice larger than the cost of inaction in the first six years alone. Moreover, when one takes a 30-year planning horizon, the returns are five dollars per each dollar invested in action against land degradation. The opportunity cost accounts for the largest share of the cost of action against land degradation. This explains why land users, often basing their decisions in very short-time horizons, could degrade their lands even when they are aware of bigger longer-term losses that are incurred in the process. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - Spatial Food-Web Structure In The Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean Based On Compound- Specific Nitrogen Isotope Analysis Of Amino Acids
JO  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
PY  - 2017
AB  - The effective evaluation of trophic interactions in pelagic food webs is essential for understanding food web ecology, conservation biology, and management. We tested the applicability of compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) for (1) characterizing trophic positions (TPs) of nine species from four trophic groups (tunas, squids, myctophids, and euphausiids) within a pelagic food web in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) Ocean, (2) evaluating trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) of each trophic group, and (3) detecting spatial changes in TPs and food chain length across a region with heterogeneous productivity. Although delta N-15 values of bulk tissues generally increased from south-to-north, CSIA-AA revealed that trophic positions were uniform throughout our study area. These results suggest that variability in delta N-15 values were largely driven by nitrogen cycling dynamics in the ETP, which highlights the importance of these processes for the interpretation of delta N-15 values in food web studies. Absolute TP estimates were unrealistic for higherlevel species, and TDFs (tunas: 4.0 parts per thousand, squids: 4.6 parts per thousand, myctophids: 5.0 parts per thousand, and euphausiids: 7.0 parts per thousand) were lower than a widely used ecosystem TDF. We used remotely sensed oceanographic data to evaluate the physical oceanography and biological productivity throughout our study area and found significant relationships between delta N-15 values, nitrate concentrations, and SST across our study area. We did not find a gradient in phytoplankton cell size co-occurring with an expected productivity gradient across our sampling region, which substantiated our isotope results indicating non-significant spatial changes in TP and food chain length across the ETP.

TI  - Predicting Environmental Suitability And Geographical Distribution Of Dicrocoelium Dendriticum At Littoral Of Caspian Sea: An Ecological Niche-Based Modeling
JO  - Preventive Veterinary Medicine
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dicrocoeliasisis caused by the small liver fluke (Dicrocoelium spp.), mainly Dicrocoelium dendriticum in domestic and wild ruminants. The small liver fluke is the probable predisposing cause of economic burden. The impact of geographic and climatic factors on the incidence of dicrocoeliasis has been severely ignored in different geographical areas. Due to the lack of data regarding dicrocoeliasis in Iran, this study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and intensity of ovine and bovine Dicrocoelium infection in the coastal strip south of the Caspian Sea. Fecal samples were obtained from the cattle and sheep in three provinces of Guilan, Mazandaran and Golestan at the littoral of the Caspian Sea. All collected samples were then tested by flotation methods for determining the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG). Moreover, we applied maximum entropy niche-based modeling (MaxEnt), coupled with remote sensing and the Geographical Information System (GIS) to visualize the spatial distribution and risk factors of Dicrocoelium dendriticum at the littoral of Caspian Sea. A total of 2688 stool samples were collected from cattle (n = 1344) and sheep (n = 1344) in coastal provinces of the Caspian Sea including Guilan (n = 1280), Mazandaran (n = 768) and Golestan (n = 640) provinces. Based on the data presented here, the highest rate of infection was observed in Guilan and Mazandaran provinces. The results revealed the prevalence rates of 36.72% and 6.09% for sheep and cattle in Guilan province, respectively. This rate was 22.4% for sheep and 3.91% for cattle in Mazandaran province. However, the rate of sheep infection was 90% in some point locations. Dicrocoelium infection was found to be significantly different between three provinces in sheep (P < 0.00001, Chi = 111.633). Our findings exhibited a high reliability of the MaxEnt model, and area under the curve (AUC) values of the training and test data sets were determined to be 0.852 and 0.818, respectively. Jackknife analysis showed the relative variable contribution to the model performance, where four variables were found as key influential factors that highly affected the habitat suitability of the presence of the lancet fluke including the precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17), altitude, temperature seasonality (Bio4), and precipitation of driest month (Bio14). The findings of this study demonstrated a high presence rate of Dicrocoelium infection at the littoral of Caspian Sea, Iran. Moreover, climatic variables can be considered as important predictive factors affecting the distribution of infection in the studied areas. Further studies based on the findings of the GIS are also very important in the country for planning control programs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Matrix Overlay For Drought Assessment
JO  - Asian Association on Remote Sensing - 27th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2006
PY  - 2006
AB  - Drought is an insidious hazard of nature. It occurs almost everywhere in all climate zones, although its features vary from region to region with time, space as well as intensity. In a country like Thailand where almost agricultural land is rain-fed. It is a constant threat in one or another part of country especially in the Northeast region. The role of GIS technology can offer the ability to depict the spatial distribution of the extent and monitoring capability for natural disaster management. Matrix overlay function in ArcView GIS developed by Khon Kaen University is applied to assess the drought risk areas in the Nam Choen watershed which is in the Northeast of Thailand. Seven parameters involved in accordance to the impacts on drought are rainfall, surface water and irrigation, sub-surface water, stream density, slope, soil drainage, and finally, land use. The intensity of impact is represented by the value assigned to the entries of each matrix. The study result illustrates that 13.47 % of Nam Choen watershed are of very mild risk, 40.88 % are of mild risk, 37.87 % are of moderate risk and 7.78 % are of severe risk.

TI  - Rs \& Gis Based Assessment Of Adsorptive Non-Point Source Pollution In Eucalyptus And Rubber Plantation At The Water Source Area Of Hainan
PY  - 2009
AB  - Adsorptive non-point source pollution associated with soil erosion has brought big problems to water environment and land productivity As the most important water source area of Hainan. the Songtao Reservoir Basin (SRB) has faced with a crisis of water contamination caused by land exploitation The objectives of this study are: (1) to assess the soil erosion risk and adsorptive non-point source pollution load; (2) to put forward a scheme for land management and planning to control soil erosion and non-point source pollution Taking GIS and remote sensing as main techniques, an analysis was conducted to assess the non-point source pollution load caused by eucalyptus and rubber cultivation. Research findings indicate that soil erosion in the eucalyptus and rubber plantations is much more serious than the natural forest, and causes heavier adsorptive non-point source pollution. Adopting soil and water conservation facilities can effectively control the soil erosion and non-point source pollution which can bring a lasting ecological and economic benefit

TI  - Disturbance And Predation Risk Influence Vigilance Synchrony Of Black-Necked Cranes <I>Grus Nigricollis</I>, But Not As Strongly As Expected
JO  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2021
AB  - Animals monitor surrounding dangers independently or cooperatively (synchronized and coordinated vigilance), with independent and synchronized scanning being prevalent. Coordinated vigilance, including unique sentinel behavior, is rare in nature, since it is time-consuming and limited in terms of benefits. No evidence showed animals adopt alternative vigilance strategies during antipredation scanning yet. Considering the nonindependent nature of both synchronization and coordination, we assessed whether group members could keep alert synchronously or in a coordinated fashion under different circumstance. We studied how human behavior and species-specific variables impacted individual and collective vigilance of globally threatened black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) and explored behavior-based wildlife management. We tested both predation risk (number of juveniles in group) and human disturbance (level and distance) effects on individual and collective antipredation vigilance of black-necked crane families. Adults spent significantly more time (proportion and duration) on scanning than juveniles, and parents with juveniles behaved more vigilant. Both adults and juveniles increased time allocation and duration on vigilance with observer proximity. Deviation between observed and expected collective vigilance varied with disturbance and predation risk from zero, but not significantly so, indicating that an independent vigilance strategy was adopted by black-necked crane couples. The birds showed synchronized vigilance in low disturbance areas, with fewer juveniles and far from observers; otherwise, they scanned in coordinated fashion. The collective vigilance, from synchronized to coordinated pattern, varied as a function of observer distance that helped us determine a safe distance of 403.75 m for the most vulnerable family groups with two juveniles. We argue that vigilance could constitute a prime indicator in behavior-based species conservation, and we suggesting a safe distance of at least 400 m should be considered in future tourist management.

TI  - Temporal Informative Analysis In Smart-Icu Monitoring: M-Healthcare Perspective
JO  - Journal of Medical Systems
PY  - 2016
AB  - The rapid introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology has boosted the service deliverance aspects of health sector in terms of m-health, and remote patient monitoring. IoT Technology is not only capable of sensing the acute details of sensitive events from wider perspectives, but it also provides a means to deliver services in time sensitive and efficient manner. Henceforth, IoT Technology has been efficiently adopted in different fields of the healthcare domain. In this paper, a framework for IoT based patient monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is presented to enhance the deliverance of curative services. Though ICUs remained a center of attraction for high quality care among researchers, still number of studies have depicted the vulnerability to a patient’s life during ICU stay. The work presented in this study addresses such concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of various events (and anomalies) with temporal associations, followed by time sensitive alert generation procedure. In order to validate the system, it was deployed in 3 ICU room facilities for 30 days in which nearly 81 patients were monitored during their ICU stay. The results obtained after implementation depicts that IoT equipped ICUs are more efficient in monitoring sensitive events as compared to manual monitoring and traditional Tele-ICU monitoring. Moreover, the adopted methodology for alert generation with information presentation further enhances the utility of the system. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Flood Hazard Mapping Of Donsol River Basin Using Lidar And Legazpi Rainfall Intensity Duration Frequency Curves
JO  - 37th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2016
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper presents the methods and results of Flood Hazard mapping of Donsol river basin through the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Legaspi Rainfall Intensity Duration Frequency (RIDF) Curves. Donsol River Basin is located in the province of Sorsogon, Philippines which is one of the river basins covered by the Ateneo de Naga University (ADNU) Phil-Lidar 1. This research project was funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD). Its objectives are to simulate the hydrologic model of Donsol River basin using HEC-HMS software developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center and to develop a flood hazard map based on Legazpi RIDF Curves. Its basin covers an area of 138.3 sq.km and the hydrologic model was calibrated using the storm event typhoon Ruby. Its parameter had undergone a series of optimization processes of HEC-HMS software in order to produce an acceptable level of model efficiency. The Nash-Sutcliffe (E), Percent Bias and Standard Deviation Ratio were used to measure the model efficiency, giving values of 0.8336, 0.0075 and 0.4080 respectively which resulted to a "very good" performance rating of the model. The flood inundation model was simulated using HEC-RAS software developed by the US Army corps of Engineers and a detailed 2D flood hazard map of Donsol river basin was prepared using FLO-2D software to assess the impact of flooding in the area. This Flood Hazard maps will provide the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (MDRRMO), Local Government units (LGUs) and the community a tool for flood mitigation and preparedness.

TI  - Pandemic 2009/10: Reflections On The Utility Of The Vaccination Actions In Hesse
JO  - GESUNDHEITSWESEN
PY  - 2014
AB  - In the state of Hesse (Germany) all vaccinations were administered either by the public health-care (oGD) or private health-care facilities and were registered by week and age group. In the following article, the benefit of the vaccination campaign will be looked at in terms of preventable consultations due to acute respiratory tract infections (AK-ARI). AK-ARI were registered with the nation-wide sentinel of the AGI. Scenarios regarding timing and age-specific coverage are modelled. The achieved timing and age distribution was compared to assumed ideal distributions, e.g., having achieved the final coverage 2 weeks before epidemic start or having applied the used vaccine exclusively for the most affected age group 5-14 years. The timing and coverage actually achieved (7\% overall) prevented an estimated 1.4\% or, respectively, 1.1\% of the total consultation excess. With the same amount of vaccine but ideally applied at least 2 weeks before the begin of the epidemic and exclusively to the age group of the 5- to 14-year olds, an estimated 13.9\% or, respectively, 18.2\% of the total excess could have been prevented. The simulated scenarios give estimations as to what benefit potentially could have been achieved during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Both the delayed successive access to vaccine and the not ideal age distribution reduced the benefit to about 30\% of the optimum. These exemplary estimates underline the importance of timeliness and valid prioritising of vaccination campaigns, although footing on just one outcome. It appears beneficial to reduce uncertainties for a solid prioritisation by, e.g., timely extended surveillance. Short-term decisions and adoptions are likely for future campaigns, e.g., due to unexpected changes in the epidemic, demanding flexibility in the application management.

TI  - Wilding Of A Post-Industrial Site Provides A Habitat Refuge For An Endangered Woodland Songbird, The British Willow Tit <I>Poecile Montanus Kleinschmidti</I>
JO  - BIRD STUDY
PY  - 2020
AB  - Capsule: Post-industrial sites that have become wilded by colonizing vegetation can represent important habitat refuges for Willow Tits Poecile montanus, which occupy large territories in early-successional wet woodland and scrub. Aims: To quantify Willow Tit population density and territory characteristics on a habitat mosaic of wetland, grassland and woodland/scrub, which has developed on a 596 ha area of former coal mining activities in northwest England. Methods: Field surveys located all 35-37 nests per year during 2017-2019. Territories were estimated using Thiessen polygons around nest sites. Remote sensing data (land cover mapping and lidar) characterized woody vegetation height and coverage across the site and within territories. Changes in coverage between 1990 and 2015 were assessed to estimate the age of woody vegetation. The relationship between territory size and woodland was tested to see if birds secure a similar area and volume of woody vegetation in each territory. Results: Mean breeding density was 7.3 pairs/km(2) (excluding 103 ha of ponds/lakes). Estimated territories averaged 13.7 ha, or 6.9 ha in wooded habitat only. The woodland and scrub were a maximum of 25-30 years old and had a mean height of 3.7 m. Larger territories contained a greater coverage and volume of wooded habitat. The site held 1.3\% of the national and global population of the British subspecies of Willow Tit. Conclusion: Willow Tits occur at low density and require large areas of habitat. Wilded post-industrial sites appear to be important for Willow Tit conservation in Britain, but may require ongoing management to maintain the early-successional woodland and scrub associated with new wetlands in former mining areas. Such sites may have a broader conservation value for a range of species.

TI  - Socio-Economic Benefits Of Using Space Technologies To Monitor And Respond To Earthquakes
JO  - International Astronautical Federation - 58th International Astronautical Congress 2007
PY  - 2007
AB  - Earthquakes represent a major hazard for populations around the world, causing frequent loss of life, human suffering, and enormous damage to homes, other buildings, and infrastructure. The Technology Resources for Earthquake Monitoring and Response (TREMOR) Team of 36 space professionals analyzed this problem over the course of the International Space University Summer Session Program and published their recommendations in the form of a report. The TREMOR Team proposes two space-based systems to provide improved capability to manage earthquakes. The first proposed system is an Earthquake Early Warning Prototype System that addresses the potential of earthquake precursors. We recommend the development of two satellites to study ionospheric and electromagnetic precursors. In combination with ground-based precursor research, the data gathered will improve existing knowledge of earthquake-related precursor phenomena. The second proposed system is an Earthquake Simulation and Response Prototype. An earthquake simulator will combine any available precursor data with detailed knowledge of the affected areas using a Geographic Information System to identify those areas that are most likely to experience the greatest level of damage. This is coupled with proposed mobile satellite communication hubs to provide links between response teams. Business and policy based implementation strategies for these proposals, such as the establishment of a nongovernmental organization to develop and operated the systems, are included.

TI  - Small Satellite Constellations - The Link To Economic Development And The Sustainable Development Agenda
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2017
AB  - The rationale for national space programs to motivate the development of science and technology capacity in many countries is well understood. The combination of this motivating factor and the continued evolution of small satellites combined with more affordable access to space and competitive launch opportunities, has in the past made it possible for developing countries to undertake space programs. The question of how a developing country can gain the benefit of undertaking a space technology program, while ensuring short term leverage from such a program in its economy over and above the long term benefits that accrue from such an undertaking has been presented in past research by the main author. The contribution of space to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been the topic of several panel discussion in various forums since the set of 17 SDGs were adopted in 2015. It is evident that there is consensus that satellite systems will play a critical role in supporting the achievement of the SDGs. The challenge however for developing nations to demonstrate the business case for space programmes and the link to economic development remains in order to compete for relatively limited public sector resources and developmental funds with notably socioeconomic developmental priorities in the areas of health, education and food security amongst other things. The paper considers the complex value proposition represented by nations, or economic trading blocs and regions, for investing in small satellite constellations as being fundamental in advancing the competitiveness in developing economies. By carefully combining the business cases of the short term, medium and long term, a developing country has to derive the benefits of investing in a space program for economic development but at the same time provide access to satellite systems in the quest for the achievement of these Sustainable Development Goals. © 2017 by the International Astronautical Federation.

TI  - Mapping Surface Water Erosion Potential In The Soummam Watershed In Northeast Algeria With Rusle Model
JO  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
PY  - 2019
AB  - The present study aims to estimate the annual soil loss in the Soummam watershed in the northeast of Algeria, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), geographic information system (GIS), and remote sensing (RS). RUSLE model has been used for modelling the main factors involved in erosive phenomena. The Soummam watershed covers a surface area of 9108.45 km(2) of irregular shape, northeast -southwest towards southeast. It is characterized by an altitude varying between 2 m in the northeast and 2308 m in the northwest. Results showed that the average erosivity factor (R) is 70.64 (MJmm)/(hahyear) and the maximum value reaches 140 (MJmm)/(hahyear), the average soil erodibility factor (K) is 0.016 (thha)/(MJhamm) and maximum values reach 0.0204 (thha)/(MJhamm) in the southeast regions of the watershed, the average slope length and steepness factor (LS) is 9.79 and the mean C factor is estimated to be 0.62. Thematic maps integration of different factors of RUSLE in GIS with their database, allowed with a rapid and efficient manner to highlight complexity and factors interdependence in the erosion risk analyses. The resulting map for soils losses, with an average erosion rate of 6.81 t/(hayear) shows a low erosion (<7.41 t/(hayear)) which covers 73.46\% of the total area of the basin, and a medium erosion (7.42 to 19.77 t/(hayear)), which represents 17.66\% of the area. Areas with extreme erosion risk exceeding 32.18 t/(hayear) cover more than 3.54\% of the basin area. The results can certainly aid in implementation of soil management and conservation practices to reduce the soil erosion in the Soummam watershed.

TI  - Evaluation Of Deep Learning Benchmarks In Retrieving Outfalls Into Rivers With Uas Images
JO  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Outfall surveys are critical to basin environmental and ecosystem protection. High-spatial-resolution remote sensing has been a key technology in outfall surveys. However, manual visual interpretation of outfalls from unmanned aircraft system (UAS) images is inefficient. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning method has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate method for retrieving specific objects from remote sensing imagery. However, CNN's architecture and features are often proposed to detect common objects from universal images that are less complex than the specific remote sensing objects. Thus, an optimal CNN benchmark is significant to the performance of CNN-based approaches in the field of remote sensing. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art CNN architectures and features for improving the geo-deep learning CNN for outfalls (GDCNN-outfalls) we proposed. We found that Faster R-CNN combined with feature pyramid network (FPN) and generalized intersection over union (GIoU) or complete intersection over union (CIoU) are the most suitable benchmarks, with AP(50) values of 68.7 and 67.0, respectively, which are better than those of cascade R-CNN (AP(50) of 64.6) and Libra R-CNN (AP(50) of 62.7). You only look once (YOLO)-v4 can be an alternative with an AP(50) of 66.8 and comprehensively considers retrieval accuracy, the current GPU performance, and the application needs. This result indicates that the latest CNN models in the field of computer vision are not always the most suitable benchmarks for specific object retrievals from remote sensing imagery. Our study also provides a typical workflow for the relevant CNN-based model designs and applications.

TI  - Endorheic Waterbodies Delineation From Remote Sensing As A Tool For Immersed Surface Topography
JO  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
PY  - 2022
AB  - For several decades, it becomes possible to delineate waterbodies and their dynamics from optical or radar images, that are now available at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We present here an interpolation approach that takes benefits from this waterbodies delineation in endorheic areas. It consists in computing isovalue contour lines to improve topography estimates classically obtained from measurement points only. The approach, based on a minimization problem, uses thin plate spline (TPS) interpolation functions, the coefficients of which are determined along with the unknown water level of each curve. Results obtained on a generated topography show that this approach, applied with three contour-line curves, yields a lower root mean square error (RMSE) using only one measurement point compared to the one obtained with nine points and the classical approach.

TI  - Planning For The Next Influenza H1n1 Season: A Modelling Study
JO  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: The level of herd immunity before and after the first 2009 pandemic season is not precisely known, and predicting the shape of the next pandemic H1N1 season is a difficult challenge. Methods: This was a modelling study based on data on medical visits for influenza-like illness collected by the French General Practitioner Sentinel network, as well as pandemic H1N1 vaccination coverage rates, and an individual-centred model devoted to influenza. We estimated infection attack rates during the first 2009 pandemic H1N1 season in France, and the rates of pre- and post-exposure immunity. We then simulated various scenarios in which a pandemic influenza H1N1 virus would be reintroduced into a population with varying levels of protective cross-immunity, and considered the impact of extending influenza vaccination. Results: During the first pandemic season in France, the proportion of infected persons was 18.1\% overall, 38.3\% among children, 14.8\% among younger adults and 1.6\% among the elderly. The rates of pre-exposure immunity required to fit data collected during the first pandemic season were 36\% in younger adults and 85\% in the elderly. We estimated that the rate of post-exposure immunity was 57.3\% (95\% Confidence Interval (95\% CI) 49.6\%-65.0\%) overall, 44.6\% (95\% CI 35.5\%-53.6\%) in children, 53.8\% (95\% CI 44.5\%-63.1\%) in younger adults, and 87.4\% (95\% CI 82.0\%-92.8\%) in the elderly. The shape of a second season would depend on the degree of persistent protective cross-immunity to descendants of the 2009 H1N1 viruses. A cross-protection rate of 70\% would imply that only a small proportion of the population would be affected. With a cross-protection rate of 50\%, the second season would have a disease burden similar to the first, while vaccination of 50\% of the entire population, in addition to the population vaccinated during the first pandemic season, would halve this burden. With a cross-protection rate of 30\%, the second season could be more substantial, and vaccination would not provide a significant benefit. Conclusions: These model-based findings should help to prepare for a second pandemic season, and highlight the need for studies of the different components of immune protection.

TI  - Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (Lvas): A Case Study From Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia
JO  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE
PY  - 2017
AB  - The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury, fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3) interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 \% damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25\% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26 - 50\% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75\% damage/victims/period), and 1.00 (75 - 100\% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are compiled and analyzed with "Landslide Distribution Map" (LDM) to generate a "Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD)". The LDM was produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally, three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 (< 0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability; Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High Vulnerability); and Class 5 (> 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially to be extended with different background environments.

TI  - The Benefits Of Small Satellites And Space Technology Applications For Developing Countries: Peru Case Unsasat-1
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2021
AB  - In recent years, the use of small satellites, in many cases known as CubeSat, have been increasing considerably. Mainly because the CubeSat cost benefit indicator in the mission design in comparison to the conventional satellites. what's more, thanks to the continuous development in the field, the space technology applications of CubeSat are reaching to solve the needs of the society just like the normal satellites does, and more. Peru is a country mostly located over the Andes Chain Mountains in South America. Which result in eight altitudinal tiers along the country giving a vast variety of ecosystems. In consequence each ecosystem has their own needs and challenges (e.g. the difficult access to populated remote areas). The applications to solve the needs with CubeSat are for example data acquisition in the remote areas, satellite communication, IoT, 5G, etc. The UNSAsaT-1 small satellite is the first of a 3 satellite constellation, designed by a team of students, professors, and professionals in the Astronomical Aerospace Pedro Paulet Institute (IAPP) of the National University of Saint Agustin of Arequipa, Peru (UNSA) to provide multifunctional services such as remote sensing, internet of things (IoT), and space technology education. The small satellite is based on a 3U CubeSat platform which is expected to have 1 to 2 years of orbit life. The UNSAsaT-1 is designed as a high cost performance, where an important part of its design is the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS). Consider that the small satellite has one 3 axis magnetic torque and four reaction wheels in a pyramid configuration as the actuators. The dynamic modelling, simulation and control techniques have been designed for a rigid body. Different control algorithms are adopted and compared. A quaternion feedback controller (PD), and sliding mode regulator is investigated for the UNSAsaT-1 small satellite. The simulation results of the comparative study and the attitude control design based on the UNSAsaT-1 CubeSat are presented. © 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF. All rights reserved.

TI  - Road Identification Algorithm For Remote Sensing Images Based On Wavelet Transform And Recursive Operator
JO  - IEEE ACCESS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Road edge detection from remote sensing images, as an important ground object type, plays an important role in people's life and travel and urban planning and development, and extracting road information from remote sensing images has practical scientific value and practical significance. However, with the development of remote sensing technology, while the resolution of remote sensing images is improved, the information describing ground objects becomes more and more abundant, and the difficulty of identifying and extracting road information is also increased. In the process of acquiring remote sensing images, the actual system is subjected to various kinds of noise interference. Different environmental interference and system defects will introduce noises with completely different distribution and statistical characteristics to remote sensing images. Aiming at the problem that the detection effect of traditional algorithms becomes worse due to the influence of noise on remote sensing images, a wavelet transform denoising method and morphological gradient operator are proposed. By selecting appropriate structural elements of remote sensing images, noise pixels cannot participate in morphological calculation, and the noise intensity changes with the size of quantum superposition state structural elements. Therefore, a morphological gradient operator is established and applied to edge detection of remote sensing images. Finally, the experimental results show that the method proposed in this article is better than other directions in terms of effect through road edge detection and matching. This method can effectively reduce noise. Compared with other algorithms, the method proposed in this article has certain advantages.

TI  - Solar Energy Technology For Northern Cyprus: Assessment, Statistical Analysis, And Feasibility Study
JO  - ENERGIES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Solar power is the fastest-growing energy source in the world. New technologies can help to generate more power from solar energy. The present paper aims to encourage people and the government to develop solar energy-based power projects to achieve sustainable energy infrastructures, especially in developing countries. In addition, this paper presents a solar energy road map to attract investors to invest in clean energy technology to help reduce the effect of global warming and enhance sustainable technological development. Therefore, the first objective of the paper is to analyze and compare the monthly global solar radiation for five different locations in Northern Cyprus using the measured data collected from the Meteorological Department and estimated values collected from the satellite imagery database. In addition, the mean hourly meteorological parameters including global solar radiation, air temperature, sunshine, and relative humidity are analyzed statistically and the type of distribution functions are selected based on skewness and kurtosis values. Accordingly, estimating global solar radiation improves solar power generation planning and reduces the cost of measuring. Therefore, models of a surface were analyzed by means of polynomial adjustments considering the values of R-squared. Finally, this study provides a comprehensive and integrated feasibility analysis of a 100 MW grid-connected solar plant project as an economic project in the selected region to reduce electricity tariffs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. RETScreen Expert software was used to conduct the feasibility analysis in terms of energy production, GHG emissions, and financial parameters for the best location for the installation of a 100 MW grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) plant. Finally, the results concluded that the proposed solar system could be used for power generation in Northern Cyprus.

TI  - Canopy Of Advantage: Who Benefits Most From City Trees?
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban tree canopy provides a suite of ecological, social, and economic benefits to the residents of urban areas. With an expanding recognition of these benefits among city residents, there is growing concern that access to these benefits is not distributed equally and may represent the presence of an environmental injustice. This study examines the spatial relationship between median household income and tree canopy variables, specifically realized tree canopy cover and potential tree canopy cover, for Toronto, Canada. Toronto provides a strong empirical focus as it is a densely populated urban setting reported to be exhibiting an increase in the geographic polarization of residents based upon household income. Spatial relationships between median household income and tree canopy variables are evaluated using the bivariate Moran's I statistic, a specialized local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). This method explicitly identified where statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low household income coincide with significant clusters of high and low urban tree canopy, providing the basis for an examination of the policies and management decisions that led to this temporal snapshot. The importance of these spatial clusters is examined from the perspective of understanding the impact of urban change (both socio-demographic and built form), and from the standpoint of improving equality of access to city trees and their benefits resulting from future tree planting decisions.

TI  - Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Uav Itinerary Planning For Remote Sensing Applications In Smart Farming
JO  - Telecom
PY  - 2021
AB  - UAV path planning for remote sensing aims to find the best-fitted routes to complete a data collection mission. UAVs plan the routes and move through them to remotely collect environmental data from particular target zones by using sensory devices such as cameras. Route planning may utilize machine learning techniques to autonomously find/select cost-effective and/or best-fitted routes and achieve optimized results including: minimized data collection delay, reduced UAV power consumption, decreased flight traversed distance and maximized number of collected data samples. This paper utilizes a reinforcement learning technique (location and energy-aware Q-learning) to plan UAV routes for remote sensing in smart farms. Through this, the UAV avoids heuristically or blindly moving throughout a farm, but this takes the benefits of environment exploration–exploitation to explore the farm and find the shortest and most cost-effective paths into target locations with interesting data samples to collect. According to the simulation results, utilizing the Q-learning technique increases data collection robustness and reduces UAV resource consumption (e.g., power), traversed paths, and remote sensing latency as compared to two well-known benchmarks, IEMF and TBID, especially if the target locations are dense and crowded in a farm. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Changes In Floodplain Productivity And Freshwater Habitats In Northern Australia (1991-2019)
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2020
AB  - The ecological communities supported by freshwater habitats and wetlands that persist from floodplain inundation generate numerous cultural, recreational and economic values via commercial fisheries and other human uses of these habitats. However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991-2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r = 0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r = 0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r = 0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r = 0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems).

TI  - Open Service Innovation For A New Space Economy
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2016
AB  - Satellite-based data is becoming increasingly available and precise, and it has worked its way into many applications that support our everyday lives. Wishing to harness the economic potential of this data, governments are attempting to kickstart a New Space Economy, using enabling technologies such as ICT and collaborative environments as spelled out by the open innovation paradigm, in order to stimulate the creation of commercial downstream services around the available information. This paper examines how open innovation principles are and could further be applied in the context of space downstream services, specifically exploring the European Galileo and Copernicus programs, in order to support the emergence of a new service-based economy. Indeed, in the global context, an increasing proportion of companies' revenues stems from services, and these are becoming a key differentiation tool in the competitive landscape. Space-based services could therefore supply companies with new business models that will enable them to keep abreast of their competitors and provide a higher value to customers. Open innovation occurs when companies do not only rely on their internal processes and RD to perform innovation, engaging the whole spectrum of available collaborators and stakeholders to bring new ideas to market. The stream of open services innovation specifically studies how to apply open innovation principles to the realm of service management, in order to develop innovative services that better embrace customers' needs. Key principles of this type of innovation include re-designing business models from product-based to service-based models, built around the concept of customer utility. Customers should also be fully engaged in co-creation processes, helping to shape services around their specific needs and providing real-time feedback on the business models being implemented. In an open innovation approach, a specialisation should be sought between complementary actors such as suppliers, competitors and key stakeholders in order to create more efficient processes, where assets and knowledge can be shared. Finally the use of platforms to standardise information and to communicate between actors should be encouraged. A more in-depth elaboration of this model will be presented with practical examples and recommendations for key stakeholders. Copyright © 2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

TI  - Tree Crown Delineation Algorithm Based On A Convolutional Neural Network
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Tropical forests concentrate the largest diversity of species on the planet and play a key role in maintaining environmental processes. Due to the importance of those forests, there is growing interest in mapping their components and getting information at an individual tree level to conduct reliable satellite-based forest inventory for biomass and species distribution qualification. Individual tree crown information could be manually gathered from high resolution satellite images; however, to achieve this task at large-scale, an algorithm to identify and delineate each tree crown individually, with high accuracy, is a prerequisite. In this study, we propose the application of a convolutional neural network-Mask R-CNN algorithm-to perform the tree crown detection and delineation. The algorithm uses very high-resolution satellite images from tropical forests. The results obtained are promising-the Recall, Precision, and F1 score values obtained were were 0.81, 0.91, and 0.86, respectively. In the study site, the total of tree crowns delineated was 59,062. These results suggest that this algorithm can be used to assist the planning and conduction of forest inventories. As the algorithm is based on a Deep Learning approach, it can be systematically trained and used for other regions.

TI  - Conservation Farming And Changing Climate: More Beneficial Than Conventional Methods For Degraded Ugandan Soils
JO  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
PY  - 2017
AB  - The extent of land affected by degradation in Uganda ranges from 20% in relatively flat and vegetation-covered areas to 90% in the eastern and southwestern highlands. Land degradation has adversely affected smallholder agro-ecosystems including direct damage and loss of critical ecosystem services such as agricultural land/soil and biodiversity. This study evaluated the extent of bare grounds in Nakasongola, one of the districts in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda and the yield responses of maize (Zea mays) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to different tillage methods in the district. Bare ground was determined by a supervised multi-band satellite image classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Field trials on maize and bean grain yield responses to tillage practices used a randomized complete block design with three replications, evaluating conventional farmer practice (CFP); permanent planting basins (PPB); and rip lines, with or without fertilizer in maize and bean rotations. Bare ground coverage in the Nakasongola District was 187 km2 (11%) of the 1741 km2 of arable land due to extreme cases of soil compaction. All practices, whether conventional or the newly introduced conservation farming practices in combination with fertilizer increased bean and maize grain yields, albeit with minimal statistical significance in some cases. The newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the bean grain yield relative to conventional practices by 41% in PPBs and 43% in rip lines. In maize, the newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the grain yield by 78% on average, relative to conventional practices. Apparently, conservation farming tillage methods proved beneficial relative to conventional methods on degraded soils, with the short-term benefit of increasing land productivity leading to better harvests and food security. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Ecological Characterization Of High Altitude Himalayan Landscapes In The Upper Satluj River Watershed, Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, India
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS III satellite imagery was used to classify three landscapes in the upper Satluj river watershed in Kinnaur region of western Himalaya viz. Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh. These landscapes representing different eco-climatic zones were subjected to landscape ecological analysis and various landscape composition, patch and edge characteristic metrics were computed to find the extent of fragmentation in the natural vegetation. The natural vegetation comprised of forests (10.24\%), grasslands (31.04\%) and scrublands (2.95\%) as the landscape elements (LSE). These LSEs were further segregated into different LSE types based on the dominant species of plant communities in the landscapes. These LSE types were surveyed for species diversity in the three landscapes. The total landscape area (TLA) covered by natural vegetation in Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh landscapes was calculated to be 651.42, 529.02 and 1,673.72 km(2) making the total area covered with natural vegetation in the district as 2,854.16 km(2). The Pooh block, lying in the east of the district, though covered the largest area of the landscape, was poor in terms of landscape composition as compared to the Nichar block which was rich in landscape elements as suggested by the diversity measures. The extent of fragmentation was found to be highest in Nichar. The Nichar landscape was observed to be having higher mean values of species diversity than other blocks which is consistent with the trends observed with patches diversity. This was in contrast to the Pooh landscape where the patch diversity as well as the species diversity was the lowest. Thus, an ecological analysis utilizing landscape metrics and biodiversity field sampling of vegetation, was attempted for such heterogenous landscapes in high altitudes of Himalaya, which provided a baseline data for the management and conservation of these virgin mountainous areas.

TI  - Management Of Nstemi In A Hospital Without Interventional Cardiology And Without Use Of Grace Score: Does The Clinician Appreciation Match The Grace Score Calculated Retrospectively For The Coronarography Delay?
JO  - Annales de Cardiologie et d'Angeiologie
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose: The management of non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) remains an issue for mobidity, mortality, and an economic stake. The first aim of the study was to evaluate the additional value of the GRACE score for the compliance with the recommended times to coronary angiography in an hospital without interventional cardiology. We also analysed the in-hospital and 6-month mortality and the predictive factors of compliance for the coronarography delays. Methods: Retrospective monocenter cross-sectional study including consecutive patients with chest pain suggestive of a NSTEACS during 1 year. Data of the delay to coronarography were collected and GRACE score was calculated a posteriori. Results: The time to perform coronary angiography was non-compliant in 49% of cases (27 patients out of 55). The calculation of the GRACE score would have allowed correcting the delay for two patients of our cohort. Clinical appreciation, troponin elevation, ECG modifications were associated with the delay compliance. Age < 75 years predisposed to recommended delays. Renal failure and history of coronaropathy were significantly associated with non compliant delays. A non-compliant delay was significantly associated with higher mortality. Conclusion: In our experience, the knowledge of the GRACE score had little impact on the timing of coronary angiography. However, as a predictor of mid and long term mortality, GRACE score remains SCA ST+ useful to intensify surveillance of high-risk patients. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

TI  - Latent Heat Flux Variability And Response To Drought Stress Of Black Poplar: A Multi-Platform Multi-Sensor Remote And Proximal Sensing Approach To Relieve The Data Scarcity Bottleneck
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - High-throughput mapping of latent heat flux (MET) is critical to efforts to optimize water resources management and to accelerate forest tree breeding for improved drought tolerance. Ideally, investigation of the energy response at the tree level may promote tailored irrigation strategies and, thus, maximize crop biomass productivity. However, data availability is limited and planning experimental campaigns in the field can be highly operationally complex. To this end, a multi-platform multi-sensor observational approach is herein developed to dissect the MET signature of a black poplar (Populus nigra) breeding population ("POP6") at the canopy level. POP6 comprised more than 4600 trees representing 503 replicated genotypes, whose parents were derived from contrasting environmental conditions. Trees were trialed in two adjacent plots where different irrigation treatments (moderate drought {[}mDr] and well-watered {[}WW]) were applied. Data collected from satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remote sensing as well as from ground-based proximal sensors were integrated at consistent spatial aggregation and combined to compute the surface energy balance of the trees through a modified Priestley-Taylor method. Here, we demonstrated that MET response was significantly different between WW and mDr trees, whereby genotypes in mDr conditions exhibited larger standard deviations. Importantly, genotypes classified as drought tolerant based on the stress susceptibility index (SSI) presented MET values significantly higher than the rest of the population. This study confirmed that water limitation in mDr settings led to reduced soil moisture in the tree root zone and, thus, to lower MET. These results pave the way to breeding poplar and other bioenergy crops with this underexploited trait for higher MET. Most notably, the illustrated work demonstrates a multi-platform multi-sensor data fusion approach to tackle the global challenge of monitoring landscape-scale ecosystem processes at fine resolution.

TI  - Correlates Of Long-Term Land-Cover Change And Protected Area Performance At Priority Conservation Sites In Africa
JO  - Environmental Conservation
PY  - 2018
AB  - The loss of natural habitats is a major threat to biodiversity, and protected area designation is one of the standard responses to this threat. However, greater understanding of the drivers of habitat loss and of the circumstances under which protected areas succeed or fail is still needed. We use visual assessment of satellite images to quantify land-cover change over periods of up to 30 years in and around a matched sample of protected and unprotected Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) in Africa. We modelled the annual survival of forests and other natural land covers as a function of a range of environmental and anthropic predictors of plausible drivers. The best-supported model indicated that survival rates of natural land cover were highest in steeper areas, at higher altitudes, in areas with lower human population densities and in areas where the cover of natural habitats was already higher at the start of the period. Survival rates of natural land cover in protected areas were, on average, around twice those in unprotected areas, but the differences between them varied along different environmental gradients. The overall survival rates of both protected and unprotected forests were significantly lower than those of other natural land-cover types, but the net benefit of protection, in terms of the absolute difference in rates of loss between protected and unprotected sites, was higher in forests. Interaction terms indicated that as slope and altitude increased, the natural protection offered by topography increasingly nullified the additional benefits of legislative protection. Furthermore, protected area designation offered reduced additional benefits to the survival of natural land cover in areas where rates of conversion were higher at the start of the observation period. Variation in the impacts of protected area status along different environmental gradients indicates that targets to improve the world's protected area network, such as Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, need to look beyond simple area-based metrics. Our methods and results contribute to the development of a protocol for prioritizing places where protection is likely to have the greatest effect.

TI  - Increased Water Use Efficiency In China And Its Drivers During 2000–2016
JO  - Ecosystems
PY  - 2022
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the carbon uptake per unit of water consumption, is a critical indicator of the coupling between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in WUE and its drivers is vital for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Herein, we used a remote sensing-driven analytical model to estimate spatiotemporal variations of WUE in China during 2000–2016 and quantified its key drivers. The simulated WUE matched well with the eddy covariance observations across different ecosystems in China, with coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.81. The annual WUE increased significantly at a rate of 0.021 g C mm−1 H2O y−1 (P < 0.01), with the mean value of 1.62 g C mm−1 H2O during 2000–2016. Analyses based on a factorial experiment (FE) and the sensitivity method (SE) showed that the increased leaf area index was the largest contributor to the increase in WUE, with contributions of 50.1% and 42.8% determined via FE and SE, respectively. CO2 enrichment was the second largest contributor (FE: 20.7% and SE: 31.4%), followed by the decrease in the vapor pressure deficit (FE: 15.4% and SE: 13.4%). The increased ratio of water loss by canopy interaction had a negative impact on WUE due to the increased non-productive water loss. Although these attributions had some inherent uncertainties, the results highlighted that the significant greening in China, which was mainly caused by human land-use management, and increased CO2 concentrations significantly promoted WUE during the recent 17 years. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Introducing A New Remote Sensing-Based Model For Forecasting Forest Fire Danger Conditions At A Four-Day Scale
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Forest fires are natural disasters that create a significant risk to the communities living in the vicinity of forested landscape. To minimize the risk of forest fires for the resilience of such urban communities and forested ecosystems, we proposed a new remote sensing-based medium-term (i.e., four-day) forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS) based on an existing framework, and applied the system over the forested regions in the northern Alberta, Canada. Hence, we first employed moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived daily land surface temperature (Ts) and surface reflectance products along with the annual land cover to generate three four-day composite for Ts, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) at 500 m spatial resolution for the next four days over the forest-dominant regions. Upon generating these four-day composites, we calculated the variable-specific mean values to determine variable-specific fire danger maps with two danger classes (i.e., high and low). Then, by assuming the cloud-contaminated pixels as the low fire danger areas, we combined these three danger maps to generate a four-day fire danger map with four danger classes (i.e., low, moderate, high, and very high) over our study area of interest, which was further enhanced by incorporation of a human-caused static fire danger map. Finally, the four-day scale fire danger maps were evaluated using observed/ground-based forest fire occurrences during the 2015-2017 fire seasons. The results revealed that our proposed system was able to detect about 75\% of the fire events in the top two danger classes (i.e., high and very high). The system was also able to predict the 2016 Horse River wildfire, the worst fire event in Albertian and Canadian history, with about 67\% agreement. The higher accuracy outputs from our proposed model indicated that it could be implemented in the operational management, which would be very useful for lessening the adverse impact of such fire events.

TI  - Crystal: A Method And Software Package To Project Steady State Conditions Of A Product Using Transient Monotonic Or Cyclic Data
JO  - SAE Technical Papers

AB  - A novel analytical procedure for projecting the steady state conditions of transient data is presented. In addition to the basic application of the method to monotonically changing data, this method has been extended to the case of cyclic data, for which only a coarse cyclic pattern is required to project cyclicly repeatable maximum and minimum expected values. The procedure which has been implemented, using the commercial software LOTUS 1-2-3 Version 3.1 on an IBM PC, is easily transportable and can conveniently be used at a test site. Results from application to satellite solar beam test temperature data are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the method and the attendant potential for test time savings. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.

TI  - The Establishment Of Sperm Morphology Satellite Training Laboratories In Africa

AB  - Discrepancies in the results of semen analysis can be caused by a variety of factors, for example, a microscope for semen analysis can be situated in the practice of an urologist, cytologist or microbiologist, or even in a health care office in the countryside in a developing country. The study aimed to evaluate the (i) sperm morphology assessment skills of the participants who attended WHO seminology workshops and (ii) to appraise the possibility of using trained technologists to set up satellite training facilities in their own area. The Centre for Research in Reproductive Health, Ogun State University Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) initiated training sessions in their area. Subsequently, 16 technologists were trained in three sessions. Papanicolaou-stained slides, supplied by Tygerberg were used as test material. Pre- and post-training results were used to calculate the mean percentage of normal cells as well as the percentage deviation from the reference laboratory. The mean percentage normal spermatozoa recorded by the Nigerian trainees during pre-training evaluations differed by 38% from the reference value, compared with a post-training difference of 16% (P < 0.001). Tertiary academic hospitals can play an important educational role in the region. The present results underline the power of long distance educational programmes. Similar laboratories are currently being set up in Kenya and Zambia. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Estimation Of Land Surface Temperature From Landsat-8 Oli: Comparative Analysis Of Two Periods For Duzce In Turkey
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
PY  - 2024
AB  - In this study, using Landsat 8 OLI satellite images, Duzce province 2013 and 2021 land surface temperature data were calculated and it was aimed to determine land surface temperature values according to land-use classes. In addition, correlations were examined according to six different vegetation indexes. In the areal distribution of land surface temperature data, it was determined that 59.7\% of the entire area was distributed between 25 and 30 degrees C in 2013, and 53.3\% between 20 and 25 degrees C in 2021. The normalized difference vegetation index, which is used extensively, especially in studies related to vegetation, has the highest average values of broad-leaved forest areas in both periods. In the relations between land surface temperature values and vegetation indexes, a positive correlation with normalized difference built-up index and a negative correlation with other vegetation indexes were found. Correlation values between land surface temperature and vegetation indexes in 2021 were higher than in 2013. The highest correlation values were obtained in the normalized difference built-up index in 2013 and 2021 with correlation values of 0.62 (R-2: 0.39) and 0.73 (R-2: 0.54), respectively. While a correlation of 0.68 (R-2: 0.46) was found with the NDVI index in 2021, a correlation of 0.55 (R-2: 0.30) was obtained in 2013. The lowest correlation was found in the renormalized difference vegetation index with ratios of 0.66 (R-2: 0.44) in 2021 and 0.47 (R-2: 0.22) in 2013. In addition, significant and positive spatial autocorrelations were obtained according to Moran I and LISA statistical analysis in both years. Moran's I values were found to be 0.607 (p < 0.05) in 2013 and 0.791 (p < 0.05) in 2021, and it was determined that there were significant clusters according to LISA. Understanding the effects of the spatial distribution of Land use-land change and its variation over time on the land surface temperature can be incorporated into environmental health and sustainable urban planning and contribute to planners.

TI  - Integrating Analyses Of Local Land-Use Regulations, Cultural Perceptions And Land-Use/Land Cover Data For Assessing The Success Of Community-Based Conservation
JO  - Forest Ecology and Management
PY  - 2006
AB  - Studies of land-use/land cover change are an important means for examining the viability of community-based programs for forest conservation, although an analysis of the social processes influencing land-use decisions is necessary to understand the factors leading to different conservation outcomes. In this paper, we demonstrate that an analysis of locally recognized land-use rules and regulations embedded in local institutions can inform remote-sensing approaches by helping: (1) to elucidate some of the local perceptions, criteria and interactions with outside agencies that drive conservation actions and (2) to better interpret the spatial patterns of land-use change and forest conservation revealed by remote-sensing data. Based on a case study of a forest ejido from the Maya Zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico, we evaluate changes in forest cover and in local land-use regulations before and after the initiation in the mid-1980s of a community forestry program, the Plan Piloto Forestal (PPF). Methods included development of a time series of land cover maps based on LANDSAT imagery from 1976, 1988, 1991, 1997 and 2000, as well as interviews and participant observation with local farmers and community leaders. Results indicate a high degree of forest conservation on community lands with net rates of forest loss of 0.6-0.7%/year. Locally recognized conservation regulations included a number of forest reserves as well as regulations which protect specific forest types, resulting from both local initiatives and interventions of external agencies. These initiatives included but were not limited to the PPF, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-based conservation programs within a broader historical context. Conservation regulations protecting an important commercial non-timber forest product (Manilkara zapota) pre-dated the PPF and may have facilitated its implementation. In the most accessible agricultural areas, the only mature forest patches were customary forest reserves and an area regenerated from secondary forests, protected due to enrichment plantings of commercial timbers. Recognition of local Maya terminology used to distinguish forest types was crucial for proper interpretation of local land-use regulations, which revealed that less-valued forest types may not be adequately protected on community lands. We suggest that future research should examine the significance of the less-valued forest types for global biodiversity conservation. In addition careful consideration of the historical antecedents and community institutions which may have facilitated the implementation of the Plan Piloto Forestal will be important for the successful application of this model of community forestry to other socio-economic and cultural contexts. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

JO  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
PY  - 2011
AB  - For dermatologists, evidence-based management guidelines for Spitz tumors have not been established. Despite the lack of a standardized approach, most dermatologists recommend the excision of Spitz tumors occurring in adults and adopt more conservative measures towards pediatric cases. The histopathologic attributes and the clinical scenario are factored into management in each case. While the metastatic behavior of certain Spitz tumors is well known, the malignant potential of these lesions remains unclear because they only rarely result in negative outcomes. The risks and benefits of adjunctive measures, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy and interferon use, remain untested and are subjects of ongoing controversy. (In part II of this continuing medical education article, we will continue to use the terminology defined in part I for purposes of continuity. "Spitz tumor" is used as the umbrella term for the entire category of lesions, "common Spitz nevi" refers to only the most typical lesions seen in pediatric cases, and "atypical Spitz tumors" encompass the "all other" category, which continues to cause debate.)

TI  - Test Station For Ccsds Based Data Handling Systems Of Mini Satellites
JO  - Proceedings of 2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies, ICACCCT 2012
PY  - 2012
AB  - Mini satellites are highly in demand due to the low cost , fast turn around time and multiple applications like new space technologies verification, analysis of anthropogenic effects on earth, observation of phenomenon's of earth like the surveillance of lightning on the upper atmosphere, environmental monitoring, earth imaging, research, climatic monitoring, etc. Spacecraft development involves rigorous testing before qualification. This has created a huge challenge for developing a robust test station to deliver high quality subsystems for small satellite applications. Developing such a test station for subsystems reduces the cost and testing time of the overall spacecraft development and increases the reliability of the subsystems. Consultative committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has come up with the recommendation of standardizing the payload data format and the telemetry format that makes the cross ground support possible. This paper addresses the design and development of a test station that is suitable to test BDH that is meant for CCSDS complied operational class small satellite missions. The test station includes the architecture of various simulators and necessary utilities required to test the entire base band data handling system. The paper also address the configurable/programmable hardware and software that allow to reuse for different interfaces of the system with other subsystems to meet multiple satellite missions. This ensures that there will be a large market for the t est station, thus encourages mass production. © 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Device-Based Remote Monitoring: Current Evidence
JO  - Herzschrittmachertherapie und Elektrophysiologie
PY  - 2017
AB  - Telemedicine is increasingly used in clinical cardiology. It offers early detection of arrhythmias, technical device follow-up and support of heart failure management. Regarding technical device follow-up, remote monitoring significantly reduces usage of the health care system. Furthermore, remote monitoring is associated with a significantly reduced time from device malfunction to physician’s perception of the event. Using remote monitoring, inappropriate ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) shocks can be significantly reduced compared to routine in-office follow-up. In retrospective studies and meta-analyses a prognostic benefit with respect to mortality has been shown. Device-based detection of atrial fibrillation and atrial high rate episodes is feasible. However, clinical relevance is currently studied in prospective randomized clinical trials. Heart failure management based on surrogate parameters has not been shown to significantly improve outcome. However, therapeutic management based on pulmonary artery pressure has been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. This review offers a comprehensive overview on the role of remote monitoring in heart failure management, technical device follow-up and detection of atrial fibrillation and atrial high rate episodes. © 2017, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH.

TI  - Using Landsat And Sentinel-2 Spectral Time Series To Detect East African Small Woodlots
JO  - Science of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate maps of gains in tree cover are necessary to quantify carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and land use changes. Satellite-based mapping of emerging smallholder woodlots in heterogeneous landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa is challenging. Our goal was to evaluate the use of time series to detect and map small woodlots (<1 ha) in Tanzania. We distinguished woodlots from other land cover types by woodlots' distinct multi-year spectral time series. Woodlots exhibit greening from planting to maturity followed by browning at harvest. We compared two time series approaches: 1) a linear model of Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) and other indices, and 2) LandTrendr temporal segmentation metrics. The approaches had equivalent woodlot detection accuracy, but LandTrendr segments had lower accuracy for characterizing woodlot age. We tested the effect of the following factors on woodlot detection and mapping accuracy: the length of the time series (2009–2019), frequency of observations (all Landsat vs. only Landsat-8), spatial resolution (30-m Landsat vs. 10-m Sentinel-2), and woodlot age and size. Woodlot mapping accuracies were higher with longer time series (54% at 3-yrs vs 77% at 7-yrs). The accuracies also improved with more observations, especially when the time series was short (3-yrs Landsat-8 only: 54% vs. all-Landsat: 64%, p-value <0.001). Sentinel-2's higher spatial resolution minimized commission errors even for short time series. Finally, less than half of young and small (<0.4 ha) woodlots were detected, suggesting considerable omission errors in our and other woodlot maps. Our results suggest that the accurate detection of woodlots is possible by analyzing multi-year time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. Given the region's woodlot boom, accurate maps are needed to better quantify woodlots' contribution to carbon sequestration, livelihoods enhancement, and landscape management. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Bias Correction Framework For Satellite Precipitation Products Using A Rain/No Rain Discriminative Model
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Despite the benefits of global coverage with high spatiotemporal resolutions, satellite precipitation products (SPPs) still suffer from inadequate accuracy in natural hazard forecasts, hydrology, and water resources management. Rain/no-rain (R/NR) detection error significantly affects the accuracy of daily SPPs, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposed a precipitation bias correction framework (PBCF) to improve the accuracy of daily SPPs, focusing on improving the ability of SPPs to detect the occurrence of the precipitation based on a R/NR discriminative model. Multiple land and climate variables derived from ERA5Land reanalysis dataset were used to construct the R/NR discriminative model using the artificial neural network (ANN) method. A case study on the bias correction of daily precipitation of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) over Hanjiang River Basin (HRB) was conducted for the period 2004-2018. Daily precipitation of 64 meteorological stations in HRB were spatially and randomly divided into two groups: 44 stations were used for training, validating and testing the constructed R/NR discriminative model, and the other 20 stations were used to evaluate the performance of the R/NR discriminative model in different topographic areas. The results indicate that the proposed PBCF could reduce the bias of IMERG, with the correlation coefficient (R) increased by 19.4\%, the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 19.0\% and 29.8\% on the daily scale, respectively. The constructed R/NR discriminative model could improve the ability of IMERG for detecting the precipitation occurrence, with a classification accuracy of about 86.5\% and the equitable threat score (ETS) increased from 0.15 to 0.58. Further analyses showed that the proposed PBCF was more efficient than the cumulative distribution function mapping method in correcting IMERG. This study provides a novel insight for the correction of daily SPPs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Anthropogenic Environmental Drivers Of Antimicrobial Resistance In Wildlife
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - The isolation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) from wildlife living adjacent to humans has led to the suggestion that such antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is anthropogenically driven by exposure to antimicrobials and ARB. However, ARB have also been detected in wildlife living in areas without interaction with humans. Here, we investigated patterns of resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from 408 wild bird and mammal faecal samples. AMR and multi-drug resistance (MDR) prevalence in wildlife samples differed significantly between a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP; wastes of antibiotic-treated humans) and a Farm site (antibiotic-treated livestock wastes) and Central site (no sources of wastes containing anthropogenic AMR or antimicrobials), but patterns of resistance also varied significantly over time and between mammals and birds. Over 30% of AMR isolates were resistant to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic, but resistance was not due to the mcr-1 gene. ESBL and AmpC activity were common in isolates from mammals. Wildlife were, therefore, harbouring resistance of clinical relevance. AMR E. coli, including MDR, were found in diverse wildlife species, and the patterns and prevalence of resistance were not consistently associated with site and therefore different exposure risks. We conclude that AMR in commensal bacteria of wildlife is not driven simply by anthropogenic factors, and, in practical terms, this may limit the utility of wildlife as sentinels of spatial variation in the transmission of environmental AMR. © 2018

TI  - Mapping Fine-Scale Human Disturbances In A Working Landscape With Landsat Time Series On Google Earth Engine
JO  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Large fractions of human-altered lands are working landscapes where people and nature interact to balance social, economic, and ecological needs. Achieving these sustainability goals requires tracking human footprints and landscape disturbance at fine scales over time-an effort facilitated by remote sensing but still under development. Here, we report a satellite time-series analysis approach to detecting fine-scale human disturbances in an Ohio watershed dominated by forests and pastures but with diverse small-scale industrial activities such as hydraulic fracturing (HF) and surface mining. We leveraged Google Earth Engine to stack decades of Landsat images and explored the effectiveness of a fuzzy change detection algorithm called the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality, and Trend (BEAST) to capture fine-scale disturbances. BEAST is an ensemble method, capable of estimating changepoints probabilistically and identifying sub-pixel disturbances. We found the algorithm can successfully capture the patterns and timings of small-scale disturbances, such as grazing, agriculture management, coal mining, HF, and right-of-ways for gas and power lines, many of which were not captured in the annual land cover maps from Cropland Data Layers-one of the most widely used classification-based land dynamics products in the US. For example, BEAST could detect the initial HF wellpad construction within 60 days of the registered drilling dates on 88.2\% of the sites. The wellpad footprints were small, disturbing only 0.24\% of the watershed in area, which was dwarfed by other activities (e.g., right-of-ways of utility transmission lines). Together, these known activities have disturbed 9.7\% of the watershed from the year 2000 to 2017 with evergeen forests being the most affected land cover. This study provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness and reliability of BEAST for changepoint detection as well as its capability to detect disturbances from satellite images at sub-pixel levels and also documents the value of Google Earth Engine and satellite time-series imaging for monitoring human activities in complex working landscapes.

TI  - Integrated Wildfire Risk Assessment Of Natural And Anthropogenic Ecosystems Based On Simulation Modeling And Remotely Sensed Data Fusion
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Even though wildfires constitute a natural phenomenon, fires of high intensity may provoke profound ecological and socioeconomic implications. Primary aim of the paper constitutes the integrated wildfire risk assessment of a fire-prone region in Greece through the simulation modeling of burn probability (BP) and fire intensity to natural and anthropogenic resources (forests, birds' habitats, built-up areas, agricultural fields, energy networks etc.), as well as the identification of resources response to fires of differentiated intensity. So, fire modeling constitutes the primary input to wildfire effects determination through the contribution of fire and resources specialists. The predicted fire effects were quantified and mapped through a spatial index of Net Value Change which aggregates the total predicted change in terms of area gained (e. g. forest regeneration) or lost due to fire impacts. The greatest loss from the total area of each resource/asset was predicted to electricity and renewable energy sources networks (-0.48\%), followed by mixed forests (-0.47\%), residential buildings and assets (-0.43\%), coniferous forests (-0.43\%), shrubs (-0.4\%), broad-leaved forests (-0.27\%) and agricultural crops (-0.19\%). The mapping of this index demonstrated that the resources which are at high risk are located close to compact flammable material, following the pattern of increased fire intensity and BP. Hence, this framework can strategically and operationally be used to establish a hierarchical priority-based model for optimal allocation of fire resources. This two-stage of analysis allows for an objective quantification of fire effects to a spatial level (i.e. prefecture) where many biophysical attributes might heavily affect the fire modeling outcomes enhancing the credibility of results.

TI  - Application Of Remotely Sensed Sea Surface Temperature For Assessment Of Recurrent Coral Bleaching (2014–2019) Impact On A Marginal Coral Ecosystem
JO  - Geocarto International
PY  - 2022
AB  - The 2014–2016 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused a prolonged marine heatwave that led to widespread coral bleaching and mortality across the Indo-pacific coral reefs. Prediction of coral bleaching and assessment of bleaching impact on corals is vital for reef ecosystem functioning, services and management. Wherein, advanced satellite remote sensing approach to determine and quantify the thermal stress on corals can assist as an alternative and convenient tool for reef monitoring programs. The present study examines the impact of consecutive coral bleaching episodes on shallow-water marginalized patch reef ecosystems on the Eastern Arabian Sea. Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch’s (NOAA-CRW) platform, known as CoralTemp, were used to analyze the thermal stress on the coral reefs. Coral bleaching indices like Bleaching Threshold (BT), Positive Anomaly (PA), and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) were calculated. Ground-truthing revealed that detected thermal stress from satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data over this region well corroborate with the mass coral bleaching events, and found reliable for detecting coral bleaching episodes in the marginalized turbid coral habitats. This study signifies the potential benefit of incorporating remote sensed SST data in coral bleaching monitoring program, which may guide to undertake targeted coral surveys and aid in decision-making and conservation of the vulnerable coral reef ecosystems. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Spatialization And Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Energy Consumption Carbon Emissions In China
JO  - Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science
PY  - 2022
AB  - The adverse effects of global climate change on human production and life are becoming increasingly prominent. Responding to climate change has become a severe challenge faced by human society, and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has gradually become a common action by all countries. Therefore, analyzing carbon emissions through scientific methods has become an important foundation for responding to the national “dual carbon” strategy. This study used provincial-level carbon emission statistics, combined with nighttime light data and population data, and assigned carbon emissions to the grid scale. It also analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics and evolution characteristics of carbon emissions in China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, as well as the correlation between carbon emissions and the economy. The results showed that: ① from 2000 to 2018, the total CO2 emissions in China continued to grow, but the growth rate slowed over time. The average annual growth rate of carbon emissions dropped from 9. 9% in 2000-2010 to 7. 4% in 2010-2018. From the perspective of spatial distribution, carbon-free areas were mainly distributed in the northwest uninhabited area and northeast forest and mountainous areas, low-carbon emissions were mainly distributed in the vast small and medium-sized cities and towns, and high-carbon emissions were concentrated in northern, central, eastern coastal, and western provincial capitals and urban agglomerations. ② Carbon emissions had high-value or low-value agglomerations at prefecture-level cities; this agglomeration tended to stabilize as a whole and had strengthened after 2005. Low-low agglomeration areas were mainly distributed in the western contiguous areas and Hainan Island. With economic and social development, low-low agglomeration areas began to fragment and reduce in size; high-high agglomeration areas were mainly distributed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, Taiyuan urban agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations, and Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations, and the scale was gradually strengthened and consolidated; high-low and low-high agglomeration areas mainly appeared in neighboring cities with large differences in economic development levels. ③ Carbon emissions in most parts of China were relatively stable. The areas where carbon emissions had changed were mainly distributed in the peripheral areas of provincial capitals and key cities, and there was a circle structure with no changes in the central urban area and changes in carbon emissions in the peripheral areas. ④ The overall process of urban development in China from 2000 to 2018 followed a shift from “low emission-low income” to “high emission-low income” to “high emission-high income” and finally to “low emission-high income.” The growth rate of carbon emissions in China is slowing down. Under the background of the “dual carbon” strategy, different regions face different carbon emission reduction tasks and pressures due to different carbon emission situations. Therefore, the differentiated carbon emissions policy should be implemented by regions and industries. © 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Performance Evaluation Of China?S Photovoltaic Poverty Alleviation Project Using Machine Learning And Satellite Images
JO  - UTILITIES POLICY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Photovoltaic poverty alleviation project (PPAP) is one of China's essential targeted poverty alleviation projects. This study proposes a machine learning model and uses satellite images to evaluate the performance of PPAP in China. The trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with transfer learning was first used to identify the scale of photovoltaic (PV) power stations. Then the PV power capacity for poverty alleviation and carbon emission mitigation were estimated. The results identified 38 large-scale centralized and approximately 5,063,293 m2PV power stations built in Jinzhai County, Anhui province, China, by November 2020. The main findings are as follows. (1) The power generation and carbon mitigation of PPAP in Jinzhai County is about 1.8 x 103 MWh and 1.389 Mt per year. (2) The PPAP in Jinzhai County can recover the total costs and get benefits within three years, at least after completion. (3) Dynamic subsidy policy is needed to prevent over-scale or excessive government investment in PPAP. (4) The utilization of PPAP needs to be strengthened to transform the current "blood transfusion type" of poverty alleviation that relies more on government subsidies into more sustainable "hematopoietic style" poverty alleviation. This study is of significance to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate the performance of PPAP and give better utilize the role of renewable energy in promoting energy conservation, carbon emission reduction, and economic development.

TI  - Monitoring Covid-19 Where Capacity For Testing Is Limited: Use Of A Three-Step Analysis Based On Test Positivity Ratio
JO  - WHO South-East Asia journal of public health
PY  - 2020
AB  - In an effort to monitor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries have been calculating the ratio of cases confirmed to tests performed (test positivity ratio - TPR). While inferior to sentinel surveillance, TPR has the benefit of being easily calculated using readily available data; however, interpreting TPR and its trends can be complex because both the numerator and the denominator are constantly changing. We describe a three-step process where the ratio of relative increase in cases to relative increase in tests is accounted for in an adjusted TPR. This adjusted value more appropriately reflects the case number and factors out the effect of changes in the number of tests done. Unadjusted and adjusted TPRs are then assessed step-wise with reference to the epidemic curve and the cumulative numbers of cases and tests. Use of this three-step analysis and its potential use in guiding public health interventions are demonstrated for selected countries and subnational areas of the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region, together with the Republic of Korea as a reference. To date, application of the three-step analysis to data from countries of the region has signalled potential inadequacies of testing strategies. Further work is needed on approaches to support countries where testing capacity is likely to remain constrained. One example would be enumeration of the average number of tests needed to detect one COVID-19 case, which could be stratified by factors such as location and population. Such data would allow evidence-informed strategies that best balance the highest detection rate with the prevailing testing capacity.

TI  - Using Remotely Sensed Suspended Sediment Concentration Variation To Improve Management Of Poyang Lake, China
JO  - LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2013
AB  - This study applied Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2000 to 2010 to obtain and analyze the spatiotemporal variation of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discussed factors affecting it in Poyang Lake, China. Results showed that (1) the mean SSC was lower in the south, higher in the north, and moderate in the central lake region; (2) the mean SSC in the south was lower than or close to 20mg/L, with no clear annual trend; (3) the mean SSC in the north was slightly higher than 20mg/L in 2000 and increased from 2001, with the highest value >60mg/L in 2006; (4) the mean SSC in the central lake region, except for 2009, ranged from 20 to 40mg/L and had an annual pattern similar to that in the southern lake region; (5) for the entire lake, the mean SSC declined from January to March, increased from September to December, and fluctuated from April to August; and (6) several higher SSC values were found in the central or southern lake regions. The spatiotemporal variation of SSC was controlled by natural and human factors, in which dredging was dominant. Limiting the area of dredging and reducing dredging intensity would decrease SSC and maintain sustainable development of Poyang Lake. Remote sensing can obtain the spatiotemporal information of some water quality parameters, which will help managers understand the lake dynamics and mechanisms to make better decisions for lake management.

TI  - Satellite Data Analytics For Natural Disaster Assessment & Application To Pipeline Safety
JO  - Proceedings of the Biennial International Pipeline Conference, IPC
PY  - 2018
AB  - Understanding where, when, and how conditions are changing along the extent of an energy pipeline system, which can be vast, is a challenging task. The challenge can be even greater when natural disasters1 create a condition where access to affected pipelines, qualified personnel, and equipment is limited. To address these challenges, pipeline operators are working directly with experts in satellite technology to develop innovative applications incorporating the use of satellite technology and analytical processes to improve natural disaster monitoring and response. Through recent experiences following Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf Coast region of the United States in August-September 2017 and the wildfires and mudslides in Southern California that occurred in December 2017 to January 2018, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data was shown to be a useful tool for wide-area monitoring. Satellite-based SAR imagery has the unique advantage of penetrating through cloud cover and smoke and is capable of providing an early view of the extent of damage in both conditions. Satellite data and continuous improvements to their derived analytical products have resulted in significant benefits for pipeline operators preparing for and responding to the effects of potentially damaging natural processes, including river scour, erosion, avulsion, mudslides, and other threats to pipeline integrity and public safety. SAR change detection algorithms and processes can provide effective results in identifying areas affected by natural disasters that are not readily available by other means. These methods also provide timely information for allocating and directing resources to the most critical locations in support of post-disaster assessment and analysis. SAR satellite data and Amplitude Change Detection (ACD) algorithms provided the basis for confirming where flooding near pipeline infrastructure was most substantial following Hurricane Harvey. In the case of the Southern Californian forest fires and mudslides in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, recent investigations into ACD and Coherence Change Detection (CCD) algorithms showed promising results, providing a detailed view of damaged areas in near-real time. This paper describes the process of collecting, analyzing, and applying satellite data for assessing the impacts of natural disasters on pipeline infrastructure, and the methods applied, consisting primarily of multiple change detection algorithms, that are used to process the large volume of satellite archive images to extract relevant changes. This paper also describes how these tools and products were practically applied to support decisions by pipeline operators to protect and ensure the integrity and safety of pipelines in the affected areas.

AB  - Remote-sensing satellites are monitoring crop yields, oil and gas exploration, cartography, and forest management, yielding a wealth of useful information today. But in the future, higher quality images can bring an explosion of new applications, predicts US Representative George E. Brown, Jr, of California. Brown says that "high resolution civilian remote-sensing satellites would pose their greatest threat to closed - not open - societies.' He adds, "Bringing such images into the public domain for international scrutiny benefits the security of societies such as ours that are not constantly trying to hide their activities from the world.' The US Landsat program is currently "in a state of disarray,' Brown says. He advocates the launch of a state-of-the art satelite by the mid-1990s and a US policy "driven by the desires to turn this technology into a self-sustaining enterprise and to reap the maximum benefits that satelite imagery can provide.' -from Author

TI  - Application Of Remote Sensing Techniques To The Evaluation Of Water Consume
PY  - 1998
AB  - More than 80 \% of the total water consumption in Mediterranean countries is used for agricultural practices. When this water comes from subterranean reservoirs (aquifers), the evaluation of extracted volumes is very complex using the traditional methods. The exploitation of subterranean waters in Spain has become, in some cases, an environmental problem since it has affected highly valuable wetlands and river flows by depressing the water table levels. In this work, we introduce a methodology based on Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques that allows to evaluate the extracted water volumes for irrigation, with high accuracy levels and relatively low economic costs. The developed system is based on the elaboration of crop maps that are obtained from the analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images. The used procedure is a supervised classification of images that combines maximum likelihood algorithms and decision-tree criterions. The resulting data are integrated in a GIS and crossed with the values of water volumes needed per crop. The obtained output allows quantifying not only the spatial distribution of the water consumption, but also its evolution through time.

TI  - Land Use And Land Cover Dynamics And Ecosystem Services Values In Kewet District In The Central Dry Lowlands Of Ethiopia
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - A better comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the tempo-spatial dynamics of land use and cover (LULC) in the dry lowlands areas of Ethiopia is crucial for restoring degraded landscapes. This study aimed at analyzing the trends of LULC changes and determine their ecosystem service values in Kewet district central dry lowlands of Ethiopia using multi-temporal satellite imagery for three periods: 1995, 2008, and 2017. Supervised classification, using the maximum likelihood classifier, was applied to quantify LULC changes. Ecosystem Service values were estimated using the modified ecosystem service value coefficients. LULC analysis showed that cultivated land was the most predominant which covered over 41\% of the study area in all three periods. Forests showed a net increase of 18.2\%. Shrubland occupied the second largest portion in all LULC analysis next to cultivated land, and it showed a net decrease of 29.2\%. Open grassland showed a periodic increase. Over the past 20 years, built-up area and bared land grew continuously by 1.80 and 1.01 km(2) yr(-1), respectively. However, some degraded land was converted into woody vegetation land through area exclosure, which improved the vegetation coverage of the study area. Ecosystem Service values ranged from US\$ 2.37 million for shrubland in 1995 to US\$ 22.49 million for forest land in 2008. The total ESVs of the district also continuously decreased over the past two decades. Generally, the LULC in the Kewet district has been dynamic in that some of the LULC classes were expanding, while the others were shrinking through time.

AB  - Analyzing susceptibility provides the basis for risk prevention policies. The objective was to characterize the environmental conditions of Ilhéus that contribute to erosion processes. In addition to assessing the susceptibility of slope, geology, soi l, rainfall intensity, coverage, use and occupation factors and identifying areas at risk by creating a database containing classes and values of stability/ vulnerability to erosion. To develop the research it was necessary to collect bibliographic data; treatment of digital images for the map of slope, geology, soils, and land use, occupation and cover using geoprocessing techniques via GIS, in addition to average annual precipitation values (mm) and duration of the rainy season (months); it involved analysis based on the Crepani methodology (1996; 2001), the degree of stability of the environmental conditions, combined with the weights of the environmental conditions by the AHP Calculator (SAATY, 1991); creation of a multicriteria equation to generate the final map. The results indicate the characterization of the environmental constraints and their degree of stability, in addition to the areas of very high, high, average, low and very low vulnerability to erosion processes produced with the integration of the mappings. Average to very high vulnerability was obtained in 19% of the studied area, and very low to low vulnerability adds up to 82%. © 2023, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Index For Tracking Old-Growth Value In Disturbance-Prone Forest Landscapes
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forests in their later stages of development attain attributes that support biodiversity and provide a variety of ecological benefits (e.g. clean water and carbon storage). Despite their values, old-growth forests are declining worldwide in part due to anthropogenic pressures. A persistent challenge to managing and conserving old-growth forest has been establishing a reliable method for measuring old-growth values across large landscapes at an appropriately fine ecological and spatial scale. Using data from a community-managed forest in central British Columbia, Canada, an Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) based metric was developed, using a random forest modeling framework, to predict an old-growth index across the forest. Using this old-growth index, we estimated that forests with "Very-high" old-growth values cover 14.7\% of the study area (18,183.2 ha), and that only 25\% (4,545.9 ha) of this "very-high" old-growth value areas are current inside designated old-growth management areas (OGMAs). Additionally, the forests with "very-high" old-growth values that are currently inside OGMAs are fragmented, as only 1 out of 40 OGMAs have more than 50\% of its area covered by forests with "Very-high" old-growth value. This research provides a clear ecological indicator that uses fine-scale remotely sensed data to measure old-growth and assess its conservation status within reserves. While the index developed is specific to the study site, the framework, is generic enough to be adapted to other forest types and ecosystems. More importantly, the identification of the amount and location of old-growth forests over the landscape can aid in the management and conservation of this rare resource and its services.

TI  - Zonation And Spatiotemporal Evolution Of China's Desertification
JO  - Journal of Geo-Information Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Land desertification is one of the most serious eco- environmental problems in the world, and is among the top ten environmental and development problems that threaten the survival of human beings. China has severe desertification, and desertification has greatly affected China's eco- environment and social development. In this context, the research on desertification is of great significance to China. The evolution of desertification is mainly manifested in the change of desertification area, the area change, change of desertification types, vegetation change, and so on. In this paper, the 31 provincial regions of China (excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau) were included as the study area. Remote sensing was utilized to study the spatiotemporal evolution of the thematic factors of desertification, salinization, and erosion- induced desertification. Following the principles of regional differentiation, genesis, and multi- level sequences, China was divided into 8 desertification zones, 42 desertification sub- regions, and 36 desertification communities. Based on the desertified land type maps of 1975, 2000 and 2017, we analyzed the desertification evolution by focusing on the changes in the area and gravity center of China’s desertification. According to the percentage of increase or decrease of desertified land area over a certain period of time, the evolution types of desertification can be divided into 7 categories. The present study reveals the current situation of China’s desertification, and analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution and the gravity center movements of different desertification regions. Next, the key target areas and management suggestions of desertification control in China were discussed. Our findings are as follows. (1) There are many kinds of deserts and desertified lands in China, of which the area of severe desertification is 25.18×104 km2, accounting for 19.59% of the total desertification area. (2) From 1975 to 2017, China's desertification has been significantly reversed, and the dynamic characteristics of desertification in 1975- 2000 differed from 2000-2017. The intensity of desertification in 2000-2017 significantly reduced as compared to 1975-2000, thanks to the decrease in aggravated areas and increase in weakened areas. (3) The migration value of desertification center of gravity can indirectly reflect the development trend and degree of dynamic change of desertification, the greater the migration, the more significant the difference of desertification change in this region, and the direction of center of gravity migration is the area where desertification area increases. The coordinate migration of desertification barycenter points in different periods has the same orientation. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Specifying The Areas Suitable For Flood Spreading With The Approach Of Sustainable Development Of Groundwater Resources, Case Study: Sarkhoon Plain Of Hormozgan
JO  - Journal of Environmental Studies
PY  - 2016
AB  - Introduction: Increase in water demand will likely be followed by increased pressure on groundwater resources in the short term and long term. At this time, spreading floods on the aquifers is one of the appropriate methods to control and optimal use of floods and artificial recharge of groundwater resources in arid and semi-arid regions. Sarkhoon plain is one of the plains close to the center of Hormozgan Province where its groundwater has been supplying the regional needs for water, so far. A look at the hydrologic statistics of recent years indicates negative water balance in the plain. This reveals the importance of sustainable management of water in the region. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of factors effective in identifying the areas prone to artificial recharge in Sarkhoon plain by using network process analysis and determining appropriate areas for operations of artificial recharge using GIS in combination with the network process analysis. Thus, by identifying the areas prone to spreading floods and proposal for constructing structures, the wasting of water resources in the region will be prevented. Thus, some progress can be made in planning for sustainable development of water resources. Sarkhoon study area is located at almost 25 km from Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan Province, with an area about 11,400 ha. The estimated average annual rainfall values in the plains were 234 mm and 219 mm, respectively. The groundwater level changes in Sarkhoon plain during a period of 25 years from 1990-1991 to 2013-2014 accounted for 0.5 m of the annual drop. (pic 1) (Figure Presented) Materials and methods: In this study, 9 influencing factors of slope, water quality, water depth, permeability rate, alluvium thickness, land use, transferability, geomorphology and the drainage density were selected and analyzed. Then, the paired comparison method to determine the weight of classes of each layer and the ANP method were used to determine the final weight of the criteria. The Super Decision software was also used to determine the weights. After omission of the areas with limitation, the areas prone to flood spreading operation were determined. Hhe appropriate criteria for flood spreading operation in Sarkhoon Plain are: • Slope: To prepare the slope layer, the digital elevation model (DEM) with a pixel size of 30m is extracted from ASTER data. (pic 2) • Geomorphology: From the morphological map of the province, the study area was separated and divided into four classifications, (pic 2) • Water depth: Water depth map was obtained with minimum error using the 10-year average water levels data related to observation wells and generalization to the whole plain using interpolation algorithm by Kriging spherical model. (pic 2) • Alluvium thickness: The mentioned layer was re-classified into four classes, (pic 2) • Alluvium transferability: The water transferability map of Sarkhoon plain water was prepared according to the existing pumping test results of 10 Piezometers in the plain (Hormozgan Regional Water) with interpolation by Kriging spherical model in the ARCGIS 10 platform, (pic 2) • Land use: The land-use layer for the study area was obtained from 1:25000 maps and updated by using ASTER satellite images combined with bands 1, 2, 3 as well as Google Earth images, and were classified into four categories, (pic 2) • Water quality: In this study, the data of observation wells were used to provide the electrical conductivity layer of Sarkhoon plain area, (pic 2) • Drainage density: The cumulative flow layer was extracted from regional DEM, and then, the channel density layer was obtained. It was classified into six classes. (pic 2) • Permeability coefficient: To determine the permeability of the study area, the tests results provided by the Agricultural Research Center of Hormozgan province in 2009 were used, and the permeability layer was produced by interpolation. It was also re-classified into 5 categories. (Figure Presented) Identifying the areas with limitation In the present study according to research in this field and the region local conditions, three layers of slope, geomorphology and land use were identified as layers with limitations. Analytic network process (ANP) This model is one of the multi-criteria decision-making techniques classified in compensatory models series. The most important distinction between this method and the hierarchical approach is in the influence and effectiveness of criteria on one another. In this hierarchical structure model, a target or a node is initially located that finally ends to a destination node or cluster. Therefore, there is a linear structure from top to bottom and without returning from lower or higher levels. But in the network structure, the network and its clusters are not distributed on a regular basis. In addition, there should be the possibility of a cluster being influenced by itself (interdependence) or affecting another cluster (external dependency). Direct returning from the second cluster or passing through the middle cluster is possible. Results and discussion: Examination of the weights of criteria in this study indicated that the drainage density factor with a weight equal to 0.274 is the most important factor in locating of flood spreading in Sarkhoon Plain. After integration, the value of each cell was determined. To attain better results, using the natural breaks method, the whole land was divided into five final categories based on the zoning map. From the total area of Sarkhoon plain, about 14.2576 square kilometers and 45.0283 square kilometers were determined as very suitable and suitable areas, respectively, for flood spreading operation. The results indicate that most of the perfectly suitable and suitable areas occur in the category of 0-3% and 3-5% regarding the slope. Regarding the measure of depth, the perfectly suitable and suitable areas are located at depths greater than 68 meters. Also, these areas are in accordance with the ranges with higher transmissibility rates. Regarding thickness measure, the alluvium is located in a range greater than 60 m. Also, the zones are located in the areas with higher permeability coefficients (18-24 and 24> m per day). Regarding electrical conductivity layer, the suitable and perfectly suitable areas are located within the scope with EC less than 2000 micromhos/cm. In terms of land use layer, the lands are located in the areas with pasture usage and drainage density less than 3.8 km per square kilometers. Conclusion: Planning to use floods, meanwhile to reduce their destructive effects, will provide a new water source for the consumers. In the studies with similar research subject, the AHP method was used to determine the weights of criteria in such method. The criteria relations and their coefficient of impact are not considered to reduce the accuracy and quality of the work. Since the ANP method deals with the dependencies systematically, i.e., it considers all internal and external dependencies between the elements and clusters for analysis, but other methods consider these relationships. Thus, with the interdependence of environmental issues (including this study subject), the use of ANP method can provide the necessary supports for decision-makers and planners to solve water management issues to gain a deeper understanding of environmental issues.

TI  - Evaluating The Utility Of Camera Traps In Field Studies Of Predation
JO  - PEERJ
PY  - 2019
AB  - Artificial prey techniques-wherein synthetic replicas of real organisms are placed in natural habitats-are widely used to study predation in the field. We investigated the extent to which videography could provide additional information to such studies. As a part of studies on aposematism and mimicry of coral snakes (Micrurus) and their mimics, observational data from 109 artificial snake prey were collected from video-recording camera traps in three locations in the Americas (terra firme forest, Tiputini Biodiversity Station, Ecuador; premontane wet forest, Naha Reserve, Mexico; longleaf pine forest, Southeastern Coastal Plain, North Carolina, USA). During 1,536 camera days, a total of 268 observations of 20 putative snake predator species were recorded in the vicinity of artificial prey. Predators were observed to detect artificial prey 52 times, but only 21 attacks were recorded. Mammals were the most commonly recorded group of predators near replicas (243) and were responsible for most detections (48) and attacks (20). There was no difference between avian or mammalian predators in their probability of detecting replicas nor in their probability of attacking replicas after detecting them. Bite and beak marks left on clay replicas registered a higher ratio of avian:mammalian attacks than videos registered. Approximately 61.5\% of artificial prey monitored with cameras remained undetected by predators throughout the duration of the experiments. Observational data collected from videos could provide more robust inferences on the relative fitness of different prey phenotypes, predator behavior, and the relative contribution of different predator species to selection on prey. However, we estimate that the level of predator activity necessary for the benefit of additional information that videos provide to be worth their financial costs is achieved in fewer than 20\% of published artificial prey studies. Although we suggest future predation studies employing artificial prey to consider using videography as a tool to inspire new, more focused inquiry, the investment in camera traps is unlikely to be worth the expense for most artificial prey studies until the cost:benefit ratio decreases.

TI  - Evaluating The Utility Of High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Air Pollution Data In Estimating Local Pm2.5 Exposures In California From 2015–2018
JO  - Atmosphere
PY  - 2022
AB  - Air quality management is increasingly focused not only on across-the-board reductions in ambient pollution concentrations but also on identifying and remediating elevated exposures that often occur in traditionally disadvantaged communities. Remote sensing of ambient air pollution using data derived from satellites has the potential to better inform management decisions that address environmental disparities by providing increased spatial coverage, at high-spatial resolutions, compared to air pollution exposure estimates based on ground-based monitors alone. Daily PM2.5 estimates for 2015–2018 were estimated at a 1 km2 resolution, derived from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm in order to assess the utility of highly refined spatiotemporal air pollution data in 92 California cities and in the 13 communities included in the California Community Air Protection Program. The identification of pollution hot-spots within a city is typically not possible relying solely on the regulatory monitoring networks; however, day-to-day temporal variability was shown to be generally well represented by nearby ground-based monitoring data even in communities with strong spatial gradients in pollutant concentrations. An assessment of within-ZIP Code variability in pollution estimates indicates that high-resolution pollution estimates (i.e., 1 km2) are not always needed to identify spatial differences in exposure but become increasingly important for larger geographic areas (approximately 50 km2). Taken together, these findings can help inform strategies for use of remote sensing data for air quality management including the screening of locations with air pollution exposures that are not well represented by existing ground-based air pollution monitors. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis To Capture Socio-Economic Factors In Mangrove Conservation
JO  - MARINE POLICY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems, located in tropical and subtropical coastal waters and river estuaries. Mangroves benefit both people and the environment by providing shelter for brackish-water organisms, such as fish and shrimp. They form a green-belt area that protects land from abrasion and tsunamis, along with goods and services for people, e.g., fruit, fish and charcoal. However, unmanaged use of mangrove ecosystems has resulted in a widespread decline in their function and conflicts between users. A paucity of research on mangrove management and spatial zoning is also contributing to the decline of these ecosystems. This study develops a prioritisation process with Spatial Multi-criteria Analysis (SMCA) for social-ecological mangrove management, based on a case study in Baros, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We include social (participation and perception), demographic, economic (economic value of mangroves) and ecological criteria (water quality, mangrove density and diversity, phytoplankton diversity and density) criteria and spatial considerations informed by remote sensing imagery. We consider the three different conservation scenarios of habitat protection areas, sanctuary areas, and restricted areas to help configure management plan options. We demonstrate how SMCA can support managers and policymakers in mapping conservation areas based on complex and diverse social-ecological data. However, further discussion with stakeholders in Baros is required to validate the produced map for future use. The involvement of stakeholders and governing bodies from the beginning or within the SMCA analysis will always be crucial in community-based prioritisations.

AB  - Access to electricity is crucial for poverty reduction and economic growth. However, almost 759 million people still do not have access to electricity. More than 90% are located in the global South, where low-income countries struggle to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy sources to ameliorate the basic living standards. Even though there are many opportunities to provide basic electrification in these settings, the lack of reliable and updated information about electrification has become one of the main challenges for policymakers and developers to better plan grid extensions and prioritize communities with higher needs. The increasing availability of remote sensing data has created opportunities to obtain information about electricity access at a larger and quicker scale. Using ground truth data of 57k distribution transformer locations from Kenya, we present a processing pipeline to validate and compare state-of-the-art techniques that use very high resolution (VHR) daytime imagery (50cm Digital Globe) or low-resolution nightlight (NTL) imagery (450m VIIRS-DNB) to identify electricity access. Further, we propose a supervised-learning approach called PowerScour that outperforms three techniques from the commercial, scientific and public fields. By assessing the trade-offs between temporal and spatial resolution and comparing population and settlement patterns, we find that PowerScour improves the F1-score of existing techniques by up to ≈27% in deep rural areas. In Kenya, our model correctly identified ≈73.4% of places with and without access to electricity between 2013 and 2017.

TI  - Satellites To Sprinklers: Assessing The Role Of Climate And Land Cover Change On Patterns Of Urban Outdoor Water Use
JO  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Outdoor water use represents over 50\% of total water demand in semiarid and arid cities and presents both challenges to and opportunities for improved efficiency and water resilience. The current work adapts a remote sensing-based methodology to estimate growing season irrigation rates at the census block group scale in Denver, Colorado. Results show that city-wide outdoor water use does not change significantly from 1995 to 2018, while per capita water use and total water use significantly decrease from 2000 to 2018. Because total water use, but not outdoor use, is decreasing, the percent of water used outdoors significantly increases across the city from 2000 to 2018. Climate variables account for one-quarter of interannual variation in mean irrigation rates due primarily to changes in temperature, not precipitation. Percent impervious land cover exhibits a significant inverse nonlinear relationship with irrigation rates at the census block group scale. Finally, 38\% of Denver census block groups show significantly increasing irrigation rates between 1995 and 2018 driven primarily by increasing temperatures. The increasing proportion of water used for irrigation highlights the importance of outdoor demand management for urban water systems as indoor efficiencies improve. We advocate that resilient water systems necessitate integrated land use, infrastructure, and water planning in the face of urban growth and climate change. While minimizing irrigated urban areas may reduce demand, remaining green spaces should be designed to maximize multiple benefits including reductions in water demand and urban heat islands, stormwater management, and recreation to improve the sustainability of growing cities.

AB  - Objective. Satellite-based remote-sensing analysis is a beneficial, yet underused, tool for environmental policy, planning, and evaluation. We identify its benefits and costs to encourage social scientlists to consider the use of remote sensing as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutions. Methods. We analyze two multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images to evaluate a habitat conservation plan (HCP) implemented Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. Results, Image analysis provides useful broad spatial scale information on HCP performance that is not discernible to the naked eye or through other methodologies. Conclusions. Satellite image analysis should be considered as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutional designs-despite the financial costs and requisite technical training. These images provide ecological and land cover change information that may not be available elsewhere. We provide lessons learned to help make analysts cognizant of some important issues Surrounding the use of satellite-based imagery for environmental institutional analysis.

TI  - Applicability Analysis Of Gpm Satellite Precipitation Dataset In Nandu River Basin
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2022
AB  - In order to compare and analyze the accuracy and applicability of Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG) satellite precipitation products in Nandu River Basin, the daily precipitation data of 51 ground observation stations in Nandu River Basin from 2014 to 2018 is collected in this paper, and the evaluation index such as Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), relative bias (BIAS) and mean absolute error (MAE) are chosen to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of GPM IMERG satellite precipitation products, including Early Run, Late Run and Final Run, on daily and monthly scales. The results show that: (1) the correlation coefficient between the three types of GPM precipitation products and ground station observation dataset is significantly improved on the monthly scale compared with the daily scale. (2) It can be seen that the accuracy of the three types of GPM products is related to the number of data revisions. With the increase of the number of revisions, the accuracy of data continues to rise. In general, GPM precipitation products have high accuracy and applicability in Nandu River Basin. The results of this paper are expected to provide some support for the application of GPM IMERG satellite precipitation dataset in hydrological research and water resources management in Nandu River Basin, and have a certain reference value for the relevant research in other basins. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

JO  - JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Higher education literature identifies mistrust as one of the prominent features of managerialism. Similarly, multi-campus institutional studies have interrogated mistrust in various ways. However, there is limited research on academics' experiences of how mistrust relates to their understandings and values of their academic profession in multi-campus contexts. This article contributes knowledge to narrow this gap. It draws from a study that examined academics' experiences of how space enables or constrains their practices towards academic identity construction in an open distance learning institution in South Africa. A total of 12 academics who work on satellite campuses of the institution were interviewed. The social production of space framed the analysis. Findings indicate that a multi-campus institutional context aggravates mistrust and impinges on academics' interaction and prospects for development within a wider institutional space. Recommendations are made about how to reduce the influence of mistrust on academics' practices in multi-campus contexts.

AB  - The capitalization of agricultural production often takes place under price instability of final products. This provides the quantitative need to modify the resources allocated to the agricultural production process in order to obtain best economic values. More exactly, in a retroactive way, the economic optimum point will have different values for different times, corresponding to the variable price of capitalization of production. Specifically, this study presents an analysis of variance of necessary amount of nitrogen which must be optimally allocated according to a situation of instability in the price of wheat, for the interval of wheat price between 150 and 300 Euro/tonne. Furthermore, several remarks are made on the size of differences obtained. Different values obtained were characterized by differences of up to 9,7% on mentioned interval; they have significant implications for economic considerations; more important, the differences can also be approached from environmental reasons, regarding the negative impact of allocation of unjustified high amounts of chemicals. © SGEM2014.

TI  - Geo-Spatial Analysis Of Drought In The Gambia Using Multiple Models
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climate change has made The Gambia vulnerable to drought hazard. Variability and negative trends in rainfall quantity and mid-season dry spells mainly attributed to the impacts of climate change. The inadequacy in hydrometeorological information puts the agricultural sector at a high risk which employs over 70\% of the population. The aim of this study was to establish the intensity and spatiotemporal pattern of drought in The Gambia from 2000 to 2020 using multiple drought indices. Rainfall data, satellite images, and government policy documents were analyzed to determine the state of drought in The Gambia. Rainfall data, using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Precipitation Anomaly Percentage (PAP) were calculated and interpolated, and satellite images were processed using Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) to determine drought intensity and spatial distribution. The findings revealed that drought exists in The Gambia at moderate levels of SPI values (- 1.00 to - 1.49), (35\% of PAP), and VCI of no drought intensity of more than 35\%. The most drought prone areas in The Gambia are North Bank Region and Eastern parts of country in both north and south of The Gambia River banks. Recommendations of adaptation practice both on-farm and off-farm such as damming and economic diversification was drawn from other parts of the world, to reduce the negative effects of drought hazard in The Gambia.

TI  - Integration Of Complete Water Quality Remote Monitoring Systems
JO  - Proceedings of the Annual ISA Analysis Division Symposium
PY  - 2005
AB  - The U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) has determined that the most vulnerable component of drinking water systems is the distribution system. A report released by the GAO on September 30, 2004, entitled, "Experts' Views on How Federal Funding Can Best Be Spent To Improve Securiry"(1), states that, "experts most strongly supported developing near real-time monitoring technologies to quickly detect contaminants in treated drinking water on its way to consumers". The integration of computing hardware, sensors, software, and communications is required to remotely monitor water quality in a distribution system. A complete integrated water quality remote monitoring system facilitates the detection and reporting of contamination with acquisition, analysis, management, and communication of data. The data consists of the values of physical and chemical parameters acquired by sensors in near real time. The sensors can be installed, in the piping under pressure, or in a side-stream monitoring configuration open to atmosphere. The selection of the sensor set depends on the application and the monitoring emphasis. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in December 2003, released the "Response Protocol Toolbox: Planning for and Responding to Drinking Water Contamination Threats and Incidents(2)." The USEPA suggests in this document, that a water quality baseline be created by monitoring a combination of traditional and non-traditional water quality parameters. A normal baseline can be determined by monitoring these parameters over time. Contamination will cause one or more of the parameters to change, significantly. The monitoring system will detect significant variations from normal values and notify of the evidence of contamination. Several factors should influence the selection of sensors: accuracy, reliability, power consumption, flexibility, maintenance required, and cost. Analysis and data management can be performed efficiently by distributing logic to the point of data acquisition. The data from the sensors is acquired by the logical device and analyzed for compliance with the baseline. The logical device should permit data to be stored for communication and management. The primary mission of any such system is to immediately notify appropriate personnel of any significant changes in water quality so personnel in charge can make decisions about any response. Utilities must be able to afford to buy the monitoring stations in quantity in order to provide the most coverage of any distribution system. Communication of the data can be through existing systems or by the utilization of new radio, cellular, satellite, Ethernet, and other networks. The systems may be able to be configured remotely in order to minimize maintenance. Copyright 2005 by ISA.

JO  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water temperature (Tw) is a primary determinant of river ecosystem health and function that is strongly controlled by climate variability and change but mediated by catchment properties. We apply a nested analysis to: (1) evaluate how annual and seasonal mean Tw varied across England during the period 2000-2018; (2) assess the extent to which these regional-temporal dynamics correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); and (3) quantify the impact of local climate variability on modelled daily maximum Tw for open, shaded and spring-fed river reaches. Such information is used to identify sentinel locations for long-term monitoring and reporting, to evaluate the true benefit of riparian shade management, and to assess the impacts of climate change on Tw. We draw on a national archive of nearly 1 million Tw values and data from a high resolution field experiment in central England. Nationally, annual mean Tw changed by-0.4 degrees C/ decade over the period 2000 to 2018, broadly in line with Central England Temperatures, although summer Tw changed by +0.6 to +1.1 degrees C/decade in parts of central and northern England. There were significant associations between summer Tw and NAO (rho = 0.64, p < 0.05), especially at sites above 300 m altitude (rho = 0.70, p < 0.01). The regional analysis reveals strongest links between summer Tw and NAO in northeast England and weakest associations in lowland regions of southern and east England with major aquifers. Hence, places with significant groundwater flows offer the greatest chance of detecting long-term signals in Tw that are not being driven by the NAO. Site-specific, logistic regression models of daily maximum Tw are found to be sensitive to the prevailing NAO phase during calibration periods. Such models show a thermal benefit for shaded sites compared with open sites that is one average 0.2 degrees C under negative NAO but 2.8 degrees C under positive NAO. Based on the findings from our nested analysis we suggest ways of optimising monitoring networks plus improving the appraisal of measures intended to keep rivers cool. In particular, we call for the creation of a national indicator of Tw for use in UK Climate Change Risk Assessments.

TI  - Long-Term Runoff Dynamics Assessment Measured Through Land Use/Cover (Lulc) Changes In A Tropical Complex Catchment
JO  - Environment Systems and Decisions
PY  - 2019
AB  - The estimation of excess rainfall is critically important in water resource management as it provides the basis for calculating flood peak discharge that results in surface runoff. Kelantan River basin in Malaysia is a tropical catchment receiving heavy monsoon rainfall coupled with intense land use/cover (LULC) changes making the area consistently flood prone. The current study is therefore aimed to achieve the following goals: (1) to develop a curve number (CN) and runoff maps for 1984, 2002, and 2013 LULC conditions and (2) to determine runoff dynamics due to changes in LULC as well as to assess how the extent of LULC change will affect surface runoff generation. To achieve the aforementioned goals, land use maps corresponding to 1984, 2002, and 2014 LULC conditions were analyzed and prepared for the calculation of CN values using Soil Conservation Service (SCS-CN) method. CN and runoff maps corresponding to 1984, 2002, and 2013 LULC changes were successfully developed and the performance of the method was tested. The results indicated that forest was found to be the major land use type to have changed in all the LULC conditions across the watershed leading to intense runoff dynamics in the entire watershed. Higher runoff values were observed under 2013 LULC conditions across the watershed mainly due to intense deforestation relative to those of 1984 and 2002. The results of this study indicated that runoff generation is significantly affected by deforestation instead of changes in the rainfall pattern. The findings may be useful to water resource planners in controlling water loss for future planning. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Urban Land Use And Land Cover Change Analysis Using Random Forest Classification Of Landsat Time Series
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Efficient implementation of remote sensing image classification can facilitate the extraction of spatiotemporal information for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. Mapping LULC change can pave the way to investigate the impacts of different socioeconomic and environmental factors on the Earth’s surface. This study presents an algorithm that uses Landsat time-series data to analyze LULC change. We applied the Random Forest (RF) classifier, a robust classification method, in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 as inputs for the 1985 to 2019 period. We also explored the performance of the pan-sharpening algorithm on Landsat bands besides the impact of different image compositions to produce a high-quality LULC map. We used a statistical pan-sharpening algorithm to increase multispectral Landsat bands’ (Landsat 7–9) spatial resolution from 30 m to 15 m. In addition, we checked the impact of different image compositions based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data such as digital elevation model (DEM) and land surface temperature (LST) on final classification accuracy based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data on final classification accuracy. We compared the classification result of our proposed method and the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLCL) map to verify the algorithm. The results show that: (1) Using pan-sharpened top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Landsat products can produce more accurate results for classification instead of using surface reflectance (SR) alone; (2) LST and DEM are essential features in classification, and using them can increase final accuracy; (3) the proposed algorithm produced higher accuracy (94.438% overall accuracy (OA), 0.93 for Kappa, and 0.93 for F1-score) than CGLCL map (84.4% OA, 0.79 for Kappa, and 0.50 for F1-score) in 2019; (4) the total agreement between the classification results and the test data exceeds 90% (93.37–97.6%), 0.9 (0.91–0.96), and 0.85 (0.86–0.95) for OA, Kappa values, and F1-score, respectively, which is acceptable in both overall and Kappa accuracy. Moreover, we provide a code repository that allows classifying Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 within GEE. This method can be quickly and easily applied to other regions of interest for LULC mapping. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Freezing Rain And Snow Disaster In The South Of China And Its Snow Cover Monitoring
JO  - Journal of Natural Disasters
PY  - 2010
AB  - A rarely severe cryogenic freezing rain and snow disaster occurred in widespread southern China from January to early February in 2008. According to the thermosonde curves, it appears that the mechanism of freezingrain in the eastern China is different from that in mid-western Guizhou with high-altitude. Most snow cover in the low - latitude southern China is thin and wet. A little liquid water in snow could sharply raise the microwave brightness temperature, therefore change the radiation signal. Based on the variation of brightness temperature value between day and night during snow freezing - thawing process in southern China, a compensating way of snow monitoring in lower latitude was built by using the passive microwave data (DMSP - SSM/I), which combined with other snow remote sense products could offer more information about snow distribution.

TI  - Impact Of National Schistosomiasis Control Program In Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt: An Independent Evaluation
JO  - The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association
PY  - 1998
AB  - A longitudinal study has been conducted (1991-1997) to evaluate the impact of repeated selective chemotherapy on human transmission indices of Schistosoma mansoni infection. The study population included 8370 individuals inhabiting four villages and their satellites and representing high and low S. mansoni endemicity communities in Kafr EI-Sheikh governorate. A parasitological survey was conducted for three successive years (1991-1992 and 1993). Each time infected received praziquantel (PZQ) chemotherapy. In 1997, a fourth parasitological survey was done. During the period from 1994-1996 only routine diagnosis and treatment of schistosomiasis offered by the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) was going on. Study results revealed a decrease in S. mansoni prevalence and intensity of infection in the first three years. The drop was marked after the first year. In 1997, after the cessation of active case finding and treatment by the project team, an upward trend was observed for both prevalence and geometric mean egg count (GMEC) especially for the high prevalence villages. However, all indices were kept at significant low levels as compared to base-line values in 1991.

TI  - Effect Of Oil Palm Sustainability Certification On Deforestation And Fire In Indonesia
JO  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
PY  - 2018
AB  - Many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase or produce only “sustainable” palm oil, a commodity responsible for substantial tropical forest loss. Sustainability certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (∼188,000 km2) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. While forest loss and fire continued after RSPO certification, certified palm oil was associated with reduced deforestation. Certification lowered deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, by 2015, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within Indonesian oil palm plantations. Moreover, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

TI  - Safe Introduction Of New Procedures And Emerging Technologies In Surgery: Education, Credentialing, And Privileging (Reprinted From Surgical Oncology Clinics Of North America, January 2007, Pp. 101-14)
JO  - SURGICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
PY  - 2007
AB  - Advances in science and technology have led to modifications in established procedures and introduction of entirely new procedures and technologies in surgery. Such advances continue to impact surgical practice. Patients benefit from the advances through access to more safe and effective treatment modalities or enhancement of quality of life. Unless concrete steps are taken to ensure safe introduction of a new procedure or technology into surgical practice, however, patients may be placed at undue risk. A surgeon's decision to adopt a new procedure or technology may be influenced by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These include the desire to provide the best care to patients, the lure of the procedure or technology, the drive to remain competitive, or pressures from health care systems, industry, and even the patients themselves {[}1]. Self-regulation by surgeons, individually and collectively as a profession, remains key to ensuring patient safety. This requires the highest levels of professionalism. Unless the surgical profession regulates itself diligently and demonstrates transparency in this process, external regulatory bodies and the government may get involved {[}2]. Introduction of new procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, carotid stent placement, and total mesorectal excision into surgical practice has demonstrated the need for several key steps. These include objectively assessing the new procedure or emerging technology using evidence-based information, offering educational interventions to help surgeons acquire the requisite knowledge and skills, supporting safe and effective introduction of new surgical modalities into practice, monitoring of outcomes, credentialing and privileging of surgeons and surgical teams, and educating patients.

TI  - Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images To Explore The Spatial Relationship Between Landscape Patterns And Ecosystem Service Values In Regions Of Urbanization
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has substantially changed landscape patterns and seriously disturbed the structure and function of the ecosystems. However, the spatial characteristics and relationships between landscape patterns and ecosystem service values (ESVs) along the urban-rural gradient remain unclear. Based on high-resolution images, this study used concentric buffer zones to explore the characteristics and relationship between landscape pattern indexes (LPIs) and ESVs in the rural-urban gradient to reveal the impact of urban development on urban ecosystems. The results showed that the landscape heterogeneity was high in the urban fringe 18-20 km from the urban center. The PD, ED, LSI, SHAPE\_MN, DIVISION, SPLIT, and SHIDI variables had the lowest values in the urban center, while CONTAG and AI had the high values in the urban. Water bodies and forest land are the main land use/land cover (LULC) types that provide ecosystem services. The total ESV of Kunshan city totaled 5597.31 x 10(6) CNY in 2018. The average ESV increased from 2.42 x 10(6) CNY to 9.92 x 10(6) CNY along the urban-rural gradient, which indicated that natural landscapes had higher ESVs. ED and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) had positive effects on ESV, while Largest Patch Index (LPI), Contagion (CONTAG), Proportion of Like Adjacencies (PLADJ), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), and Aggregation Index (AI) had negative effects on ESV. The results of the regression model indicated there were quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs, which revealed how landscape pattern affected ESVs. The study can provide a scientific reference for the optimization of urban landscape patterns and urban and rural sustainable development.

TI  - Extraction Of Vegetation Coverage And Analysis Of Landscape Pattern In Rare Earth Mining Area Based On Landsat Image
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2016
AB  - Mining rare earth ore has brought vegetation degradation, serious ecological and environmental problems in mining area, and it has already received more and more attentions and concerns by the society. By using 23 years Landsat series remote sensing images as data source, and choosing Lingbei rare earth mining area in Dingnan County as study area, in this paper, we analyzed the change of vegetation coverage of landscape pattern under the disturbance of rare earth mining. In order to improve the reliability of analyzing landscape pattern, the vegetation coverage of study area was extracted with four methods of forest canopy density mapping model (FCD), dimidiate pixel model (DPM), three-endmember and four-endmember linear spectral mixture model (LSMM). Taking vegetation coverage of the studied area acquired from the high-spatial-resolution remote sensing image of Pleiades as the checking data, the most suitable method of vegetation coverage in rare earth mining area was selected. And the change of landscape pattern was analyzed with this method. In addition, to prove the universality of this method, vegetation coverage of Heling rare earth mining area in Xunwu County was also extracted with methods of FCD model, DPM and three-endmember LSMM. In the test, we selected randomly 30 samples from a 0.5 meter high-spatial-resolution aerial image as the checking data. The result showed that the correlation coefficients of FCD model, DPM, three-endmember and four-endmember LSMM were 0.9008, 0.9247, 0.9804 and 0.9465, respectively. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of FCD model, DPM, three-endmember and four-endmember LSMM were 0.3411, 0.2434, 0.0378 and 0.0893, respectivley. Similar results were obtained from the Heling rare earth mining area in Xunwu County. These two parameters of the correlation coefficients and RMSE could clearly show that the three-endmember LSMM was more suitable and accuracy for the extraction of vegetation coverage due to considering the spectral characteristics of peculiar tail sand in rare earth mining area. The landscape pattern dynamic analysis showed that fragmentation of low-level vegetation coverage and high-level vegetation coverage was at the low level in the mining area, concentrated and connected trend was obvious. And patch density (PD) value of the other three levels' vegetation coverage were higher, they existed some ecological risks. The Largest Patch Index (LPI) of low-level vegetation coverage was relatively large in four years, and showed the fluctuating change. The area was mainly constituted by the bare of rare occurrences, and it had close relationship between ore occurrences' reclamation and expanding. When LPI reached 0.543 6 and its area was 1 km2 in 2013, vegetation destruction caused by an individual mine was still larger. When the LPI of high-level vegetation coverage had a more dramatic change, and it reached the maximum of 80.5190 in 2008, the area of high-level vegetation coverage increased in patches of ways due to people strengthened on ecological governance of rare earth mining area. When around small patches of low-level vegetation coverage gradually transformed into high-level vegetation coverage, high-level vegetation coverage patches became the entire mining matrix patches. The Aggregation Index (AI) of low-level vegetation coverage was consistently high, and its LPI was lower than high-level vegetation coverage. When the ionic rare earth was mined mainly in individual occurrence of small area, and ore occurrences were many and dispersed, this led environmental damage that were more difficult to control. After year 1999, with the scale expansion of mining and its process improvement, rare earth mining became the main cause for mining area's landscape change. On the premise of overall improvement of ecological environment in mining area, the low-level vegetation coverage area concentrated in the ore occurrences and surrounding ore occurrences become landscape distribution pattern with rare earth mining area features of ore occurrences. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Spatial Modelling Of Groundwater Quality Across A Land Use And Land Cover Gradient In Limpopo Province, South Africa
JO  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
PY  - 2020
AB  - The spatial variability of groundwater quality in rural Mokopane District is investigated. This was achieved by evaluating the variability in groundwater physio-chemical parameters in relation to Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)using Kriging geo-statistical technique and key groundwater physio-chemical parameters namely; ammonia, lead, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), nitrates and chloride. Firstly, we derived the LULC from 30-m Landsat 8-OLI satellite data, with an overall accuracy of 76.67\%. Water quality parameters were modelled in geographic information systems using the kriging interpolation technique. We then compared measured water quality and the drinking standards recommended by the South African Water Quality Standards (SAWS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline standards for drinking water. Results indicated that there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the levels of physio-chemical contents between borehole water and standard values according to the SAWS and WHO. For example, TDS in Mosesetjane exceeded both SAWS and WHO drinking water levels. Nitrate concentrations were also high on the first and second quarter with concentration levels of 5.56-29 mg/l and 30.9 mg/l in Mosesetjane, respectively. However, lead and ammonia were found to be evenly distributed in all the four quarters, but exhibited some slight deviations from the standard levels (+/- 4.7 mg/l) in selected quarters. Results also indicated significant differences in TDS, chloride and nitrate concentrations across different LULC types. Subsistence farming and built-up areas were the main LULC types that were found to have high concentrations of TDS, ammonia and nitrates, exceeding the recommended standards. However, lead and ammonia, did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) and these parameters were fairly distributed, with less spatial variability. The second quarter, extending between October and December, and the fourth quarter, extending from April to June, exhibited high concentrations of nitrates, chloride and TDS during the wet season. On the other hand, the first and third quarter of the dry period were associated with low concentrations. This study indicated that LULC types and seasonal variability have influence on specific groundwater quality parameters.

TI  - Green Area And Vegetation Cover Indexes For Parral City (Chile) Using Photointerpretation And Gis
JO  - Ciencia Florestal
PY  - 2011
AB  - The importance of the green areas is increasing since they are an important factor in the health and welfare of urban population. Therefore, in Parral city, in Central Chile, it was quantified and analyzed the availability of green areas and vegetation cover, using aerial photographs scale 1:10000 and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In a first stage, urban street trees were quantified through a simple random sample of twenty four units with field measurements combined with measurements on aerial photographs, from which it was obtained the surface provided. Subsequently, through the creation of GIS layers, the surface of existing green areas and available open spaces were obtained. In addition, through supervised digital classification, the surface covered by urban forestry in private spaces was calculated. Quantity indexes show that Parral city currently has 12.72 ha of green areas, equivalent to 4.82 m 2/hab, which implies a green area frequency of 0.022 m 2/m 2. These values could be improved, if the available open space are incorporated and thereby reach 12.06 m 2 per inhabitant. In relation with availability indexes it was established that the average of accessibility to a green area is 327.2 m. Moreover, assuming a buffer of 200 m around the green areas, it was determined that there are 5160 houses with the basic service (56.4%). By incorporating the available open spaces, these values decrease significantly obtaining an average of accessibility to a green area of 213.7 m and coverage of basic service of 79.2%. Finally, it was estimated that the existing vegetation within the urban blocks (urban forest in private spaces) represents an important resource 17.8 times larger than urban street trees, so it should be considered within the municipal plans and policies.

TI  - Critical Analysis Of Urban Vegetation Mapping By Satellite Multispectral And Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery
PY  - 2019
AB  - The monitoring and management of urban vegetation is an important issue nowadays due to the multiple benefits of vegetation for people well-being and for maintaining the balance of ecosystem. In that context, the following study explore to what extent remote sensing imagery could be used to detect and to characterize urban vegetation. Two types of imagery were tested which are low-resolution satellite (i.e. Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 OLI) and high resolution airborne (i.e. Rikola hyperspectral sensor), the study assessed the detectability of vegetation species over Kaunas city (Lithuania) for different seasonal acquisitions. Satellite imagery showed accurate detection of 3 coarse classes of vegetation with overall accuracies (O.A.) superior to 90\%, and airborne hyperspectral imagery showed decent detection of 13 fine classes of vegetation with O.A. of up to 73\%.

TI  - Ocean Surface Partitioning Strategies Using Ocean Colour Remote Sensing: A Review
JO  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
PY  - 2017
AB  - The ocean surface is organized into regions with distinct properties reflecting the complexity of interactions between environmental forcing and biological responses. The delineation of these functional units, each with unique, homogeneous properties and underlying ecosystem structure and dynamics, can be defined as ocean surface partitioning. The main purposes and applications of ocean partitioning include the evaluation of particular marine environments; generation of more accurate satellite ocean colour products; assimilation of data into biogeochemical and climate models; and establishment of ecosystem-based management practices. This paper reviews the diverse approaches implemented for ocean surface partition into functional units, using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) data, including their purposes, criteria, methods and scales. OCRS offers a synoptic, high spatial-temporal resolution, multi-decadal coverage of bio-optical properties, relevant to the applications and value of ocean surface partitioning. In combination with other biotic and/or abiotic data, OCRS-derived data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, optical properties) provide a broad and varied source of information that can be analysed using different delineation methods derived from subjective, expert-based to unsupervised learning approaches (e.g., cluster, fuzzy and empirical orthogonal function analyses). Partition schemes are applied at global to mesoscale spatial coverage, with static (time-invariant) or dynamic (time-varying) representations. A case study, the highly heterogeneous area off SW Iberian Peninsula (NE Atlantic), illustrates how the selection of spatial coverage and temporal representation affects the discrimination of distinct environmental drivers of phytoplankton variability. Advances in operational oceanography and in the subject area of satellite ocean colour, including development of new sensors, algorithms and products, are among the potential benefits from extended use, scope and applications of ocean surface partitioning using OCRS.

TI  - Larus Relictus Habitat Hierarchical Evaluation Based On A Data Driven Approach
JO  - Environmental Engineering and Management Journal
PY  - 2021
AB  - The application of Species Distribution Models (SDM) in the management of species habitat and environmental impact changes has been widely used by scientists and ecologists globally, however this study proposes a novel analytical technique involving the combination of a statistical ranking algorithm and Remote sensing GIS data (habitat and threat) to analyze the suitability hierarchy of the habitat of a signature water-bird (Larus relictus). The results indicate that about 47.63% of the study region was suitable to accommodate L. Relictus during their breeding/resting season, while 27.08% proved to be highly unsuitable for this species. Based on the spatial distribution of the statistical data already incorporated into the GIS environment, it was observed that regions surrounding the Bojiang Lake (especially polygons 38 and 42) dominated by low vegetation and increased amount of moisture proved to be the best region for this species. On the contrary, polygon 23, located in the southern part of the study region proved to be the worst region for this species being dominated by significantly high amount of threat factors having the highest mean normalized hierarchical value and ranking 60th out of 61 in terms of standard deviation. To distinctively capture different suitability level of the study region, we could say that the application of this technique is quite effective and beneficial. This is because, compared to other decision making tools, this technique which solely relies on remote sensing and vector data gives decision makers an option of weight application if so desired. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

TI  - Introduction Of Tools For Geological Big Data Mining And Their Applications
JO  - Geotectonica et Metallogenia
PY  - 2020
AB  - The research paradigm of big data plays a key role in the emerging big data age. Geological research faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities, and calls for fundamental support by big data mining. This paper pays attention to a few tools of big data mining and their applications in geological field. With its powerful semantic processing ability and open organization ability, the knowledge map provides an effective tool for the knowledge-based organization and intelligent application of information in the big data age. It aims to describe the various entities or concepts that exist in the real world and their relationships. It constitutes a huge semantic network diagram. Nodes represent entities or concepts, and edges are composed of attributes or relationships. Machine learning and convolution neural network model is an important research hotspot in geological data mining. The evolutionary algorithm is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm which draws lesson from the mode of biological evolution and adaptive processes in nature. It is advantageous that it can carry out hidden parallel search without prior knowledge and can be used to accurately obtain the evolutionary trends and space-time characteristics hidden in large data. Graphical community detection technology divides the network into several internal nodes-similar communities, and provides strong technical support for analysis and understanding of networks. With the continuous improvement of spatial resolution, time resolution and radiation resolution, the remote sensing technology has become the main technical means to obtain geological data. Data access and intelligent processing is the most important development direction of remote sensing big data research. There are successful application cases of the methods above and they will be widely used in various geological studies. The intelligent monitoring, simulation, control and early warning of urban soil pollution has benefitted from the proper selection of supporting systems for large-scale data research and the strong support of large-scale data technology in the field of geology. Major barriers to the effective fusion of large data from multiple sources are diminishing. © 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - An Evaluation Of Remote Sensing Derived Soil Ph And Average Spring Groundwater Table For Ecological Assessments
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2015
AB  - Ecological assessments such as species distribution modelling and benchmarking site quality towards regulations often rely on full spatial coverage information of site factors such as soil acidity, moisture regime or nutrient availability. To determine if remote sensing (RS) is a viable alternative to traditional data sources of site factor estimates, we analysed the accuracy (using ground truth validation measurements) of traditional and RS sources of pH and mean spring groundwater level (MSL, in m) estimates. Traditional sources were a soil map and hydrological model. RS estimates were obtained using vegetation indicator values (IVs) from a Dutch national system as an intermediate between site factors and spectral response. IVs relate to those site factors that dictate vegetation occurrence, whilst also providing a robust link to canopy spectra. For pH, the soil map and the RS estimate were nearly as accurate. For MSL, the RS estimates were much closer to the observed groundwater levels than the hydrological model, but the error margin of the estimates still exceeded the tolerance range of moisture sensitive vegetation. The relatively high accuracy of the RS estimates was made possible by the availability of local calibration points and large environmental gradients in the study site. In addition, the error composition of the RS estimates could be analysed step-by-step, whereas the traditional sources had to be accepted 'as-is'. Also considering that RS offers high spatial and temporal resolution at low costs, RS offered advantages over traditional sources. This will likely hold true for any other situation where prerequisites of accurate RS estimates have been met. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - State-Wide Gis For Karnataka - K-Gis Benefits From Eo Images And Gis Services
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2014
AB  - The progressive state of Karnataka, in India, is establishing Karnataka (State) GIS (K-GIS) - which will realise the true power of EO and GIS by embedding them "within governance" and taken to "every citizen". Two of the 5 major elements of the K-GIS are key - one, a state-wide GIS Asset as an organised geo-database of EO images, satellite-based positioning data, digital maps, crowd-sourced data and geo-tagged attributes - all of these referenced and seamless as a GIS database that is constantly updated/maintained and served as "authoritative" data. Second, is the K-GIS Decision Support System (DSS) applications - a suite of GIS Applications services for different ministries/departments in government that enables better and informed governance; citizens - that empowers them with geographical content; to private enterprises for commercial GIS application services and for academia for education/research activities. As part of various developmental programmes, Governments fund, establish and maintain various types of assets and provide social benefits to citizens. There is no state-level Asset Register that can be monitored - thus same type of assets/works are taken up again and again and there is no transparent method of identifying beneficiaries. As part of a state-wide EO and GIS, a unique programme has been taken up to map and create a geo-spatial database of all public-funded Assets and map beneficiaries. While the GIS-based Asset register provides an inventory and helps monitoring/maintaining assets, it also helps in planning new developmental programmes/asset creation and also in planning social programmes for rightful beneficiaries. The Asset-GIS also helps in undertaking a financial analysis of allocation and ROI analysis - as it helps Government and citizens to immediately locate all Assets, their status and also identify distribution of Assets and funding status. The Assets under question total to about 45 individual Assets under 9 categories - agriculture assets, water resources assets, roads, education-assets, health assets, civic assets, communication assets, heritage assets and many others. Mapping and documentation of all public assets and beneficiaries of government support has already been undertaken for almost 1 Million Assets in 5 districts (later to expand to another 10 Million Assets in the state) using EO-image as a map/image base; survey grade precision GPS inventory and geo-tagged to individual Asset-MIS data - leading to a comprehensive Asset-GIS database. A GIS-based Decision Support System allows querying tools, allocation analysis, gap analysis, various MIS reports and other innovative EO-based GIS mapping services. This EO/GIS project in Karnataka is serving as a "common repository" accessible to all departments and citizens - leading to a transparent process of information flow for governance, financial allocation, planning and maintaining Assets - apart from identifying gap areas in developments and also identifying social benefits. The paper thus outlines the vision of K-GIS with specific examples of GIS Applications DSS in agriculture, water resources, city planning and administration, publicly funded project monitoring - key/specific examples of EO-images and map based GIS decision support examples of governance. The paper also outlines the scope of the Asset-GIS application and describes how geo-spatial techniques - a combination of EO images+GPS survey+ GIS Applications have enabled this Copyright © 2014 by the International Astronautical Federation All rights reserved.

TI  - The Use Of Gis And Remote Sensing Techniques As Tools For Managing Nature Reserves: The Case Of Kakum National Park In Ghana
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2001
AB  - Falling prices in export commodities especially in Sub-Saharan Africa has compelled countries like Ghana to explore its forests and wildlife reserves for foreign exchange. The forests are now under constant threat from fire, drought and the activities of local community groups. The managements of these forest reserves thus face severe problems. Current techniques for monitoring the forests in Ghana are ineffective, inconsistent, ad hoc and unreliable. The data collection is slow and often do not lend itself to a comprehensive analysis. Using satellite remote sensing (RS) coupled with geographic information systems (GIS) technologies have provided the capabilities to develop a database of information that permits systematic monitoring and an effective means of protecting the Kakum National Park in Ghana from the encroachment of local communities. Classifying the digital elevation model for Kakum, shows the roles the model plays in estimating park accessibility. The information conveyed in the DEM is of immediate assistance to park planners. A low accessibility will be associated with high elevation. The map information also shows where the park is most likely to experience damage from tourist and other activities. The use of slope and aspect maps provided an additional tool for management of the park. The depiction of slope, for instance indicated whether certain elevations faced enhanced fire risk or other hazards. The integration of SPOT satellite data with information from topographical data permitted the immediate display of terrain gradients, showing where most damages may occur due to height. This paper will highlight the reports of benefits that accrued from employing RS and GIS as management tools for forest and wildlife preservation in Ghana.

TI  - Human-Climate Induced Drivers Of Mountain Grassland Over The Last 40 Years In Sidama, Ethiopia: Perceptions Versus Empirical Evidence
JO  - Ecological Processes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Mountain grasslands are globally important ecosystems. They are considered as heritage sites with “outstanding values” to ecological communities by adding a further “layer and support to the existing protection measures.” However, mountain grasslands are increasingly under threat from human activities and impacts of climate change. Methods: Using satellite imagery, we studied land use/land cover (LULC) patterns between 1973 and 2015. Individual interviews consisting of 240 households for comparison and field data collection were conducted for accuracy assessment. Results: Five categories of LULC types were identified from the image classification that included forestland, grassland, shrubland, bushland, and agricultural land. Between 1973 and 2015, the forestland, grassland, and shrubland covers were declined by 15.9%, 53.6%, and 41.0%, respectively. In contrast, bushland and agricultural land were increased by 169% and 647%, respectively. The overall LULC classification accuracies for the four reference years ranged from 77.6 to 86.5% with Kappa statistic of 0.69 to 0.80. The majority of respondents (92.5%) mentioned that the cover of forestland outsized the other land use land cover types followed by grassland in the past. Conclusions: The stated indicators of land use/land cover changes linked to the impact of climate change were decline in milk yield and crop production, spread of livestock diseases, degradation of grazing lands, and change in the timing of rain. The results of the study suggest that human-climate related components were major drivers of land use/land cover dynamics that demand for proper management and conservation of mountain grassland ecosystem in Sidama South Ethiopia. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Assessing Population Sensitivity To Urban Air Pollution Using Google Trends And Remote Sensing Datasets
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study demonstrates relationship between remote sensing satellite retrieved fien aerosol concentration and web-based search volumes of air quality related keywords. People's perception of urban air pollution can verify policy effectiveness and gauge acceptability of policies. As a serious health issue in Asian cities, population may express concern or uncertainty for air pollution risk by performing search on the web to seek answers. A g€ social sensing' approach that monitors such search queries, may assess people' perception about air pollution as a risk. We hypothesize that trend and volume of searches show impact of air pollution on general population. The objectives of this research are to identify those atmospheric conditions under which relative search volume (RSV) obtained from Google Trends shows correlation with measured fine aerosol concentration, and to compare search volume sensitivity to rise in aerosol concentration in seven Asian megacities. We considered weekly relative search volumes from Google Trends (GT) for a four year period from January, 2015 to December, 2018 representing diverse PM2.5 concentrations. Search volumes for keywords corresponding to perception of air quality (air pollution') and health effects (cough' and asthma') were considered. To represent PM2.5 we used fine aerosol indicator developed in an earlier research. The results suggest that tendency to search for air pollution' and cough' occurs when AirRGB R is in excess and temperature is below the baseline values. Consistent with this, in cities with high baseline concentrations, sensitivity to rise in AirRGB R is also comparatively lower. The result of this study can used as an indirect measure of awareness in the form of perception and sensitivity of population to air quality. Such an analysis could be useful for forecasting health risks specially in cities lacking dedicated services. © 2020 Authors.

TI  - A Comperhensive Mapping Of The European-African Cooperation Using Satellite And Policy Persepctives
JO  - 61st International Astronautical Congress 2010, IAC 2010
PY  - 2010
AB  - Africa requires access to data, information, and knowledge for its sustainable development where space technologies through the use of satellites can be a tremendous benefit. Although some African countries have reached mature levels of space technology and use of satellite applications, most countries are struggling to maintain the basic levels needed for simple use. The international community, the European Union and the African countries themselves have set goals and strategies for the sustainable development in the African continent also through their commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The commitment of Europe to Africa is additionally strengthen by the African-European strategic partnership and the resulting action plans. Therefore, there are numerous of activities and actors engaged in Africa but there has been a lack of comprehensive mapping which results in inefficient use of resources. This paper is provides a mapping of actors and activities in Africa and draws policy perspectives on how to best utilise existing institutions, partnership and mechanisms for the sustainable development in Africa through the use of space based information and applications.

TI  - Use Of Google Earth™ To Strengthen Public Health Capacity And Facilitate Management Of Vector-Borne Diseases In Resource-Poor Environments
JO  - Bulletin of the World Health Organization
PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective: Novel, inexpensive solutions are needed for improved management of vector-borne and other diseases in resource-poor environments. Emerging free software providing access to satellite imagery and simple editing tools (e.g. Google Earth™) complement existing geographic information system (GIS) software and provide new opportunities for: (i) strengthening overall public health capacity through development of information for city infrastructures; and (ii) display of public health data directly on an image of the physical environment. Methods: We used freely accessible satellite imagery and a set of feature-making tools included in the software (allowing for production of polygons, lines and points) to generate information for city infrastructure and to display disease data in a dengue decision support system (DDSS) framework. Findings: Two cities in Mexico (Chetumal and Merida) were used to demonstrate that a basic representation of city infrastructure useful as a spatial backbone in a DDSS can be rapidly developed at minimal cost. Data layers generated included labelled polygons representing city blocks, lines representing streets, and points showing the locations of schools and health clinics. City blocks were colour-coded to show presence of dengue cases. The data layers were successfully imported in a format known as shapefile into a GIS software. Conclusion: The combination of Google Earth™ and free GIS software (e.g. HealthMapper, developed by WHO, and SIGEpi, developed by PAHO) has tremendous potential to strengthen overall public health capacity and facilitate decision support system approaches to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.

TI  - Canopy And Surface Fuel Estimations Using Rpas And Ground-Based Point Clouds
JO  - FORESTRY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Forest management activities intended to reduce wildfire risk rely on accurate characterizations of the amount and arrangement of canopy and surface fuels. Metrics that describe these fuels are typically estimated with various systems that transform plot-level field data into metrics that can be used within fire behaviour models. Remote sensing data have long been used to estimate these metrics across large spatial scales, but more advanced, high-density point clouds have the potential to estimate these metrics with higher accuracy. This study collected LiDAR and digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) point clouds from a remotely piloted aerial system (RPAS), as well as mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds from a mobile ground-based system, and compared their ability to estimate fuel metrics. This involved the extraction of predictor variables from each point cloud, of which small subsets were used to estimate various fuel metrics. These included six overstory canopy metrics (stand height, canopy cover, tree density, canopy fuel load, canopy bulk density and canopy base height), three diameter at breast height (DBH)-related metrics (stand density index, basal area and quadratic mean diameter) and three surface fuel metrics (total woody debris (TWD), coarse woody debris (CWD) and fine woody debris (FWD)). Overall, canopy metrics were estimated most accurately by the RPAS LiDAR models, although none of the point clouds were able to accurately estimate DBH-related metrics. For the other six canopy metrics, RPAS LiDAR models had an average R-2 value of 0.70; DAP - 0.63 and MLS - 0.63. CWD (>7 cm) and TWD loads were estimated most accurately by the MLS models (average R-2 values - 0.70), followed by the RPAS LiDAR - 0.38 and DAP - 0.13. None of these models were able to accurately estimate FWD loads (<= 7 cm in diameter), with the three types of point clouds having a maximum R-2 value of 0.08. Overall, this research shows the relative ability of three types of high-density point clouds to estimate metrics relevant for fire behaviour modeling.

TI  - Analysis Of Vegetation Patterns In The Hispaniola Island Using Avhrr Data
PY  - 2006
AB  - Tropical forest deforestation is an important concern and remote sensing techniques are key elements that can lead us to a better evaluation of its dynamics. The study of the spatial and temporal vegetation patterns by means of vegetation indexes has been widely used at a global and regional scale. Transition zones between countries with different cultures and environmental policy are important cases of study, like the one that is shown here, that takes place in the Caribbean Island of the Hispaniola. Making use of the Global Land 1-km AVHRR project data set, monthly NDVI and land surface temperature trends have been analyzed for a one year period in the Hispaniola. In order to address the great contrast between countries, present study has been concentrated on the vegetation dynamics across the border region. It is attempted to show the utility of these two variables to confirm much higher mean monthly NDVI trends in the Dominican side and remark the more extreme biomass changes and over pressure against Haiti natural forests.

TI  - High Plant Species Richness In Monospecific Tree Plantations In The Central Amazon
JO  - Forest Ecology and Management
PY  - 2013
AB  - Because forest plantations cover an extensive area worldwide, they play an important role shaping current biodiversity conservation policies. This study evaluated plant species richness in the regenerating forest community beneath five 35-year-old homogeneous forest stands consisting of indigenous terra-firme species (Simarouba amara, Dipteryx odorata, Bagassa guianensis, Jacaranda copaia and Dinizia excelsa). These data were compared to adjacent primary forests in the Manaus region, Amazonas state, Brazil. These plantations are among the oldest native tree plantations of the Brazilian Amazon. All studied stands showed species richness near that of the primary forest, with the single exception being J. copaia. The relationship between species composition and the environmental variables was studied by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The CCA yielded correlations that were validated by a permutation test between species composition and canopy openness, nitrogen content, pH, base saturation and soil aluminum content. Our results showed that long standing homogenous plantation stands can provide high levels of density and species richness of the understory, comparable to those found in the surrounding primary forest. This finding reinforces the value of anthropogenic landscapes for conserving biodiversity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Space Hospital: How Future Space-Based Medical Infrastructures Could Revolutionize Tomorrow's Health Care System
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2020
AB  - After the first paying passengers on-board the International Space Station (ISS) between 2001 and 2009, a considerable number of space tourism mission concepts has risen, aiming at a large multiplicity of platforms, typically from already existing small size suborbital spaceplanes to future large-scale touristic space stations. On the other hand, many years of space-based research on biological systems has demonstrated how the space environment, and in particular micro-gravity, can introduce beneficial effects on humans for what concerns, as an example, cardiovascular and neoplastic pathologies. When considering the treatments for such diseases, microgravity and exposure of patients to the space environment could represent a visionary healthcare provision in the future space era where affordable, low-risk launch and space transportation systems will be granted and available to everyone. The healthcare space-based infrastructure would benefit from the advancements in space systems introduced by the touristic and commercial space outposts, but by specializing their mission for providing medical treatment to “patient astronauts”. In a far future scenario of an homogeneous, wide access to manned space infrastructures for the large majority of humanity, the patients could benefit from considering microgravity a treatment and a part of an international public medical infrastructure. As an example of the potential diseases to be addressed, microgravity can induce beneficial effects to patients experiencing cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure, contributing with a pressure drop and a heart contractility improvement, while the microgravity-driven induction of a lower heart frequency can help patients suffering from atrial and ventricular fibrillation. In addition to cardiac diseases, neoplastic pathologies such as melanoma could benefit from being treated in microgravity, leading to a reduction of the neoplasm aggressivity and with a consequent increase of a therapeutic efficacy. Besides the user-end systems, represented by the space hospital station ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support Systems) for long-term permanence in space and by the systems devoted to actually treating patients, huge improvements in all fields of space engineering and manned space explorations shall be introduced. This paper presents a concept for a medical treatment “hospital” space station. After a description of the current trends for commercial and touristic large-scale spaceborne infrastructures concepts, the potential beneficiaries of microgravity treatments are outlined with the disease to be treated. Then, an outline of the space station subsystems and architecture is presented with a roadmap of the key technologies to be dramatically improved for the introduction of similar infrastructures.

TI  - Grace Satellite-Based Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Evolution And Driving Factors Of Groundwater Storage In The Black Soil Region Of Northeast China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Clarifying the evolution pattern of groundwater storage (GWS) is crucial for exploring the amount of available water resources at a regional or basin scale. Currently, the groundwater resources of Northeast China have been extensively exploited, but only limited studies have assessed the extent of GWS depletion and its driving mechanisms. In this study, the groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) in the black soil region of Northeast China was explored based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite combined with the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological model. The results show that from 2002 to 2021, the overall GWSA decreased (-0.4204 cm/a), and specifically, the average rates of decrease in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces were -0.2786, -0.5923, and -0.6694 cm/a, respectively, with the eastern, southern, and central parts of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces losing seriously. Especially the GWSA deficit trend can reach -0.7471 cm/a in southern Jilin Province. The GWSA deficits in the three provinces from April to September were greater than 0.40 cm/a, while the deficit values from January to March and from October to December were less than 0.40 cm/a. This study is the first to quantitatively analyze the GWSA and its influencing factors in Northeast China for 2002-2021. The results of the study help clarify the differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater resources and their driving mechanisms in the northeastern black soil regions and provide a reference for the conservation and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the black soil region.

TI  - Measurements Of Electromagnetic Fields Radiated From Communication Equipment And Of Environmental Electromagnetic Noise: Impact On The Use Of Communication Equipment Within The Hospital
JO  - Biomedical Instrumentation and Technology
PY  - 1998
AB  - The increasing use of all types of cellular telephones requires the formulation of new standards to ensure the immunity of electronic medical equipment to electromagnetic radiation. It will be many years before all hospital medical equipment conforms to new and higher standards. Until that time, the medical, security, maintenance, and other staff will need to be ever vigilant regarding restrictions on the use of wireless equipment within the hospital, to prevent potential danger to the lives of the patients. A comprehensive hospital policy must be formulated to reduce risks to patients from equipment susceptible to electro-magnetic interference (EMI). Such an aim should address the following needs: To devise a uniform policy for the instruction of hospital staff, visitors, and patients, thereby reducing confusion regarding the use of cellular telephones, beepers, and portable transceivers. To implement a policy that avoids unwarranted restrictions but does not ignore statistical evidence regarding potential EMI problems.

TI  - Mapping And Imaging The Internet
JO  - Bulletin of the Society of Cartographers
PY  - 2002
AB  - The Internet is awash with a wealth of maps and spatial imagery, some crude and basic, some refined and highly developed. The availability of maps and imagery over the Internet and the sophistication of the methods used to display such spatial images will almost certainly increase and so continue to revolutionise the way maps and remotely-sensed images are marketed and delivered worldwide. With increasing international internet access and faster bandwidths, the mapping community is well-placed to allow users to benefit from Internet Mapping technology. There are three possible options that can be identified for delivering and viewing maps and imagery over the Internet - static, animated and interactive. Static mapping and imagery web sites allow the user to access fixed raster maps and remotely sensed images for viewing and downloading over the Internet. Static maps and images are usually generated by raster scanning or direct vector-to-raster conversion. Animated web sites allow the user to view maps and imagery dynamically as the content changes, utilising file formats such as Gif89a and MPEG together with delayed refreshing of HTML pages and multi-media video technology. Interactive web sites allow the user to zoom or scroll high resolution raster or vector images and to make decisions on map content or design with the use of plug-ins (e.g. Adobe Acrobat. Macromedia Flash, LizardTech Mr Sid and ERMapping ECW), applets, javascripts or with dedicated GIS web map servers.

TI  - Joint User Association And Beamforming In Integrated Satellite-Haps-Ground Networks
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology
PY  - 2023
AB  - This paper proposes and evaluates the benefit of, one particular hybrid satellite-high-altitude-platform-station (HAPS)-ground network, where one HAPS connected to one geo-satellite assists the ground base stations (BSs) at serving ground-level users. The paper assumes that the geo-satellite is connected to the HAPS using free-space-optical backhaul links. The HAPS, equipped with multiple antennas, aims at transmitting the geo-satellite data to the users via radio-frequency (RF) links using spatial-multiplexing. Each ground BS, on the other hand, is equipped with multiple antennas, but directly serves the users through the RF links. The paper then focuses on maximizing the network-wide throughput, subject to HAPS payload connectivity constraint, HAPS and BSs power constraints, and backhaul constraints, so as to jointly determine the user-association strategy of each user (i.e., user to geo-satellite via HAPS, or user to BS), and their associated beamforming vectors. We tackle such a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem using an iterative approach, where the user-association is determined using a combination of integer linear programming and generalized assignment problems, and where the beamforming strategy is found using a weighted-minimum-mean-squared-error approach. The simulations illustrate the appreciable gain of our proposed algorithm, and highlight the prospects of augmenting the ground networks with beamforming-empowered HAPS for connecting the unconnected, and super-connecting the connected.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Volcanic Processes And Risk
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Remote sensing data and methods are increasingly being embedded into assessments of volcanic processes and risk. This happens thanks to their capability to provide a spectrum of observation and measurement opportunities to accurately sense the dynamics, magnitude, frequency, and impacts of volcanic activity in the ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), infrared (IR), and microwave domains. Launched in mid-2018, the Special Issue "Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk" ofRemote Sensinggathers 19 research papers on the use of satellite, aerial, and ground-based remote sensing to detect thermal features and anomalies, investigate lava and pyroclastic flows, predict the flow path of lahars, measure gas emissions and plumes, and estimate ground deformation. The strong multi-disciplinary character of the approaches employed for volcano monitoring and the combination of a variety of sensor types, platforms, and methods that come out from the papers testify the current scientific and technology trends toward multi-data and multi-sensor monitoring solutions. The research advances presented in the published papers are achieved thanks to a wealth of data including but not limited to the following: thermal IR from satellite missions (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER, TET-1) and ground-based stations (e.g., FLIR cameras); digital elevation/surface models from airborne sensors (e.g., Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), or 3D laser scans) and satellite imagery (e.g., tri-stereo Pleiades, SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope); airborne hyperspectral surveys; geophysics (e.g., ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction, magnetic survey); ground-based acoustic infrasound; ground-based scanning UV spectrometers; and ground-based and satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging (e.g., TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2). Data processing approaches and methods include change detection, offset tracking, Interferometric SAR (InSAR), photogrammetry, hotspots and anomalies detection, neural networks, numerical modeling, inversion modeling, wavelet transforms, and image segmentation. Some authors also share codes for automated data analysis and demonstrate methods for post-processing standard products that are made available for end users, and which are expected to stimulate the research community to exploit them in other volcanological application contexts. The geographic breath is global, with case studies in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Hawai'i, Alaska, Kamchatka, Japan, Indonesia, Vanuatu, Reunion Island, Ethiopia, Canary Islands, Greece, Italy, and Iceland. The added value of the published research lies on the demonstration of the benefits that these remote sensing technologies have brought to knowledge of volcanoes that pose risk to local communities; back-analysis and critical revision of recent volcanic eruptions and unrest periods; and improvement of modeling and prediction methods. Therefore, this Special Issue provides not only a collection of forefront research in remote sensing applied to volcanology, but also a selection of case studies proving the societal impact that this scientific discipline can potentially generate on volcanic hazard and risk management.

TI  - Seasonal Flow Forecasting Using Satellite-Driven Precipitation Data For Awash And Omo-Gibe Basins, Ethiopia
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Hydrologic extreme events such as flooding impact people and the environment and delay sustainable development in flood-prone areas when it is excessive. The present study developed a seasonal floodwater forecast system for the Awash and Omo-Gibe basins of Ethiopia using the 2021 rainy season (June to September) as a temporal case study. In Ethiopia, there is no seasonal forecasting system available to cope with the recurrent flooding impacts instead of exercising ineffective and traditional monitoring approaches. The satellite-driven precipitation and temperature forecasts, observed rainfall, discharge, reservoir water levels, land cover, and soil data were used in the hydrologic (HEC-HMS) and hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models, spreadsheet, and GIS applications. The results obtained were forecasts of the runoff, reservoir water levels, and storage. The coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent of bias (Pbias), and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) were used to evaluate the model's performance in addition to plots as presented in the manuscript. The R-2 values obtained for the Koka and Gibe-3 reservoirs' inflows (water levels) were 0.97 (0.95) and 0.93 (0.99), respectively, and the NSE values were 0.90 (0.88) and 0.92 (0.95) for each reservoir. Similarly, the water levels (meter) and storage (Mm(3)) for the Koka and Gibe-3 reservoirs at the end of the 2021 flood season were 111.0 (1467.58) and 890.8 (13,638.5), respectively. Excess floodwater can be maintained in and released from reservoirs depending on the future water uses and flood monitoring activities downstream. In addition, the flood inundation extents from Earth remote sensing satellite observation and model results were examined and showed agreement.

TI  - Deep Learning Method Of Landslide Inventory Map With Imbalanced Samples In Optical Remote Sensing
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landslide inventory mapping (LIM) is a key prerequisite for landslide susceptibility evaluation and disaster mitigation. It aims to record the location, size, and extent of landslides in each map scale. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), have been increasingly applied to landslide detection using remote sensing images in recent decades. However, their limitations have impeded their wide application. Furthermore, despite the widespread use of deep learning algorithms in remote sensing, for LIM, deep learning algorithms are limited to less unbalanced landslide samples. To this end, in this study, full convolution networks with focus loss (FCN-FL) were adopted to map historical landslides in regions with imbalanced samples using an improved symmetrically connected full convolution network and focus loss function to increase the feature level and reduce the contribution of the background loss value. In addition, K-fold cross-validation training models (FCN-FLK) were used to improve data utilization and model robustness. Results showed that the recall rate, F1-score, and mIoU of the model were improved by 0.08, 0.09, and 0.15, respectively, compared to FCN. It also demonstrated advantages over U-Net and SegNet. The results prove that the method proposed in this study can solve the problem of imbalanced sample in landslide inventory mapping. This research provides a reference for addressing imbalanced samples in the deep learning of LIM. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - The Burden Of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A(H1n1) In The Netherlands
JO  - European Journal of Public Health
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: The disease burden of the 2009 influenza pandemic has been debated but reliable estimates are lacking. To guide future policy and control, these estimates are necessary. This study uses burden of disease measurements to assess the contribution of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus to the overall burden of disease in the Netherlands. Methods: The burden of disease caused by 2009 pandemic influenza was estimated by calculating Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), a composite measure that combines incidence, sequelae and mortality associated with a disease, taking duration and severity into account. Available influenza surveillance data sources (primary care sentinel surveillance, notification data on hospitalizations and deaths and death registries) were used. Besides a baseline scenario, five alternative scenarios were used to assess effects of changing values of input parameters. Results: The baseline scenario showed a loss of 5800 DALY for the Netherlands (35 DALY per 100 000 population). This corresponds to 0.13 of the estimated annual disease burden in the Netherlands and is comparable to the estimated disease burden of seasonal influenza, despite a different age distribution in incidence and mortality of the pandemic compared to seasonal influenza. Conclusions: This disease burden estimate confirmed that, although there was a higher mortality observed among young people, the 2009 pandemic was overall a mild influenza epidemic. The disease burden of this pandemic was comparable to the burden of seasonal influenza in the Netherlands. © The Author 2010.

TI  - Planning For Optimum Soil Erosion Management Based On Remote Sensing And Geographic Information System: Case Of Watershed In Nepal
JO  - 34th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2013, ACRS 2013
PY  - 2013
AB  - Soil erosion is considered a serious threat to long-term viability of agriculture in many parts of the world. Land resources undergo degradation due to landslide, accelerated soil erosion and declining fertility. The objective of this study is to estimate an economic impact of water induced soil erosion in Phewa watershed, Nepal and to identify optimum soil erosion management plan. Environmental impacts were examined using a combination of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) while an economic model and mathematical programming were used to assess the economic value of soil erosion. The analyses were showed that the total income of the watershed citizen was reduced with the effects of soil erosion in the comparison with baseline scenario (without erosion) and alternative scenario. Scenario result of soil erosion showed that erosion by water loss had a negative impact in the agriculture productivity. The first scenario showed that total income reduced about 20% and total area of rain fed crop was decreased. The second scenario showed that total income of watershed was reduced with 30% because of lack of water in winter season. The result of this study can help decision makers to plan optimum soil erosion management and conservation measures to soil and water resources. Mapping of soil erosion risk is also useful to identify the vulnerable areas. Decision maker can use economic values of soil erosion to prioritize areas of soil conservation.

TI  - Vegetation Monitoring For Guatemala: A Comparison Between Simulated Viirs And Modis Satellite Data
JO  - Geocarto International
PY  - 2010
AB  - The advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are being widely used for vegetation monitoring across the globe. However, sensors will discontinue collecting these data in the near future. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning to launch a new sensor, visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS), to continue to provide satellite data for vegetation monitoring. This article presents a case study of Guatemala and compares the simulated VIIRS-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with MODIS-NDVI for four different dates each in 2003 and 2005. The dissimilarity between VIIRS-NDVI and MODIS-NDVI was examined on the basis of the percent difference, the two-tailed student's t-test, and the coefficient of determination, R2. The per cent difference was found to be within 3%, the p-value ranged between 0.52 and 0.99, and R2 exceeded 0.88 for all major types of vegetation (basic grains, rubber, sugarcane, coffee and forests) found in Guatemala. It was therefore concluded that VIIRS will be almost equally capable of vegetation monitoring as MODIS. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - A Vision For Hydrological Prediction
JO  - Atmosphere
PY  - 2020
AB  - IMproving PRedictions and management of hydrological EXtremes (IMPREX) was a European Union Horizon 2020 project that ran from September 2015 to September 2019. IMPREX aimed to improve society's ability to anticipate and respond to future extreme hydrological events in Europe across a variety of uses in the water-related sectors (flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, agriculture, navigation, hydropower and water supply utilities). Through the engagement with stakeholders and continuous feedback between model outputs and water applications, progress was achieved in better understanding the way hydrological predictions can be useful to (and operationally incorporated into) problem-solving in the water sector. The work and discussions carried out during the project nurtured further reflections toward a common vision for hydrological prediction. In this article, we summarized the main findings of the IMPREX project within a broader overview of hydrological prediction, providing a vision for improving such predictions. In so doing, we first presented a synopsis of hydrological and weather forecasting, with a focus on medium-range to seasonal scales of prediction for increased preparedness. Second, the lessons learned from IMPREX were discussed. The key findings were the gaps highlighted in the global observing system of the hydrological cycle, the degree of accuracy of hydrological models and the techniques of post-processing to correct biases, the origin of seasonal hydrological skill in Europe and user requirements of hydrometeorological forecasts to ensure their appropriate use in decision-making models and practices. Last, a vision for how to improve these forecast systems/products in the future was expounded, including advancing numerical weather and hydrological models, improved earth monitoring and more frequent interaction between forecasters and users to tailor the forecasts to applications. We conclude that if these improvements can be implemented in the coming years, earth system and hydrological modelling will become more skillful, thus leading to socioeconomic benefits for the citizens of Europe and beyond. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Post Mining Analytics From Space: An Innovative Approach To Improve Risk-Management In Mining
JO  - 2020 SME Annual Conference and Expo
PY  - 2020
AB  - Mining activities have increasingly become a focus of politics, the authorities and the public. This development is driven by the climate and environmental discussion. Social, environmental and political and acceptance of mining are becoming increasingly difficult despite increasing demands for minerals and raw materials. In Germany, the extraction of bituminous coal has ceased and lignite mining is slated to be phased out by 2038. Catastrophic tailings dam failures have attracted worldwide attention. Public views of mining and minerals extraction in the United States of America are quite similar. Yet, critical materials require mining and processing of specific minerals, for which responsible natural resources development is essential. Therefore, in today´s mine life cycle, risk management is an integral part of the mining process. This paper describes innovative methods monitor environmental impacts from mining. These include sensor-based early warning systems for mining risk management throughout the mine life cycle and into the post-mining phase. It discusses how mining engineers utilize big data from earth observation and digital technologies to mitigate environmental impacts and create sustainable value. Copyright © 2020 by SME

TI  - Analysis On Management Policies On Water Quantity Conflict In Transboundary Rivers Embedded With Virtual Water-Using Ili River As The Case
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Current studies neglect how virtual water transfer (VWT) between countries within a drainage basin affects water stress and then yields an invisible effect on the water quantity conflict in transboundary rivers, which would further make management policies on water quantity conflict less fair and reasonable. Therefore, this study first constructs the Inequality Index of VWT and water stress index (WSI) to assess water stress. Next, different types are set according to the Inequality Index and WSI to analyze management policies, with Ili River as the case. Results show: (1) Within the study period, from 1996, the Inequality Index of VWT between China and Kazakhstan stayed at 0.368 (0.368 < 0.5), indicating a relatively high inequality of VWT between the two countries-China at a disadvantage, while Kazakhstan having the upper hand. (2) According to the remotely sensed data, WSI in the riparian zones of the Ili River rose from 0.288 to 0421 in China, and 0214 to 0.402 in Kazakhstan, showing intermediate scarcity. (3) China and Kazakhstan both fall into Type 2, and Kazakhstan has the advantageous position. Therefore, while allocating the water resources of the Ili River, Kazakhstan should lower its expectation and proactively ask to exchange benefits in other aspects to reverse the outward transfer of its physical water. In addition, the two countries should find suitable ways to go about water rights trading to reduce the possibility of potential water quantity conflict.

TI  - Avoidable Mortality Attributable To Anthropogenic Fine Particulate Matter (Pm2.5) In Australia
JO  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ambient fine particulate matter <2.5 _m(PM2.5) air pollution increases premature mortality globally. Some PM2.5 is natural, but anthropogenic PM2.5 is comparatively avoidable. We determined the impact of long-term exposures to the anthropogenic PM component on mortality in Australia. PM2.5-attributable deaths were calculated for all Australian Statistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 2310) regions. All-cause death rates from Australian mortality and population databases were combined with annual anthropogenic PM2.5 exposures for the years 2006–2016. Relative risk estimates were derived from the literature. Population-weighted average PM2.5 concentrations were estimated in each SA2 using a satellite and land use regression model for Australia. PM2.5-attributable mortality was calculated using a health-impact assessment methodology with life tables and all-cause death rates. The changes in life expectancy (LE) from birth, years of life lost (YLL), and economic cost of lost life years were calculated using the 2019 value of a statistical life. Nationally, long-term populationweighted average total and anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations were 6.5 _g/m3 (min 1.2–max 14.2) and 3.2 _g/m3 (min 0–max 9.5), respectively. Annually, anthropogenic PM2.5-pollution is associated with 2616 (95% confidence intervals 1712, 3455) deaths, corresponding to a 0.2-year (95% CI 0.14, 0.28) reduction in LE for children aged 0–4 years, 38,962 (95%CI 25,391, 51,669) YLL and an average annual economic burden of $6.2 billion (95%CI $4.0 billion, $8.1 billion). We conclude that the anthropogenic PM2.5-related costs of mortality in Australia are higher than community standards should allow, and reductions in emissions are recommended to achieve avoidable mortality. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Identifying The Influence Of Exceptional Events And International Transport: An Overview Of When And How To Apply Clean Air Act Provisions For Background Ozone
JO  - American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, AFPM - Environmental Conference 2016
PY  - 2016
AB  - In October, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a more stringent ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 70 parts per billion (ppb). The lowering of the standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppb makes it more likely that background ozone due to natural sources (e.g. wildfires, stratospheric ozone) or international transport can cause U.S. ozone monitors to exceed the NAAQS even when local emissions from human activities are minimal. Because background ozone is not controllable, the Clean Air Act (CAA) provides avenues for mitigating regulatory impacts of ozone due to emissions beyond local control. The Exceptional Events Rule states that if an exceedance of the ozone NAAQS can be shown to be caused by an uncontrollable, unusual event such as a wildfire or stratospheric ozone intrusion, the exceedance day may be excluded from the calculation of the monitor's ozone design value1, potentially lowering the design value and even changing nonattainment status to attainment. If an area is shown to be influenced by transport from outside the U.S., CAA Section 179B may provide relief from some planning requirements and penalties for nonattainment areas where air quality would meet the NAAQS but for foreign anthropogenic emissions. In this paper, we outline methods for screening individual days in order to determine whether they may qualify for exclusion under the Exceptional Events Rule or for application of the Section 179B international transport rules. We present examples of the use of ambient monitoring data, satellite imagery and modeling to identify each type of event. We show how photochemical model ozone source apportionment tools (OSAT) are used to determine the geographic origin of ozone at a specific location and time and to quantify how much of that ozone comes from background ozone and how much from human activities. OSAT can further divide the contribution from human activities into contributions from different emissions categories such as vehicles, electric generating units, oil and gas, etc. We describe how the relevant analyses are assembled into a demonstration package for submission to EPA.

TI  - Regional And Global Modeling Estimates Of Policy Relevant Background Ozone Over The United States
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2012
AB  - Policy Relevant Background (PRB) ozone, as defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), refers to ozone concentrations that would occur in the absence of all North American anthropogenic emissions. PRB enters into the calculation of health risk benefits, and as the US ozone standard approaches background levels, PRB is increasingly important in determining the feasibility and cost of compliance. As PRB is a hypothetical construct, modeling is a necessary tool. Since 2006 EPA has relied on global modeling to establish PRB for their regulatory analyses. Recent assessments with higher resolution global models exhibit improved agreement with remote observations and modest upward shifts in PRB estimates. This paper shifts the paradigm to a regional model (CAMx) run at 12. km resolution, for which North American boundary conditions were provided by a low-resolution version of the GEOS-Chem global model. We conducted a comprehensive model inter-comparison, from which we elucidate differences in predictive performance against ozone observations and differences in temporal and spatial background variability over the US. In general, CAMx performed better in replicating observations at remote monitoring sites, and performance remained better at higher concentrations. While spring and summer mean PRB predicted by GEOS-Chem ranged 20-45. ppb, CAMx predicted PRB ranged 25-50. ppb and reached well over 60. ppb in the west due to event-oriented phenomena such as stratospheric intrusion and wildfires. CAMx showed a higher correlation between modeled PRB and total observed ozone, which is significant for health risk assessments. A case study during April 2006 suggests that stratospheric exchange of ozone is underestimated in both models on an event basis. We conclude that wildfires, lightning NO. x and stratospheric intrusions contribute a significant level of uncertainty in estimating PRB, and that PRB will require careful consideration in the ozone standard setting process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Modeling Based On Remote Sensing Data And Data Mining Techniques
JO  - Environmental Earth Sciences
PY  - 2022
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to apply three advanced landslide susceptibility models (Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), forest by penalizing attributes (FPA), and functional tree (FT)) to evaluate the landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China. Firstly, 12 landslide conditioning factors were prepared based on the local geo-environmental characteristics and relevant studies, including slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), lithology, soil, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. Secondly, a landslide inventory map consisting of 279 landslides was randomly divided into training and validation datasets with the ratio of 70/30. Then, a certainty factors (CF) model was used to analyze the relationship between landslides and the classes of landslide conditioning factors, and a Chi-Squared statistic was used for contribution analysis. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-value) and some statistical parameters are used to compare and verify the three landslide susceptibility models. After comparison and validation, the FPA model should be used as the best model for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Muchuan County in this study. This study can provide valuable information for local governments or organizations to study slope stability. At the same time, the landslide susceptibility map obtained can be a tool for reference for infrastructure planning, engineering design, and disaster mitigation design in the study area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

JO  - COVID-19 and the Sustainable Development Goals
PY  - 2022
AB  - COVID-19 epidemic struck without warning, wreaking havoc on all aspects of society. The chapter discusses the quantification of impacts of COVID-19-induced control strategies and restricted resource consumption on sustainable development goals (SDGs), focusing on SDG-3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) and SDG-13 (Climate Action). The impacts of reduced PM2.5 emission are monitored using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data for India (2020–21) and the reduction in the morbidity and mortality is valued using the cost of illness (COI), disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and value of statistical life (VSL). The reported reduction of CO2e emissions of about 40% during the year, in the cities, is quantified for the country and monetized using the regional values of the social cost of carbon (SCC). The chapter also lays a framework for quantifying and valuing such impacts related to other SDGs and can be used by policymakers for implementation and quantified decision-making. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Air Temperature Mapping By Fusing Remote Sensing, Station, Simulation And Socioeconomic Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - Air temperature (Ta) is an essential climatological component that controls and influences various earth surface processes. In this study, we make the first attempt to employ deep learning for Ta mapping mainly based on space remote sensing and ground station observations. Considering that Ta varies greatly in space and time and is sensitive to many factors, assimilation data and socioeconomic data are also included for a multi-source data fusion based estimation. Specifically, a 5-layers structured deep belief network (DBN) is employed to better capture the complicated and non-linear relationships between Ta and different predictor variables. Layer-wise pre-training process for essential features extraction and fine-tuning process for weight parameters optimization ensure the robust prediction of Ta spatio-temporal distribution. The DBN model was implemented for 0.01 degrees daily maximum Ta mapping across China. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicate that the DBN model achieves promising results with the RMSE of 1.996 degrees C, MAE of 1.539 degrees C, and R of 0.986 at the national scale. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) method, the DBN model reduces the MAE values by 1.340 degrees C, 0.387 degrees C and 0.222 degrees C, respectively. Further analysis on spatial distribution and temporal tendency of prediction errors both validate the great potentials of DBN in Ta estimation.

TI  - Inverted Algorithm Of Groundwater Storage Anomalies By Combining The Gnss, Grace/Grace-Fo, And Gldas: A Case Study In The North China Plain
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - As the largest groundwater drainage region in China, the per capita water resources in the North China Plain (NCP) account for only one-seventh of the country's available water resources. Currently, the NCP is experiencing a serious water shortage due to the overexploitation of groundwater resources and a subsequent series of natural disasters. Thus, accurate regional assessments and effective water resource management policies are of critical importance. To accomplish this phenomenon, the daily terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) over the NCP is calculated from the combination of the GNSS vertical deformation sequences (seasonal items) and GRACE (trend items). The groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) in the NCP is obtained by subtracting the canopy water, soil water, and snow water equivalent components from the TWSA. The inversion results of this study are verified by comparisons with the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data products. The elevated annual amplitude areas are located in Beijing and Tianjin, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between the two GWSA results are 0.67, 4.01 cm, and 0.61, respectively. This indicates that the methods proposed in this study are reliable. Finally, the groundwater drought index was calculated for the period from 2011 to 2021, and the results showed that 2019 was the driest year, with a drought severity index value of -0.12, indicative of slightly moderate drought conditions. By calculating and analyzing the annual GWSA, this work shows that the South-North Water Transfer Project does provide some regional drought mitigation.

TI  - Automatic Detection Of Woody Vegetation In Repeat Landscape Photographs Using A Convolutional Neural Network
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Repeat photography is an efficient method for documenting long-term landscape changes. So far, the usage of repeat photographs for quantitative analyses is limited to approaches based on manual classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection and classification of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. We also tested if the classification results based on the automatic approach can be used for quantifying changes in woody vegetation cover between image pairs. The CNN was trained with 50 x 50 pixel tiles of woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation. We then tested the classifier on 17 pairs of repeat photographs to assess the model performance on unseen data. Results show that the CNN performed well in differentiating woody vegetation from non-woody vegetation (accuracy = 87.7\%), but accuracy varied strongly between individual images. The very similar appearance of woody vegetation and herbaceous species in photographs made this a much more challenging task compared to the classification of vegetation as a single class (accuracy = 95.2\%). In this regard, image quality was identified as one important factor influencing classification accuracy. Although the automatic classification provided good individual results on most of the 34 test photographs, change statistics based on the automatic approach deviated from actual changes. Nevertheless, the automatic approach was capable of identifying clear trends in increasing or decreasing woody vegetation in repeat photographs. Generally, the use of repeat photography in landscape monitoring represents a significant added value to other quantitative data retrieved from remote sensing and field measurements. Moreover, these photographs are able to raise awareness on landscape change among policy makers and public as well as they provide clear feedback on the effects of land management.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Management Of Breast Cancer Concurrent With Pregnancy
JO  - Journal of the American College of Surgeons
PY  - 2002
AB  - The management of PABC is very difficult. The incidence of PABC is low, but may be increasing because of the number of women who are becoming pregnant at a later age. More investigation is needed to understand whether the biology of PABC is different from that of breast cancer in nonpregnant women. One exciting area of further research is the potential relationship between mutations in known breast cancer susceptibility genes and breast cancer development during pregnancy. Diagnosis of PABC remains challenging because of the anatomic and physiologic changes that occur in the breast during pregnancy. Understanding the genetic influences on PABC may help physicians in diagnosing this disease earlier, and understanding the tumor-receptor characteristics of PABC can help physicians deliver effective treatment. The various modalities available for treatment of PABC and their risks and benefits must be discussed openly with patients and their families. Abortion is not usually recommended. Modified radical mastectomy is the recommended treatment for PABC diagnosed during the first trimester. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy can be given with minimal risks to the fetus during the second or third trimester. Radiation therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy because of the potential for injury to the fetus. Breast conservation therapy, with radiation treatments given after delivery or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, is an option for women with PABC diagnosed late in pregnancy. Once the appropriate treatment modality is chosen, its implementation must not be delayed because of the pregnancy. Most of the literature shows that women with PABC have the same survival stage for stage as nonpregnant women with breast cancer. But some studies suggest that the prognosis is worse for patients who present with advanced-stage PABC. Finally, recurrence and survival in most patients previously treated for breast cancer do not appear to be adversely affected by subsequent pregnancy. Above all, the patient with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy is best served by early and continued involvement of a multidisciplinary cancer treatment team.

TI  - Geomorphological Evolution Along International Riverine Borders: The Flow Of The Aras River Through Iran, Azerbaijan, And Armenia
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2021
AB  - International rivers are one of the most politicized natural resources. Their dynamism, whether driven by the influence of natural processes or artificial drivers, can generate political issues between countries where de river is the common boundary. The present study has tried to discern the role of international riverine borders as a limiting factor of their dynamics from a geomorphological point of view. In this context, the main objective of this research is to assess how land cover in the floodplain has been affected by river dynamics along a border by analysing a 160-km-long reach of the Aras River, which is the natural frontier between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, over the last 35 years (i.e., 1984–2019). Landsat images from 1984 to 2019 have been used to assess land cover changes in a floodplain buffer using Support Vector Machine algorithms and geomorphological changes through indexes such as the River Network Change Index, Channel Mobility Index, Sinuosity index, and Bank retreat index. The results show that active channel has mainly experienced a narrowing process during the study period, with a narrowing rate of 2.05 m/year. In addition, the average value of the River Network Channel Index (−2.45 m/year) reveals that lateral deposition and narrowing were the main processes occurring within the study reach. Channel displacement toward the non-Iranian part was more prominent, being around 27 m on average along the whole study reach which may cause new problems and conflicts that conditions the border situation. In the whole study period, the succession category showed a higher rate of increase in comparison with rejuvenation. Stabilization of surfaces prevailed, with most of the area maintaining the same type during the study period. Regarding land cover types, artificialization appears to be the most prominent transition that express the Aras River, and specifically the floodplain buffer zone, has been strongly affected by human pressure, with farmland activities, urbanization, and damming being the most important types. The key to this habitat degradation comes from the management with irrigation purposes of large reservoirs that directly or indirectly would cause most of the changes detected. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Optimizing Architectures For Multi Mission Archives
PY  - 2011
AB  - Data management systems for new missions are often the end of the chain for design and an area that was in earlier days underestimated. Thanks to the visionaries of our times and measurable increases in science user bandwidth, the value of building a robust archive system is now seen to provide a critical capability for producing newer and greater science. Throughout the astronomical community, teams of scientists and engineers are focusing on how we can build optimized architectures to support multiple missions, both space-based and ground, local and distributed. At Space Telescope Science Institute, such a team is using the successful foundation of the Hubble Space Telescope archive, incorporating lessons learned into the design and development of the James Webb Space Telescope data management systems, and unifying the MAST public science archive with the operational mission archives. The process of optimizing the architecture components combine the resource efficiency of an internal storage cloud while increasingly leveraging collaborative efforts for shared community development of archive and data processing technology, such as the standard protocols and data models developed by the international Virtual Observatory.

TI  - Migratory Routes Of Short-Tailed Albatrosses: Use Of Exclusive Economic Zones Of North Pacific Rim Countries And Spatial Overlap With Commercial Fisheries In Alaska
JO  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2007
AB  - We conducted a satellite tracking study of the endangered short-tailed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus) to determine post-breeding season distribution, the amount of time spent within exclusive economic zones of Pacific Rim countries, and assess factors affecting spatial and temporal overlap with commercial fisheries in Alaska. We obtained 6709 locations for 14 albatrosses (131-808 locations and 51-138 days of tracking per bird). Albatrosses ranged widely throughout the North Pacific Rim, spending the majority of time within the exclusive economics zones of Japan, Russia (Kuril Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula), and the United States (Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, Alaska). We found evidence for gender and age-related differences in distribution and, therefore, potential interaction with regional fisheries. Overall, albatrosses spent the greatest proportion of time within the Alaska exclusive economic zone. Within Alaska, albatrosses occurred most frequently in fishery management zones that encompassed the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, and south of the Alaska Peninsula. Short-tailed albatrosses had the greatest potential overlap with fisheries that occurred along continental shelf break and slope regions, e.g., longlining for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), where albatrosses occurred most often. Some birds, however, also made frequent excursions onto the extensive Bering Sea shelf, suggesting significant potential for interactions with the large-scale walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) fisheries. Alaskan longline fishing fleets have been proactive in using seabird deterrent devices, however, our data further emphasize that such efforts beyond the Alaska exclusive economic zone would provide a greater conservation benefit for this species.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Nightlights To Map Societal Exposure To Hydrometeorological Hazards
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2015
AB  - This study used remotely sensed maps of nightlights to investigate the etiology of increasing disaster losses from hydrometeorological hazards in a data-scarce area. We explored trends in the probability of occurrence of hazardous events (extreme rainfall) and exposure of the local population as components of risk. The temporal variation of the spatial distribution of exposure to hydrometeorological hazards was studied using nightlight satellite imagery as a proxy. Temporal (yearly) and spatial (1 km) resolution make them more useful than official census data. Additionally, satellite nightlights can track informal (unofficial) human settlements. The study focused on the Samala River catchment in Guatemala. The analyses of disasters, using DesInventar Disaster Information Management System data, showed that fatalities caused by hydrometeorological events have increased. Such an increase in disaster losses can be explained by trends in both: (i) catchment conditions that tend to lead to more frequent hydrometeorological extremes (more frequent occurrence of days with wet conditions); and (ii) increasing human exposure to hazardous events (as observed by amount and intensity of nightlights in areas close to rivers). Our study shows the value of remote sensing data and provides a framework to explore the dynamics of disaster risk when ground data are spatially and temporally limited. © 2015 by the authors.

TI  - Benefits Of High Resolution Pm2.5 Prediction Using Satellite Maiac Aod And Land Use Regression For Exposure Assessment: California Examples
JO  - Environmental Science and Technology
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study estimated annual average ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at 1 km resolution using satellite Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD), land use parameters, and meteorology in California for the year 2016 (cross-validation R2 = 0.73 (site-based) and 0.81 (observation-based)). Using these high-resolution PM2.5 estimates, regionally varying urban enhancements of PM2.5 concentrations, 1.43-2.77 μg/m3 (23.9-36.2%), were identified in the densely populated air basins of San Francisco Bay Area, San Joaquin Valley, and South Coast. On the other hand, within-urban PM2.5 variability was found to be 31.4-35.6% of between-urban variability across California. However, this pattern was not consistent from region to region, even showing higher within-urban variability (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area). In addition, satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations were statistically significantly associated with demographic factors (i.e., % people of color, % poverty, and % low education) with the strongest positive association with % people of color (1.05 and 2.72 μg/m3 increases per interquartile range (IQR) and range increases, respectively). The fine-scale PM2.5 estimates enabled the assessment of long-term PM2.5 exposures for all populations particularly benefiting rural populations and socially vulnerable populations widely distributed in each urban area. This study provided evidence of regionally varying exposure misclassification that would arise without accounting for rural and within-urban exposure variabilities.

JO  - IEEE ACCESS
PY  - 2023
AB  - The comprehensive carrying capacity of land is a key indicator for judging the sustainable development of nature and economy. Conducting comprehensive studies on this land capacity can provide the government with valuable information for decision-making. To divide and utilize land in a more reasonable and scientific manner, this study constructed an evaluation model based on the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms. The objective is to establish a more precise evaluation model and conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of the indicators. Based on the experimental results, it can be concluded that the carrying capacity of all five systems increased between 2014 and 2022. System Dexhibited the fastest increase in carrying capacity, with a growth rate of 58.43\%, while system R recorded a growth rate of 46.29\%. The difference in data before and after spatial processing in a certain region was analyzed: the average error of the five regions was relatively small, indicating that the processed values can accurately express spatial visualization information. The accuracy of Random forest support vector machine evaluation model is higher than that of support vector machine, which verifies the optimization effect of Random forest algorithm on support vector machine. In the comparative experiment of four models, each error evaluation parameter from the constructed evaluation module was superior to those from other models. These results illustrate the superior applicability of the proposed research model in terms of comprehensive land bearing capacity. The study optimized the evaluation model for comprehensive carrying capacity of land. This model proposes countermeasures and suggestions for the assessment of land carrying capacity and provides decision-making references for the protection and development of land resources.

TI  - Molecular Analysis Of Genetic Diversity And Population Genetic Structure In Ephedra Foliata: An Endemic And Threatened Plant Species Of Arid And Semi-Arid Regions Of India
JO  - PHYSIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF PLANTS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Studies on the genetic diversity and structure in endangered and threatened species are of utmost importance to design and promote effective conservation and management programs. Ephedra foliata, an endemic and threatened species growing naturally in arid and semi-arid regions of north western India, was investigated to estimate genetic variability and population structure using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and directed amplification of mini-satellite DNA (DAMD) markers. Twenty-five (ISSR 15; DAMD 10) markers produced 449 fragments, of which 382 were polymorphic in nature, revealing 84.59\% polymorphism. ISSR markers revealed higher levels of polymorphism, polymorphic information content, marker index, diversity index and effective multiplex ratio than DAMD markers. Higher values of polymorphism, genetic diversity and Shannon information index at species level than at population level revealed that E. foliata possess high genetic diversity. AMOVA revealed much higher variance within populations than among the populations. The three clustering approaches viz., UPGMA, PCoA, and STRUCTURE, grouped the eleven investigated populations into two clusters revealing two genetic populations and the patterns of clustering of populations was in accordance with their geographic distribution, suggesting that these populations have evolved in response to their local environments. The high level of genetic differentiation (G(ST)=0.31) and moderate gene flow (N-m=1.11) among populations could be due to geographic isolation, regional climatic conditions, over-exploitation and improper seed setting. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first endeavour to estimate genetic diversity and population structure of E. foliata using molecular markers.

TI  - A Method For Spatio-Temporal Process Assessment Of Eco-Geological Environmental Security In Mining Areas Using Catastrophe Theory And Projection Pursuit Model
JO  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - It is a universal problem that the eco-geological environment has been damaged by mineral resources exploitation. The accurate evaluation of eco-geological environmental security (EES) in mining areas is essential for restoring the environment of the mining area. However, a robust approach to obtaining an accurate evaluation of ESS has not yet been produced due to the complex spatio-temporal process of EES. Here, we developed a new method for enabling the quantitative evaluation of the EES spatio-temporal process. The EES evaluation index system of mining areas was established from both natural and anthropogenic aspects. The EES evaluation method was developed by combining the catastrophe theory and projection pursuit model (PPM). Then, with the support of remote sensing (RS) and a geographic information system (GIS), the method was applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal process of EES in Panxi mining area. The bifurcation curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to verify the developed method. The results showed that this method could accurately evaluate the spatio-temporal process of EES in a mining area and could successfully recognise the threshold value to distinguish the safe status and unsafe status. Strong spatio-temporal variations of EES in Panxi area were found, which may be the result of the combined effect of multiple factors (e.g. mineral resource exploitation, soil erosion, and ecological restoration). In summary, the combination of catastrophe theory and PPM with RS and GIS to quantitatively evaluate the spatio-temporal process of EES in mining areas is a robust method.

JO  - Proceedings, 33rd International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment, ISRSE 2009
PY  - 2009
AB  - Global declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services have triggered national and international agreements to halt and reverse these trends (e.g. the Convention on Biological Diversity's target of achieving a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010). These agreements have highlighted the need for monitoring systems which accurately describe the conditions and trends of biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as the drivers of change. GEOSS aims to contribute to these needs in the ecosystems and biodiversity benefit areas. We demonstrate the benefits of GEOSS in the monitoring and assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services using a case study from a semi-arid biodiversity hotspot in South Africa. Using data poor (non-GEOSS) and data rich (GEOSS) scenarios we highlight the substantial differences found in biodiversity and ecosystem service condition. We link these findings to the need for careful and well informed management of ecosystems in semi-arid regions. We conclude with a summary of the costs and benefits of improved data.

TI  - A Crop And Range Alert System In The Us Northern Great Plains
PY  - 2003
AB  - The Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium has developed a crop and range alert system to provide farmers, ranchers, land managers from the Native American Community, government agencies and non-governmental organizations with frequent and near real time remote sensing data to enable decisions that both maximize the producer's income and protect the environment. The project, started in 1999, includes the establishment of a learning community network of end users, fast delivery of data to remote locations, applications development and training. More than a hundred and fifty end users and research scientists participated in this learning group in which information is shared in all directions. Over fifty end users were connected via high-bandwidth satellite link to a central distribution system at the University of North Dakota. They received and shared products derived from AVHRR, MODIS, Landsat, IKONOS and aerial platforms. A number of practical applications were developed for precision farming, such as zone-based nitrogen management, stress detection, spray drift detection, and for rangeland management, such as weed detection, livestock carrying capacity, and livestock field rotations. Several instances of cost savings and higher earnings occurred. More importantly, the imagery use resulted in lesser use of chemicals in farming and ranching, leading to environmental benefits.

TI  - Spatial Prediction Of Soil Salinity Based On The Google Earth Engine Platform With Multitemporal Synthetic Remote Sensing Images
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurately analyzing the spatial distribution of salinity at the regional scale is crucial for regional sustainable development. Currently, there are no reliable approaches for mapping salinity due to the substantial spatial variability of soil salinity. However, remote sensing technology has been successfully used to monitor soil properties in various locations. This research investigates an approach to choose the most appropriate remote sensing time window using a cloud computing platform and synthesizes multitemporal remote sensing images for high spatial resolution digital mapping of salinization at the regional scale. The research site for this experiment is the Werigan-Kuqa Oasis in Xinjiang, China. In the first stage, we screen the Landsat-8 surface reflectance datasets for four-time windows: April-October, May-September, June-August multitemporal, and July single -date images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. Then, we synthesize images based on mini-mum, maximum, mean, and median values and construct multiple spectral indices. We completed model training and digital mapping in the second stage using a geemap. For the first time, we used geemap to integrate a local scikit-learn machine learning library with GEE to train a machine learning model. Next, we performed salinity prediction and mapping based on the best data set. This study demonstrates that (1) Various environmental variables contribute differently to modeling in the same time window. Additionally, these variables exhibit variation across different time windows. However, certain indices, including clay index (CLEX), near infrared (NIR), difference vegetation index (DVI), carbonate index (CAEX), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), canopy response salinity (CRSI), and elevation, demonstrate stable contributions across different time windows. (2) Employing GEE to choose the suitable time window for synthesizing remote sensing images has a better pre-diction effect compared to single-date image prediction accuracy. Through experimental comparison, the best time window is May-September. (3) The mean synthesis approach from May to September exhibits the best performance in the model, while the median synthesis approach exhibits stable performance in the other two individual time windows. (4) Combining scikit-learn with GEE using Geemap improves model optimization and enhances the mapping performance. This study broadens the application of GEE in soil mapping and improves salinity prediction using multitemporal synthetic pictures with time frames.

TI  - Resource Selection Function Models As Tools For Regional Conservation Planning For Northern Goshawk In Utah
JO  - Studies in Avian Biology
PY  - 2006
AB  - Because the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentiles) has a relatively large home range size and low density, data on regional-scale habitat configuration is a critical element of conservation planning for the species. We built a resource-selection-function model to predict goshawk occurrence based on 565 nest-site locations surveyed from 1992-2002 on USDA Forest Service lands throughout Utah. Potential explanatory variables included regional-scale geographic information system (GIS) data on vegetation type, MODIS satellite imagery metrics, topography, climate, and road density. The final model included variables for the tasseled-cap indices of brightness, greenness, and wetness derived from satellite imagery, elevation, slope, aspect, and coefficients for eight vegetation classes. Habitat variables show greater predictive power at the scale of a core or post-fledgling area (∼ 1.7 km2) scale than at stand or home range scales. The model had an area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.874, indicating a useful to highly accurate model. Comparison using a separate validation data set of the performance of the RSF model and an expert-based ranking of the habitat value of potential vegetation types showed that both models were significant predictors of goshawk distribution, with a slight advantage to the RSF model. We compared predicted goshawk habitat distribution with that of other biodiversity targets incorporated in an ecoregional plan for the Utah high plateaus region. RSF values for goshawk were positively correlated with habitat value for wolf (Canis lupus) and black bear (Ursus americanus) but negatively correlated with rare plant locations. Use of these modeling techniques may strengthen currently planned national goshawk surveys by allowing assessment of regional habitat distribution and stratification of primary and secondary habitat across multiple land ownerships and jurisdictions.

TI  - Sex And Size Influence The Spatiotemporal Distribution Of White Sharks, With Implications For Interactions With Fisheries And Spatial Management In The Southwest Indian Ocean
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Human activities in the oceans increase the extinction risk of marine megafauna. Interventions require an understanding of movement patterns and the spatiotemporal overlap with threats. We analysed the movement patterns of 33 white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) satellite-tagged in South Africa between 2012 and 2014 to investigate the influence of size, sex and season on movement patterns and the spatial and temporal overlap with longline and gillnet fisheries and marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a hidden Markov model to identify 'resident' and 'transient' movement states and investigate the effect of covariates on the transition probabilities between states. A model with sex, total length and season had the most support. Tagged sharks were more likely to be in a resident state near the coast and a transient state away from the coast, while the probability of finding a shark in the transient state increased with size. White sharks moved across vast areas of the southwest Indian Ocean, emphasising the need for a regional management plan. White sharks overlapped with longline and gillnet fisheries within 25\% of South Africa's Exclusive Economic Zone and spent 15\% of their time exposed to these fisheries during the study period. The demersal shark longline fishery had the highest relative spatial and temporal overlap, followed by the pelagic longline fishery and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shark nets and drumlines. However, the KZN shark nets and drumlines reported the highest white shark catches, emphasising the need to combine shark movement and fishing effort with reliable catch records to assess risks to shark populations accurately. White shark exposure to shark nets and drumlines, by movement state, sex and maturity status, corresponded with the catch composition of the fishery, providing support for a meaningful exposure risk estimate. White sharks spent significantly more time in MPAs than expected by chance, likely due to increased prey abundance or less disturbance, suggesting that MPAs can benefit large, mobile marine megafauna. Conservation of white sharks in Southern Africa can be improved by implementing non-lethal solutions to beach safety, increasing the observer coverage in fisheries, and continued monitoring of movement patterns and existing and emerging threats.

TI  - Dual-Branch Dense Residual Network For Hyperspectral Imagery Classification
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification is an essential task in remote sensing. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to HSI has achieved significant improvement compared with the traditional machine learning approaches. However, three main issues still exist in applying CNN. First, excessively increasing the number of layers in CNN will hamper the convergence of network. Second, most existing methods ignore the correlated information among different layers. Third, there still exist challenges when jointly extracting spectral and spatial features. To address these problems and improve the performance, we propose a novel dual-branch dense residual network (DRN), where one branch based on 1D convolution is used to extract the spectral features, the other branch based on 2D convolution is used to extract the spatial features, which effectively make use of the complementary benefits of the spectral and spatial information. Moreover, DRN utilized in each branch is designed to ease the training procedure of network by residual units, and the dense structure is introduced to fuse the information of different convolution layers. We conducted experiments on four well-known hyperspectral imagery datasets, i.e. Indian Pines, Pavia University, Salinas and Pavia Centre. The promising experimental results demonstrate that our dual-branch dense residual network achieved superior classification performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Reframing Child Protection: A Response To A Constant Crisis Of Confidence In Child Protection
JO  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
PY  - 2011
AB  - Child protection systems appear to be in a continual crisis of confidence. They get criticised for not doing enough to protect some children, whilst at the same time being criticised for being too intrusive or not managing demand. This constant balancing act drives almost continual reforms, none of which appear to reduce further crises of confidence. The central issue facing tertiary child protection systems stems from their function as makers of sometimes highly uncertain risk screening decisions. Uncertainty leads to errors; false positives and false negatives. Two recurring issues challenging child protection agencies are concerns about these errors. Fears about doing too much are concerns about false positives and fears of doing too little are concerns about false negatives. The need to address both issues within the context of uncertain high stakes decision making, in a highly risk intolerant environment leads to poorly formed sentinel event driven policy that in turn leads to organisational fragility. A decision outcome-based performance model based on Signal Detection Theory provides indicators that explicitly outline the link between these two strategic issues facing child protection systems. This has improved dialogue, understanding and support from sponsors. It has led an informed focus on improving decision making and stabilisation of decision thresholds. It demonstrates that Child protection systems are in fact very responsive and do perform well in their decision making (risk screening) function. Social work decision makers provide value in their decision making in spite of highly uncertain decisions to make. Child protection systems do not need reform, they need to be "reframed" to better understand true performance and so avoid poorly informed reactive policy responses to the genuine challenges that they face.

TI  - Resource Of Involvement As A Psychological Characteristic Of The Correspondence Degree Between A Person And The Educational Environment
JO  - SIBIRSKIY PSIKHOLOGICHESKIY ZHURNAL-SIBERIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
PY  - 2021
AB  - The article deals with the problem of student engagement in the modern educational space. Based on the analysis of the works of Russian and foreign authors, it is shown that engagement is considered as a process, as condition, as a mechanism, as a situation, as an investment of time and energy in the performed activity. There are also various approaches to understanding the structure of engagement, its types, forms, levels, indicators and diagnostic criteria. The most studied is the behavioral side of engagement, the least studied are the mechanisms of the formation of involvement and its management. The authors proposed a systemic anthropological psychology as a methodological basis for the study of student engagement, the foundations of which were laid in the works of Tomsk scientists (V.E. Klochko, E.V. Galazhinsky, O.M. Krasnoryadtseva, O.V. Lukyanov). In this vein, the concordance between the person and the environment is considered as the main mechanism for the formation of engagement. The measure of compliance is the "resource of engagement" of a person, which includes instrumental and value and meaning characteristics. The instrumental component includes various aspects of self- regulation of activity in a changing environment, the value and meaning component is the value and meaning dimension of the objective conditions of activity. The resource of engagement determines the fundamental possibility of including a person in an environment with specific characteristics. The authors conducted an empirical study of the "resource of engagement" of students of two large universities in the Russian Far East; the sample consisted of 498 people. As a result of the factor analysis of the data, the dimensions of the concordance between the student and the educational environment were identified. These are subjective disorganization of activity (impossibility of performing activities in an environment with the specific parameters); flexibility and readiness for change (orientation towards activities in a changing environment); willingness to take responsibility (focus on own forces and resources); result orientation (experience of pleasure in achieving specific results); willingness to work in conditions of uncertainty; selfishness (self-dependence and focus on gaining benefits); focus on the labor process (without taking into account its goals and working conditions). For each option, the directions of psychological assistance aimed at increasing the academic and social involvement of students in the educational space are determined.

The rapid development and deep integration of the two subjects have made it possible to automatic and intelligent process the massive, complex and diverse remote sensing datasets. It has been widely used in many areas, such as resources monitoring, urban planning, disaster assessment, etc. With the development of the remote sensing and computing power, change detection is also evolving. This paper mainly analyzes and summarizes the current change detection methods from the perspectives of geometry and semantics. We focus on the utilization of geometric information and the feature fusion method of deep neural networks. Furthermore, the paper provides a summary of open datasets derived from different sensors, along with information related to change detection. Finally, we point out the challenges of the change detection and the future trends of the area are summarized and prospected. © 2022 SinoMaps Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bikeshare Destination Choices And Accessibility Among Disadvantaged Communities
JO  - Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - There is a lack of understanding of trip destination choices and behaviors for bikeshare users from disadvantaged communities, which are usually underrepresented in bikeshare users’ profiles. Consequently, this study develops a competing destination model to analyze the spatial patterns of choice parameters of bikeshare trips. This research highlights the fact that areas with improved accessibility (i.e., the capability to access different mobility services and technologies, and/or to reach key destinations/opportunities) are more likely to attract bikeshare trips. Among user types (i.e., annual members, day-pass users), annual members from disadvantaged areas are more likely to travel longer distances to other areas that offer more services and opportunities. However, these users are more sensitive to the extra charge levied after the 30-minute grace trip time. This study provides practical suggestions towards designing equitable bikeshare systems to make the social benefits of bikeshare available to all. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Time For Tools: A Review On Geospatial Tools And Their Role In Co-Management
JO  - CANADIAN GEOGRAPHIES-GEOGRAPHIES CANADIENNES
PY  - 2020
AB  - The overall goal of this study was to conduct an extensive literature review to characterize how geospatial tools are being applied in co-management contexts globally. This was accomplished through two objectives: (i) to investigate the use and applications of geospatial tools in cases of natural resource co-management; and (ii) to identify benefits and challenges associated with the use of these technologies. A total of 26 articles met the inclusion criteria for review; these encompassed a range of contexts, but were predominantly focused on co-management of fisheries, protected areas, and forests. Case studies were analyzed through the lens of four tool-based categories: participatory mapping, spatial data collection, remote sensing, and modelling. Findings suggest a wide range of applications, demonstrating the versatility of these tools including those used to measure the efficacy of co-management. Frequently cited geospatial tool benefits included identifying space-use patterns, determining the state of resources, capacity building, and monitoring change over time. Challenges with geospatial tools included issues of scale and generalization, data uncertainty, incomplete or poor data, and lack of trust. A primary conclusion from this study is that geospatial tools tend to be used in a participatory fashion, thereby contributing to key elements of co-management such as trust building and knowledge co-production.

TI  - Linking River Sediment Arsenic To Catchment Spatial Attributes In Agricultural Landscapes
JO  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
PY  - 2022
AB  - Understanding of the sources and processes involved in the heavy metal accumulation in river sediments is important for measuring the risks associated with human exposure. Hence, an integrated modeling approach was designed to study the linkage between landscape-related natural and anthropogenic features and high arsenic levels at the outlet of six catchments on the Ghareh-Ajagh River, central Iran. Sediment arsenic levels were measured in 8 months from October 2018 to November 2019 when the river sediment and water conditions were stable and ranged from 16.3 to 78.5 mg/kg. Monthly catchment-level agricultural areas were extracted from Landsat 8-OLI images. Predictive variables included NDVI values; area and spatial patterns of agriculture measured using four landscape metrics of NP, PD, MPS, and ENN; length and slope of the streams extended from main agricultural areas to the catchment outlet; and four hydrologic soil groups. The best-fitted multiple regression model (r2 = 0.763, p≤ 0.05) with the Akaike information criteria of 105.07 was developed using stream length, soil group C, and area and PD of agricultural areas. Results showed that sediment arsenic levels increase with increasing quantity and density of agricultural activities that were close to the river outlet and increasing proportion of silty loam or loamy soils but are relatively less dependent on agricultural structural patterns. These insights are helpful to inform policy decisions regarding the processes involved in river contamination in central Iran. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Debris Failure Susceptibility Mapping Using Information Value Method
JO  - SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
PY  - 2023
AB  - The heavy rainfall during the rainy season triggers slope failures and causes debris failure and runouts in hilly regions. During the monsoon period, the flooding conditions and debris failures caused huge damage to the properties, roads, and bridges in the Rampur sub-division, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh (H.P.), India. So, it is necessary to prepare a debris failure susceptibility map for the region for planning and management of disaster. The aim of this study is to prepare a debris failure susceptibility map for the Rampur sub-division in Himachal Pradesh (H.P.) province in India. A statistical approach i.e. Info value is used to prepare the debris failure susceptibility map in geographic information system (GIS). Nine causative factors responsible for the occurrence of debris failures were identified i.e. slope, aspect, relative relief, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, drainage density, distance from roads, and faults and land use of the region. A landslide inventory containing more than 400 debris slides, debris failure, and subsidence events is prepared using previous literature, news items, and inventories. The weightage to each factor and sub-factor is assigned using the information value method. The debris failure susceptibility map is prepared by overlaying the weighted layers of causative factors. The debris failure susceptibility map is divided into four categories based on the debris failure susceptibility index (DFSI). The debris failure susceptibility index varies from - 8.072 to 4.246. The results of the study can be used by planners and engineers for planning and mitigation of debris failures in the study area.

TI  - Creation Of A Comprehensive Global Space Risk Scale (Srs)
JO  - Journal of Space Safety Engineering
PY  - 2018
AB  - There would be value in developing, on a global and systematic basis, what might be called a Space Risk Scale (SRS). Such a scale might be broken down into the six major categories of: (i) Public Launch and Re-entry Safety; (ii) Crew on Board Safety; (iii) Environmental Protection; (iv) Ground Personnel Safety; (v) Space Traffic Management (including the Protozone); and (vi) Cosmic Threats and Planetary Defense. Through liaison and risk updating this could be internationally agreed and applied on an on-going basis. Such as global Space Risk Scale (SRS) could aid scientists, engineers and policy makers in understanding and calibrating the many safety risks that are associated with space-based activities that could also include quite diverse public hazards such as cosmic threats, orbital debris, environmental pollution, or in-orbit or sub-orbital collisions. This is not the same as the European proposal to develop a systematic way to establish a so-called “zero space risk impact for space missions.” It is, however, a similar concept of having countries and commercial organizations agree to a process for objective risk assessments [1]. Going forward, organizations such as the IAASS might be asked to develop risk assessments for all types of space projects. The prime values of the SRS would be to allow: (i) legislative bodies as well as political and business leaders to assess the likely success of varying types of space projects; (ii) help insurance companies to assess coverage of space projects; (iii) create a means for objective risk assessment; and (iv) help various types of space projects to be engineered or re-designed to be safer. © 2017 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety

TI  - Remote Detection Of Varying Water Storage In Relation To Surfacial Temperature Of Aral Sea
JO  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
PY  - 2019
AB  - Lake monitoring by remote sensing is of significant importance to understanding the lake and ambient ecological and environmental processes. In particular, whether lake water storage variation could predict lake surfacial temperature or vice versa has long fascinated the research community, in that it would greatly benefit the monitoring missions and scientific interpretation of the lake change processes. This study attempted to remotely detect the dynamics of the Aral Sea and pursue the relationships between varying lake water storage attributes and surface water temperature by using MODIS LST (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Surface Temperature) 8-day composite products, satellite altimeter data, and actual meteorological measurements. Their associations with lake Surface Water Temperatures (SWT) were then analyzed. Results showed the lake water surface areas and elevations of the North Aral Sea tended to increasing trend from 2001 (2793.0 km(2), 13.6 m) to 2015 (6997.8 km(2), 15.9 m), while those of the South Aral Sea showed a decreasing trend during 2001 (20 434.6 km(2), 3.9 m) and 2015 (3256.1 km(2), 0.9 m). In addition, the annual daytime and nighttime lake SWT both decreased in the North Aral Sea, while only the daytime SWT in the South Aral Sea exhibited an increase, indicating a rising deviation of diurnal temperatures in the South Aral Sea during the past 15 yr. Moreover, a lower correlation was found between variations in the daytime SWT and storage capacity in the South Aral Sea (R-2 = 0.33; P < 0.05), no fair correlations were tested between lake water storage and daytime SWT in the North Aral Sea nor between lake water storage and nighttime SWT in either part of the sea. These results implied that climate change, if any at least during the research period, has no significant effects on lake dynamics over the two sectors of the Aral Sea with anthropogenic disturbances. However, climate change and human activities may overlap to explain complex consequences in the lake storage variations. Our results may provide a reference for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of lakes, increasing understanding of the lake water storage changes in relation to the lake SWT, which may benefit the ecological management of the Aral Sea region, in the effort to face the likely threats from climate change and human activities to the region.

TI  - Methane Emission Measurements From The Oil And Gas Supply Chain And Their Policy Implications
JO  - International Gas Union World Gas Conference Papers
PY  - 2018
AB  - In 2012, Environmental Defense Fund, an international nonprofilt organization, spearheaded the largest, collaborative methane research project, a series of studies over five years that examined methane emissions from the oil/natural gas (O/NG) supply chain in the US. The project aims to collect empirical data using scientific methods and approaches to better understand O/NG emissions. More than 50 O/NG firms from across the value chain participated in the series and provided site access, technical input, and funding to academic researchers leading the discrete study efforts to measure methane emissions system-wide. Three key findings are critical to understanding and addressing current patterns of methane emissions. First, methane emissions are significant across the supply chain, with the production sector responsible for the greatest share. Second, the widespread, unpredictable emitters are a key contributor. Third, traditional emission inventories frequently underestimate emissions and data can be improved with airborne measurements as well as mobile surveys and satellite derived data.

TI  - Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol: A Commercial System-Of-Systems To Incentivize Forest Restoration And Management
JO  - PeerJ
PY  - 2020
AB  - Forest carbon sequestration offsets are methodologically uncertain, comprise a minor component of carbon markets and do not effectively slow deforestation. The objective of this study is to describe a commercial scale in situ measurement approach for determination of net forest carbon sequestration projects, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM, to address forest carbon market uncertainties. In contrast to protocols that rely on limited forest mensuration, growth simulation and exclusion of CO2 data, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM is based on standardized methods for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy covariance, a meteorological approach integrating forest carbon fluxes. NEE is used here as the basis for quantifying the first of its kind carbon financial products. The DMFCP differentiates physical, project and financial carbon within a System-of-SystemsTM (SoS) network architecture. SoS sensor nodes, the Global Monitoring PlatformTM (GMP), housing analyzers for CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2,13CO214CO2) and greenhouse gases are deployed across the project landscape. The SoS standardizes and automates GMP measurement, uncertainty and reporting functions creating diverse forest carbon portfolios while reducing cost and investment risk in alignment with modern portfolio theory. To illustrate SoS field deployment and operation, published annual NEE data for a tropical (Ankasa Park, Ghana, Africa) and a deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA) are used to forecast carbon revenue. Carbon pricing scenarios are combined with historical in situ NEE annual time-series to extrapolate pre-tax revenue for each project applied to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares) of surrounding land. Based on carbon pricing of $5 to $36 per ton CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) and observed NEE sequestration rates of 0.48 to 15.60 tCO2eq acre−1 yr−1, pre-tax cash flows ranging from $230,000 to $16,380,000 across project time-series are calculated, up to 5× revenue for contemporary voluntary offsets, demonstrating new economic incentives to reverse deforestation. The SoS concept of operation and architecture, with engineering development, can be extended to diverse gas species across terrestrial, aquatic and oceanic ecosystems, harmonizing voluntary and compliance market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming. The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of invalidation intrinsic to estimation-based protocols such as the Climate Action Reserve and the Clean Development Mechanism that do not observe molecular CO2 to calibrate financial products. Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, constrained by Kyoto Protocol era processes, will benefit from NEE measurement avoiding unsupported claims of emission reduction, fraud, and forest conservation policy failure.

TI  - Cost And Outcome Of A Community-Based Paediatric Hearing Screening Programme In Rural India With Application Of Tele-Audiology For Follow-Up Diagnostic Hearing Assessment
JO  - International Journal of Audiology
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objective: This study evaluated the cost and outcome of a community-based hearing screening programme in which village health workers (VHWs) screened children in their homes using a two-step DPOAE screening protocol. Children referred in a second screening underwent tele diagnostic ABR testing in a mobile tele-van using satellite connectivity or at local centre using broadband internet at the rural location. Design: Economic analysis was carried out to estimate cost incurred and outcome achieved for hearing screening, follow-up diagnostic assessment and identification of hearing loss. Two-way sensitivity analysis determined the most beneficial cost-outcome. Study sample: 1335 children under 5 years of age underwent screening by VHWs. Results: Nineteen of the 22 children referred completed the tele diagnostic evaluation. Five children were identified with hearing loss. The cost-outcomes were better when using broadband internet for tele-diagnostics. The use of least expensive human resources and equipment yielded the lowest cost per child screened (Rs.1526; $23; €21). When follow-up expenses were thus maximised, the cost per child was reduced considerably for diagnostic hearing assessment (Rs.102,065; $1532; €1368) and for the cost per child identified (Rs.388,237; $5826; €5204). Conclusion: Settings with constrained resources can benefit from a community-based programme integrated with tele diagnostics. © 2018 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

TI  - Variability In Net Primary Production And Carbon Storage In Biomass Across Oregon Forests - An Assessment Integrating Data From Forest Inventories, Intensive Sites, And Remote Sensing
JO  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2005
AB  - We used a combination of data from USDA Forest Service inventories, intensive chronosequences, extensive sites, and satellite remote sensing. to estimate biomass and net primary production (NPP) for the forested region of western Oregon. The study area was divided into four ecoregions differing widely in climatic conditions and management regime. The forest age distributions (as derived from inventory data) differed by ecozone with fewer old stands in the Coast Range and the East Cascades, and a relatively uniform distribution of ages from 0 to 815 in the Cascade Mountains. Age distributions also differed by land ownership, with fewer old stands on non-federal lands than on national forest lands. Estimated biomass increased rapidly in early stand development and tended to stabilize after about 200 years. Peak biomass in the semi-arid East Cascades was about one-third that of the other ecoregions (median biomass at asymptote similar to 9 and similar to 25 kg C m(-2), respectively). The timing and magnitude of maximum net primary production also varied by ecoregion, with the high productivity Coast Range forests reaching a maximum NPP before 30 years of age (median similar to 1 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), and the low productivity East Cascades reaching a maximum NPP between 80 and 100 years (median similar to 0.3 kg C m(-2) y(-1)). Productivity was generally lower in older stands with the exception of the East Cascades ecoregion where, contrary to the paradigm of age-related decline in forest growth, the oldest stands had the highest NPR The East Cascades also differed from the other ecoregions in that the proportion of NPP allocated below-round decreased rather than increased with stand age. This study demonstrates the value of combining data from intensive and extensive measurement sites for improved estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes as well as improved parameterization of process models used in scaling carbon flux over broad regions.

TI  - Automatic Assessment Of Agro-Environmental Indicators From Remotely Sensed Images Of Tree Orchards And Its Evaluation Using Olive Plantations
JO  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
PY  - 2008
AB  - Key agronomic and environmental characteristics of tree orchards can be automatically assessed from remote sensing images by a computer program named Clustering Assessment" (CLUAS). The aim of this paper is to describe the CLUAS software development and the information generated by CLUAS for selected olive orchards and its validation with ground-truth data. CLUAS works as an add-on of ENVI (R), and operates integrating the digital values (DV) of the neighbouring pixels within a defined range of DV. In the orchards plots trees, other vegetation cover and bare soil were the land uses considered and the range of digital values (BDV) which best define each of them determined. CLUAS provides parameters of each tree, such as the geometric Centre, the number of pixels or area, and the integrated digital values or relative potential yield. CLUAS also characterizes key parameters of tree groves, such as the total area and the number, area and the relative potential productivity of the whole trees; and similarly for the other land uses such as vegetation cover and bare soil. Remote images with spatial resolution from 0.25 to 1.5 m were suitable for olive grove characterization. CLUAS can contribute to the site-specific management of tree groves, providing quantitative information on each tree, small areas of an orchard, or whole orchards. Ground-truth data taken in an olive orchard of about 2 ha at the Experimental Station of Cabra (Cordoba, Spain) in 2004 and 2005 and remote images of the same zone were studied for validation purposes. The wavebands green, NIR (near-infrared), panchromatic and the vegetation indexes normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratiovegetation index (RVI) were selected for olive grove image assessment by CLUAS. The average size of olive trees was similar regardless of the waveband or vegetation index used, varying from about 23.5-26.0 m(2), and significantly interrelated between each other at 99\%. Olive tree area and potential yield estimated by remote sensing were also highly related to the olive tree area estimated on the ground, with significant correlation coefficients at 99\% varying from 0.62 to 0.82 and 0.52 to 0.74 in 2004 and 2005, respectively. On the other hand, olive tree size and potential yield estimated in green, panchromatic, NDVI and RVI images were significantly related to the ground-truth yield with correlation coefficients of around 0.50 in 2004, an "on" year, and of 0.30-0.40 in 2005, an "off"year, respectively.

TI  - Statistical Considerations Of Nonrandom Treatment Applications Reveal Region-Wide Benefits Of Widespread Post-Fire Restoration Action
JO  - Nature Communications
PY  - 2022
AB  - Accurate predictions of ecological restoration outcomes are needed across the increasingly large landscapes requiring treatment following disturbances. However, observational studies often fail to account for nonrandom treatment application, which can result in invalid inference. Examining a spatiotemporally extensive management treatment involving post-fire seeding of declining sagebrush shrubs across semiarid areas of the western USA over two decades, we quantify drivers and consequences of selection biases in restoration using remotely sensed data. From following more than 1,500 wildfires, we find treatments were disproportionately applied in more stressful, degraded ecological conditions. Failure to incorporate unmeasured drivers of treatment allocation led to the conclusion that costly, widespread seedings were unsuccessful; however, after considering sources of bias, restoration positively affected sagebrush recovery. Treatment effects varied with climate, indicating prioritization criteria for interventions. Our findings revise the perspective that post-fire sagebrush seedings have been broadly unsuccessful and demonstrate how selection biases can pose substantive inferential hazards in observational studies of restoration efficacy and the development of restoration theory. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Vegetation Maps Based On Remote Sensing Are Informative Predictors Of Habitat Selection Of Grassland Birds Across A Wetness Gradient
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2015
AB  - Vegetation is a major environmental factor influencing habitat selection in bird species. High resolution mapping of vegetation cover is essential to model the distribution of populations and improve the management of breeding habitats. However, the task is challenging for grassland birds because microhabitat variations relevant at the territory scale cannot be measured continuously over large areas to delineate areas of higher suitability. Remote sensing may help to circumvent this problem. We addressed this issue by using SPOT 5 imagery and phytosociological data. We mapped grassland vegetation in a floodplain using two methods. We (i) mapped the continuous Ellenberg index of moisture and (ii) identified 5 vegetation classes distributed across the wetness gradient. These two methods produced consistent output maps, but they also provided complementary results. Ellenberg index is a valuable proxy for soil moisture while the class approach provided more information about vegetation structure, and possibly trophic resources. In spite of the apparent uniformity of meadows, our data show that birds do not settle randomly along the moisture and vegetation gradients. Overall birds tend to avoid the driest vegetation classes, i.e. the highest grounds. Thus, vegetation maps based on remote sensing could be valuable tools to study habitat selection and niche partition in grassland bird communities. It is also a valuable tool for conservation and habitat management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Movement And Aggregation Of Eastern Hudson Bay Beluga Whales {Delphinapterus Leucas): A Comparison Of Patterns Found Through Satellite Telemetry And Nunavik Traditional Ecological Knowledge
JO  - Arctic
PY  - 2009
AB  - Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) consists of the collective knowledge, experience, and values of subsistence communities, while Western science relies on hypothesis testing to obtain information on natural processes. Both approaches provide important ecological information, but few studies have directly compared the two. We compared information on movements and aggregation of beluga whales obtained from TEK interview records (n = 3253) and satellite telemetry records of 30 whales tagged in eastern Hudson Bay, Canada, using geographic information system (GIS) approaches that allowed common formatting of the data sets. Estuarine centres of aggregation in the summer were evident in both data sets. The intensive use of offshore areas seen in the telemetry data, where 76% of the locations were more than 15 km from mainland Quebec, was not evident in the TEK data, where only 17% of the records indicated offshore locations. Morisita's index of similarity indicated that TEK and telemetry data distributions varied with season, with the highest similarity in winter (0.74). Location and movement data from the telemetry study were limited by small sample size and short tag deployment times, while TEK data were biased by spatial coverage and coastal travel habits. Although the two data sets can provide complementary information, both suffer from weaknesses that need to be acknowledged when these data are adapted for use in resource management. © The Arctic Institute of North America.

TI  - Assessment Of Sagebrush Cover Using Remote Sensing At Multiple Spatial And Temporal Scales
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rangelands occupy a large portion of the Earth's land surface and provide many ecosystem services to human populations around the world. Increasingly, however, the ability of rangelands to continue providing these services is challenged by anthropogenic influence. There is an urgent need to monitor changes in rangelands through time and across large geographic areas. Current field-based methods used to assess and monitor rangelands are limited because of their inability to account for spatial and temporal variation. An alternative approach is presented to assess rangelands using high resolution imagery as enhanced ground samples and multi-spatial remote sensing imagery to quickly, cheaply, and effectively map basic land cover components. High-resolution, ground-based natural color vertical photography captures, in space and time, percent cover of vegetative and abiotic components at the plot level. This imagery maintains a visual history of percent cover allowing other investigators the ability to repeat the observation or use other sampling techniques to extract improved or additional information. These plot-based measures are then linked to airborne or satellite acquired imagery allowing for extrapolation of ground measurements across large landscapes. Linking plot-based measures to remotely sensed imagery can allow for documentation of change across the past 30 years utilizing Landsat imagery. Our process was applied to a sagebrush-steppe landscape in northern Utah with promising results. Extrapolation of percent vegetation cover data extracted from ground-based natural color vertical photography to 1 m resolution lkonos imagery using regression tree analysis resulted in an overall R-2 value of 0.81 while an extrapolation to 30 m Landsat Thematic Mapper resulted in an R-2 of 0.90 using a 5-fold cross-validation. A comparison between independently acquired ground measurements from multiple time intervals showed a moderately strong correlation of R-2 = 0.65 for Landsat Thematic Mapper. This technique has great potential to place land cover change and rangeland health in a contextual perspective that has not been available before. In this way, past management practices can be evaluated for their effectiveness in altering basic cover components of rangelands. With this hindsight, improved management prescriptions can be developed providing a valuable tool in assessing public land grazing allotments for renewal or habitat quality for sensitive wildlife species like greater sage-grouse.

TI  - Site History’s Role In Urban Agriculture: A Case Study In Kisumu, Kenya, And Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
JO  - Land
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) is a widespread practice often considered low-profit, taking place on marginal lands. This is supported by the lack of quantitative data on UA’s contributions to food security and employment, yet contradicted by prevalence and high participation rates. This case study of six UA sites in Kisumu, Kenya and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso explores the relationship between prior land use and current management and soil quality. A soil survey is performed determining the soil macronutrient and soil mineral composition. Agricultural management, ownership, and prior land use are investigated through interviews, satellite imagery, and historic publications. Results show three UA sites predating surrounding urban development, and data on soil nutrient content show that sites likely were chosen for their soil. The three younger sites are smaller and less embedded in the local economy, but soil analysis shows medium-rich to rich agricultural soils. We conclude that one cannot assume that UA is practiced on marginalized soils. Consequently, both value attribution to and the sustainable agricultural management of UA soils must be based on their characteristics, such as mineralogy and nutrient status, to prevent valuable soil resources from being lost. Through this, the more accurate value attribution of UA can be achieved, lending weight to the value attributed to UA by local communities. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Probabilistic Reasoning About Measurements Of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity: Combining Disparate Lines Of Evidence
JO  - Climatic Change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Where policy and science intersect, there are always issues of ambiguous and conflicting lines of evidence. Combining disparate information sources is mathematically complex; common heuristics based on simple statistical models easily lead us astray. Here, we use Bayesian Nets (BNs) to illustrate the complexity in reasoning under uncertainty. Data from joint research at Resources for the Future and NASA Langley are used to populate a BN for predicting equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The information sources consist of measuring the rate of decadal temperature rise (DTR) and measuring the rate of percentage change in cloud radiative forcing (CRF), with both the existing configuration of satellites and with a proposed enhanced measuring system. The goal of all measurements is to reduce uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity. Subtle aspects of probabilistic reasoning with concordant and discordant measurements are illustrated. Relative to the current prior distribution on ECS, we show that after 30 years of observing with the current systems, the 2σ uncertainty band for ECS would be shrunk on average to 73% of its current value. With the enhanced systems over the same time, it would be shrunk to 32% of its current value. The actual shrinkage depends on the values actually observed. These results are based on models recommended by the Social Cost of Carbon methodology and assume a Business as Usual emissions path. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Effects Of Preservation Policy On Land Use Changes In Iranian Northern Zagros Forests
JO  - Land Use Policy
PY  - 2019
AB  - Zagros Forest provides various ecosystem services such as food, timber, water, carbon storage, air purification, wildlife habitat as well as social and cultural benefits for both humans and animals. Due to the economic expansion beginning in the early 1990s in Iran and its resulting desertification, Zagros has lost numerous forests over the last 30 years. To overcome this issue, Zagros Forest Preservation Plan (ZFPP) has been under implementation in Northwestern Iran since 2003 to reduce forest destruction and attract the people's participation. However, it faced shortcomings caused by a variety of factors including insufficient funds, incomplete preservation, and unsuitable organization during implementation. This research aims to study the effect of ZFPP on forest loss in Sardasht County as a representative of Iranian Northern Zagros Forests. A series of Landsat images were used to analyze the forest loss before ZFPP implementation (1993–2002), after 10 years of implementation (2002–2012), and finally after its revision (2012–2016). Land Change Modeler (LCM) was employed to detect land cover changes for land cover prediction in 2024. We used land cover maps between 2002 and 2012 for calibration. We then compared the predicted land cover map from LCM with actual land cover map in 2016 for validation. The results indicated that 3330, 4562, and 1234 ha of forestlands converted to agricultural lands, rangelands, and built-up areas during 1993–2002, 2002–2012, and 2012–2016, with annual deforestation rates of -0.40%, -0.52% and -0.36%, respectively. The highest deforestation rate was observed between 2002 and 2012 because of the destructive effects of population growth. Land cover prediction indicated that per capita forest area would continue to decline while the other land cover uses would continue to grow more severely around the existing agricultural lands and built-up areas in Sardasht until 2024. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ants Provide Biological Control On Tropical Organic Farms Influenced By Local And Landscape Factors
JO  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
PY  - 2020
AB  - Multiple predator species can provide effective biological control of pest insects if predators have complementary effects. This could be the case of predatory ants in species-rich assemblages, such as in the tropics. However, predator assemblages are structured by variation in local and landscape factors. Different spatial scales can affect species interaction and consequently the biological control provided. We investigated ant suppression of pest insects in organic vegetable crops, and the role of local and landscape factors on biological control. We used a sentinel prey assay to determine the effectiveness of ant biological control on 18 organic farms in the Brazilian Federal District. Ants and other predatory groups were sampled on farms to determine natural enemy assemblage composition. Ants were the group that most contributed to the predation rates, and the other predator groups complemented the predation rates exerted by ants. The predation of sentinel prey increased 3.07-fold when ants were present. These results varied with the farming management practices employed. The species richness and occurrence were positively related to the predation rates, indicating that ant species-rich assemblage may be more relevant than single species in providing biological control. The predation exerted by ants and other predators were benefited by the abundance of predators in the landscape. Tree cover and cropped area in the landscape reduced ant predation but increased the predation exerted by other predators, because most ant species we sampled usually occur in open habitats. In conclusion, species-rich assemblages play a central role in providing biological control, and biological control provided by ants and other predators depends on local habitat management and landscape composition and therefore is a scale dependent process.

TI  - Geospatial Characterization Of Deforestation, Fragmentation And Forest Fires In Telangana State, India: Conservation Perspective
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Conservation of biodiversity has been put to the highest priority throughout the world. The process of identifying threatened ecosystems will search for different drivers related to biodiversity loss. The present study aimed to generate spatial information on deforestation and ecological degradation indicators of fragmentation and forest fires using systematic conceptual approach in Telangana state, India. Identification of ecosystems facing increasing vulnerability can help to safeguard the extinctions of species and useful for conservation planning. The technological advancement of satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information System has increased greatly in assessment and monitoring of ecosystem-level changes. The areas of threat were identified by creating grid cells (5 × 5 km) in Geographical Information System (GIS). Deforestation was assessed using multi-source data of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013. The forest cover of 40,746 km2, 29,299 km2, 18,652 km2, 18,368 km2, 18,006 km2, 17,556 km2 and 17,520 km2 was estimated during 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013, respectively. Historical evaluation of deforestation revealed that major changes had occurred in forests of Telangana and identified 1095 extinct, 397 critically endangered, 523 endangered and 311 vulnerable ecosystem grid cells. The fragmentation analysis has identified 307 ecosystem grid cells under critically endangered status. Forest burnt area information was extracted using AWiFS data of 2005 to 2014. Spatial analysis indicates total fire-affected forest in Telangana as 58.9 % in a decadal period. Conservation status has been recorded depending upon values of threat for each grid, which forms the basis for conservation priority hotspots. Of existing forest, 2.1 % grids had severe ecosystem collapse and had been included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 27.2 % in conservation priority hotspot-II and 51.5 % in conservation priority hotspot-III. This analysis complements assessment of ecosystems undergoing multiple threats. An integrated approach involving the deforestation and degradation indicators is useful in formulating the strategies to take appropriate conservation measures. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Mineral Potential Mapping In Central Iran Using Fuzzy Ordered Weighted Averaging Method
JO  - Geophysical Prospecting
PY  - 2015
AB  - The aim of this work is to introduce the application of the fuzzy ordered weighted averaging method as a straightforward knowledge-driven approach to explore porphyry copper deposits in an airborne prospect. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to airborne geophysical (potassium radiometry, magnetometry, and frequency-domain electromagnetic) data, geological layers (fault and host rock zones), and various extracted alteration layers from remote sensing images. The central Iranian volcanic-sedimentary belt in Kerman province of Iran that is located within the Urumieh-Dokhtar (Sahand-Bazman) magmatic arc is chosen for this study. This region has high potential of mineral occurrences, especially porphyry copper, containing some active world-class copper mines such as Sarcheshmeh. Two evidential layers, including the downward continued map and the analytic signal of such filtered magnetic data, are generated to be used as geophysical plausible traces of porphyry copper occurrences. The low values of the resistivity layer acquired from airborne frequency-domain electromagnetic data are also used as an electrical criterion in this study. Four remote sensing evidential layers, including argillic, phyllic, propylitic, and hydroxyl alterations, are extracted from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer images in order to map the altered areas associated with porphyry copper deposits. The Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus images are used to map iron oxide layer. Since potassium alteration is the mainstay of copper alteration, the airborne potassium radiometry data are used. Here, the fuzzy ordered weighted averaging method uses a wide range of decision strategies in order to generate numerous mineral potential/prospectivity maps. The final mineral potential map based upon desired geo-data set indicates adequately matching of high-potential zones with previous working mines and copper deposits. © 2014 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.

TI  - Rainfall Shocks, Cognitive Development And Educational Attainment Among Adolescents In A Drought-Prone Region In Kenya
JO  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
PY  - 2021
AB  - There is growing evidence that early life conditions are important for outcomes during adolescence, including cognitive development and education. Economic conditions at the time children enter school are also important. We examine these relationships for young adolescents living in a low-income drought-prone pastoral setting in Kenya using historical rainfall patterns captured by remote sensing as exogenous shocks. Past rainfall shocks measured as deviations from local long-term averages have substantial negative effects on the cognitive development and educational achievement of girls. Results for the effects of rainfall shocks on grades attained, available for both girls and boys, support that finding. Consideration of additional outcomes suggests the effects of rainfall shocks on education are due to multiple underlying mechanisms including persistent effects on the health of children and the wealth of their households, underscoring the potential value of contemporaneous program and policy responses to such shocks.

TI  - Incorporation Of Net Radiation Model Considering Complex Terrain In Evapotranspiration Determination With Sentinel-2 Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary mechanism of water transformation between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate ET estimation given complex terrain conditions is essential to guide water resource management in mountainous areas. This study is based on the ETWatch model driven by Sentinel-2 remote sensing data at a spatial resolution of 10 m incorporating a net radiation model considering the impact of a complex terrain. We tested our model with two years of data in two regions with a high relief near the Huairou (2020) and Baotianman (2019) weather stations. Regarding the validation results of the ET model, the coefficient of determination (R-2) reached 0.84 in Huairou and 0.86 in Baotianman, while the root mean square error (RMSE) value reached 0.59 mm in Baotianman and 0.82 mm in Huairou. The validation results indicated that the model is applicable in regions with a complex terrain, and the ET results can capture topographic textures. In terms of the slope aspect, the ET value on south-facing slopes is higher than that on north-facing slopes in both study areas. Accurate ET monitoring in mountainous regions with a high relief yields a profound meaning in obtaining a better understanding of the characteristics of heat and water fluxes at different vegetation growth stages and underlying surface types, which can provide constructive suggestions for water management in mountainous areas.

TI  - Decision Tree Classification Based On Fitted Phenology Parameters From Remotely Sensed Vegetation Data
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2014
AB  - Phenology refers to periodic plant life cycle events influenced by climate and other environmental factors, such as sprouting, flowering, fruiting and leaves falling, etc. Different vegetation types have distinct growth characteristics, and phenology can be a good representative parameter to classify vegetation types. Phonological parametric analysis is mainly used to find out significant changes in specific time points and extract corresponding characteristic VI values, by analyzing a time-series vegetation index, e.g., start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of season (LOS), max of EVI (MOE) and amplitude of EVI (AOE). These key phenology parameters can be used to classify vegetation types. Eerguna and Genhe in Hulunbeier city, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were selected as the study area. A double logistic function fitting method was used to smooth the time series MODIS-EVI data. The time range was from the summer of 2011 (DOY=209) to the summer of 2013 (DOY=193), and the total number of images was 46. Then, 100 points of each land cover type (grass, forest, crops, other non-vegetation) were chosen as classification samples. Five key phenological parameters mentioned above were extracted and used to build the decision tree classifier. The overall classification accuracy of the results reached to 73.67%. The results show that vegetation in Hulunbeier northern region had obvious unique features. The season of forest started earliest (145-160 days, DOY, hereinafter), and ended quiet early (250-275 days); the season of grass started slightly later than forest (160-170 days), but the length of season was similar to forest, both were from 90 to 120 days. The season of crops started late and ended early, so the season of crops was short and concentrated, the length of the samples was from 60 to 90 days. The classification achieved better results than MODIS land cover products (66.08%). Except for grass' user accuracy being a little lower, producer accuracy and user accuracy of the 4 kinds of land cover types reached to 79%. The phonological information extracted in this paper had a high consistency with existing research results; it is shown that monitoring phenology based on time-series EVI data was reliable. This research can provide a reference to ecological environment evaluation and agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry production activities in the Hulunbeier northern region.

TI  - Development Of A Gis-Based Model For Predicting Rice Yield
JO  - PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE
PY  - 2014
AB  - Monitoring the growth of rice and forecasting its yield before harvest season is important for crop and food management. Remote sensing images are capable of identifying crop health as well as in predicting its yield. This study was conducted to develop a functional model for predicting rice yield from remotely sensed data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from remote sensing images has been widely-used to monitor crop growth and relate it to crop yield. This study used 16-d composite Terra MODIS NDVI data from December 2008 to April 2009 to predict rice yield in Dingras, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Nine yield prediction models were developed through linear regression analysis (stepwise method) between NDVI and observed yield, among which Model 3 had the highest potential. It can predict yield way ahead before harvesting. The R-2 value of the models ranged 0.36-0.75, which means that about 39-75\% of the yield variability could be explained by the models. The variability between predicted and actual yields are due to factors not considered in the model such as type of soil, varieties planted, weather and other cultural management practices, such as water, nutrient and pest managements used on the standing crop studied.

TI  - Flash Flood Susceptibility Assessment And Zonation Using An Integrating Analytic Hierarchy Process And Frequency Ratio Model For The Chitral District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
JO  - WATER
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pakistan is a flood-prone country and almost every year, it is hit by floods of varying magnitudes. This study was conducted to generate a flash flood map using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) models in the ArcGIS 10.6 environment. Eight flash-flood-causing physical parameters were considered for this study. Five parameters were based on the digital elevation model (DEM), Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), and Sentinel-2 satellite, including distance from the river and drainage density slope, elevation, and land cover, respectively. Two other parameters were geology and soil, consisting of different rock and soil formations, respectively, where both layers were classified based on their resistance against water percolation. One parameter was rainfall. Rainfall observation data obtained from five meteorological stations exist close to the Chitral District, Pakistan. According to its significant importance in the occurrence of a flash flood, each criterion was allotted an estimated weight with the help of AHP and FR. In the end, all the parameters were integrated using weighted overlay analysis in which the influence value of the drainage density was given the highest value. This gave the output in terms of five flood risk zones: very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk, and very low risk. According to the results, 1168 km(2), that is, 8\% of the total area, showed a very high risk of flood occurrence. Reshun, Mastuj, Booni, Colony, and some other villages were identified as high-risk zones of the study area, which have been drastically damaged many times by flash floods. This study is pioneering in its field and provides policy guidelines for risk managers, emergency and disaster response services, urban and infrastructure planners, hydrologists, and climate scientists.

TI  - Assessing Environmental Impacts And Change In Myanmar's Mangrove Ecosystem Service Value Due To Deforestation (2000–2014)
JO  - Global Change Biology
PY  - 2018
AB  - Myanmar is one of the mangrove-richest countries in the world, providing valuable ecosystem services to people. However, due to deforestation driven primarily by agricultural expansion, Myanmar's mangrove forest cover has declined dramatically over the past few decades, while what remains is still under pressure. To support management planning, accurate quantification of mangrove forest cover changes on a national scale is needed. In this study, we quantified Myanmar's mangrove forest cover changes between 2000 and 2014 using remotely sensed data, examined the environmental impacts of such changes, and estimated the changes in the economic values of mangrove ecosystem services in the country. Results indicate that Myanmar had a net mangrove loss of 191,122 ha over the study period. Since 2000, Myanmar has been losing mangrove forest cover at an alarming rate of 14,619 ha/year (2.2%/year). The loss was predominant in Rakhine and Ayeyarwady. The observed mangrove forest cover loss has resulted in decreased evapotranspiration, carbon stock, and tree cover percentage. Due to deforestation, Myanmar also suffered a net loss of 2,397 million US$/year in its mangrove ecosystem service value (i.e. 28.7% decrease from 2000), in which maintenance of fisheries nursery populations and habitat and coastal protection were among those services that were greatly affected. We suggest that intensive reforestation and mangrove protection programs be implemented immediately. Agroforestry and community forestry programs are encouraged in areas that are under immense pressure from paddy field expansion, fuelwood extraction, charcoal production, and fish and shrimp farming activities. Potential alternative sustainable solutions should include intensive government-led private forest plantations or community-owned forest plantations to be developed with care by local farmers, nongovernmental organizations, and business owners. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Combining Artificial Neural Network And Ordinary Kriging To Predict Wetland Soil Organic Carbon Concentration In China's Liao River Basin
JO  - SENSORS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Accurate prediction of wetland soil organic carbon concentration and an understanding of its controlling factors are important for studying regional climate change and wetland carbon cycles; with that knowledge mechanisms can be put in place that are conducive to sustainable ecosystem management for environmental health. In this study, a hybrid approach combining an artificial neural network and ordinary kriging and 103 soil samples at three soil depth ranges (0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm) were used to predict wetland soil organic carbon concentration in China's Liao River Basin. The model evaluation indicated that a combination of artificial neural network and ordinary kriging and limited soil samples achieved good performance in predicting wetland soil organic carbon concentration. Wetland soil organic carbon concentration in the Liao River Basin has apparent spatial and vertical heterogeneities with values decreasing from southeast to northwest and concentrates present mainly in the topsoil (0-30 cm). Mean wetland soil organic carbon concentration values at the three soil depths were 10.43 +/- 0.38, 7.93 +/- 0.25, and 7.61 +/- 0.22 g/kg, respectively, which are smaller than those over other wetland regions in Northeast China. Terrain aspect contributed the most in predicting wetland soil organic carbon concentration at each of the three soil depths, followed by normalized difference vegetation index at 0-30 cm and mean annual precipitation at 30-60 and 60-100 cm. This study provides a framework method and baseline to quantify the soil organic carbon concentration dynamics in response to climatic and anthropogenic drivers.

JO  - Satellite Remote Sensing for Conservation Action: Case Studies from Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems
PY  - 2018
AB  - This chapter finds its rationale in the key ecological role fire plays on ecosystems and biodiversity. In particular, it focuses on the use of satellite information to improve habitat monitoring in protected areas. Conservation practitioners need this information to meet their goals and improve management effectiveness. To address these needs, the European Commission worked in collaboration with conservation institutions and protected areas in Africa to build two systems for the distribution of satellite-based information to support conservation and decision making. The first system, the Fire Monitoring Tool, is a stand-alone web portal which provides near-real time information of fire activity based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The tool provides specific ecological indicators about fire in the world protected areas. Whereas the second system, the eStation, is a network of servers receiving EO-based products, including wildfire, used for protected area ecological assessment, but also national and regional environmental monitoring. The benefits provided by the systems are described in two case studies in Tanzania and Niger. The examples show how park ecologists have improved habitat monitoring and conservation efforts in the protected areas and how this can be repeated in other conservation areas. © Cambridge University Press 2018.

TI  - A Field Survey In Potenza (Southern Italy) For Developing And Testing An Innovative Strategy Of Air Pollution Control On A Local Scale
JO  - WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment
PY  - 2014
AB  - Climate change and air pollution, both on a global and local scale, are two interrelated environmental policy problems, but usually they are studied separately with very different approaches. In a novel context, in which climate change and air quality become two related aspects of the same problem, we believe that it is necessary to carry out novel local strategies for Air Quality Monitoring Networks' (AQMNs) innovation, not only applying analytical optimization procedures of the existing networks, but also introducing advanced in situ devices and using data by remote investigations. Advanced instrumentation allows to evaluate the concentration of specific pollutants and to better characterize the local weather conditions. Remote observations (satellite data and vertical profiles of atmospheric variables) may improve the network effectiveness. In this study we present experimental data observed in the urban area of Potenza (Basilicata, southern Italy) during a field survey. In the same sampling period, we compare data atmospheric pollutants concentrations by AQM network of Potenza with data collected in our experimental site and with a satellite map of CO2. Despite the observation scales being very different, the results are encouraging and we believe that other efforts have to be made; the short-term benefits obtaining from air pollution control and innovation may be as effective as the long-term benefits obtainable through strategic climate change measures. So it is important to develop and to support local integrated strategies, for mitigating air pollution and climate change contemporaneously. © 2014 WIT Press.

TI  - Integration Of Remote Sensing And Gis In Landuse Planning For Sustainable Natural Resource Management Within The Mount Cameroon Region-West African
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2000
AB  - Population growth in developing countries is a key factor to environmental degradation. The mount Cameroon region in West Africa is one of the sites where the equatorial rainforest is disappearing at a fast pace due to agricultural plantation expansion and urban development. We shall see how remote sensing data and GIS can contribute in finding solutions to pertinent problems in land use planning. The mount Cameroon is located at latitude 4°10 and longitude 9°20. It covers an area of 250.000 hectares with a variety of land use patterns. It is the highest peak in West Africa (4100m). There are many activities leading to environmental degradation carried by the local populations. It is for this reason that the government of Cameroon with assistance from international NGOs has created a project to develop and implement a landuse plan for the sustainable management of natural resources within the mount Cameroon region. There are many land cover types and a multiple of uncontrolled uses. The Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC) is the major stakeholder within the study area and occupies 85 374 hectares of land. Part of this land is developed with industrial agriculture, dwelling units, infrastructures and the other part is covered with rainforest for future plantation expansion. This creates a conflict between economic development and natural resource conservation. A base map of the project area was developed and all the land use patterns were mapped as individual thematic layers. Administrative boundaries, forests, plantations, settlements, coastal zones (mangroves), water courses, road network, soil type and wildlife. Significant achievement in participatory land use planning within the project region is from the result of remote sensing and GIS applications as is presented in this paper. The method of data acquisition and input in the GIS database will be discussed. The paper will also elucidate how GIS and remote sensing techniques are applied in urban planning, agriculture and nature conservation. Spatial data acquisition and dissemination methods will be discussed. All stakeholders interest were generated in thematic layers (overlays) in the GIS database and presented as maps used in planning meetings at village and regional levels. The land use map shows the best options as decided by the communities concerned; It responds to the following questions: - What should be done, the selected changes to land and where they should be implemented? Mapinfor 4.1 and ArcInfo Gis software were used to generate spatial solutions to these problems. Finally land is rationally used according to the plan conceived and agreed by all stakeholders and the resources are now managed for the benefit of the present and future generations. © 2000 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

TI  - The Association Between Long-Term Exposure To Outdoor Artificial Light At Night And Poor Sleep Quality Among Chinese Veterans: A Multi-City Study
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background: A handful of previous studies have reported the association between exposure to outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) and sleep problems. However, evidence for such association is limited in low- and middleincome countries. This study aimed to examine the association between outdoor ALAN exposure and sleep quality in veterans across different regions of China. Methods: Within the network of the Chinese Veteran Clinical Research Platform, we selected 7258 participants from 277 veteran communities in 18 cities across China during December 2009 and December 2011, using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling strategy. Face-to-face interviews with the participants were conducted by trained investigators. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess participants' sleep quality. We defined poor sleep quality as a PSQI global score >7. The 3-year average exposure to outdoor ALAN prior to the baseline interview was calculated using satellite imagery data, according to participants' geolocation information. The association of ALAN exposure with sleep quality was examined using the mixed-effects logistic regression models with natural cubic splines. Results: The exposure-response curve for sleep quality associated with ALAN exposure was nonlinear, with a threshold value of 49.20 nW/cm2/sr for the 3-year average exposure to outdoor ALAN prior to the baseline interview. Higher ALAN exposure above the threshold was associated with increased risk of poor sleep quality. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratios (and 95\%CI, 95\% confidence intervals) were 1.15 (0.97, 1.36) and 1.45 (1.17, 1.78) at the 75th and 95th percentiles of ALAN against the threshold. The association of ALAN exposure with poor sleep quality was more pronounced in veterans with depression than those without. Higher OR of poor sleep quality at the 75th percentile of ALAN against the threshold was observed in veterans with depression than those without {[}2.09 (1.16, 3.76) vs. 1.09 (0.92, 1.30)]. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to outdoor ALAN was associated with higher risk of poor sleep quality in Chinese veterans. Effective outdoor ALAN management may help to reduce the burden of sleep disorders in Chinese veterans.

TI  - Quantifying The Modern Recharge Of The "Fossil" Sahara Aquifers
JO  - Geophysical Research Letters
PY  - 2013
AB  - The North-Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS), one of the world's largest groundwater systems, shows an overall piezometric decline associated with increasing withdrawals. Estimating the recharge rate in such a semiarid system is challenging but crucial for sustainable water development. In this paper, the recharge of the NWSAS is estimated using a regional water budget based on GRACE terrestrial water storage monthly records, soil moisture from the GLDAS (a land data system that assimilates hydrological information), and groundwater pumping rates. A cumulated natural recharge rate of 1.40 ± 0.90 km3 yr-1is estimated for the two main aquifers. Our results suggest a renewal rate of about 40% which partly contradicts the premise that recharge in this area should be very low or even null. Aquifer depletion inferred from our analysis is consistent with observed piezometric head decline in the two main aquifers in the region. Annual recharge variations were also estimated and vary between 0 and 4.40 km3 yr-1for the period 2003-2010. These values correspond to a recharge between 0 and 6.75 mm yr-1 on the 650,000 km2of outcropping areas of the aquifers, which is consistent with the expected weak and sporadic recharge in this semiarid environment. These variations are also in line with annual rainfall variation with a lag time of about 1 year. © 2013 American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Improving Remote Sensing Based Evapotranspiration Modelling In A Heterogeneous Urban Environment
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2020
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the hydrologic cycle. Knowledge of ET is important for modelling hydrologic fluxes and improving water resource management. Various remote sensing-based ET modelling studies have been conducted for investigating water demand in agricultural areas. However, ET modelling studies of urban areas are rare due to the challenges inherent in the heterogeneity of urban landscapes. This study proposes an improved surface energy balance algorithm for urban areas (uSEBAL) to make it suitable for estimating ET in urban environments. In the proposed approach, ET is predicted using improved energy budget components considering urban land cover composition and anthropogenic heat flux. The results of the uSEBAL are compared with the traditional method of SEBAL, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in ET estimates. The findings of this study indicate that the variability in urban land cover types impacts spatial variability in energy fluxes and ET. The results also show seasonal influence on ET for different land covers, but no significant influence of seasonality is observed on urban impervious areas, which produces the lowest ET nearly zero mm/day. The analysis of variance indicates that the differences between uSEBAL and SEBAL derived ET values for urban impervious areas are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). The results also show the variability of ET values between models for other land cover types but show small variations in areas of wetland and dense vegetation. An investigation of factors of changes in ET indicates that surface albedo, and solar radiation highly influence ET, and the errors in the estimation of them can result in the highest uncertainty in the estimation of ET. The model performance metrics indicate that the uSEBAL is better than the SEBAL for estimating ET in a heterogeneous urban environment. This study supports the inclusion of anthropogenic heat in the energy budget, and emphasizes the use of land cover maps while estimate ET in urban areas.

TI  - Sub-Watershed Prioritization Using Morphometric Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Hypsometric Analysis, Land Use/Land Cover Analysis, And Machine Learning Approaches In The Peddavagu River Basin, India
JO  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Water resource management is critical in the face of climate change to reduce water scarcity and meet the demands of an expanding population. Prioritization of watersheds has gained significance in natural resource management, particularly in the context of watershed management. This study prioritizes sub-watersheds for the Peddavagu basin using five methods. The four methods mentioned above can be estimated utilizing remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) approaches, while linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is estimated using machine learning techniques. The catchment resulted in the formation of 13 sub-watersheds. The quantitative measurements of morphometric analysis, including linear, relief, and areal, were considered, and 18 morphometric characteristics were chosen to rank and prioritize sub-watersheds. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to rank and prioritize sub-watersheds based on four highly correlated morphometric parameters. The land use/land cover (LULC) analysis used four features to prioritize sub-watersheds. The LDA analysis used two features to prioritize sub-watersheds. Using hypsometric integral (HI) values, prioritization has been done. Sub-watersheds were prioritized. Based on five methods, the sub-watersheds were classified as low, medium, and high. Among the sub-watersheds identified as high priority, immediate priority is assigned to SW10. Decision-makers in the research region can use the findings to plan and implement watershed management techniques.

TI  - Feasibility Studies Of Ppp Projects For Environmental Infrastructure In The Water Sector
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2014
AB  - Insufficient Feasibility study in the water sector is an issue in both developed and developing countries. This deficit requires a significant capital investment. One solution is to carry out projects by Public - Private Partnership (PPP). The article is devoted to analyzing and assessing the possibility of financing PPP projects (DBFO model) in terms of available resources. The Design Build Finance Operate (DBFO) model is a form of Public-Private Partnership (PPP). A PPP is a contractual relationship between a public authority and a private contractor used for construction projects requiring longterm investments. Significant for the DBFO model is that while the public authority is the owner, it is the private contractor that designs, builds, finances and operates the construction in question. The environmental potential in DBFOs would be considerably larger if public sector procurers focused more on the environmental side of the projects. The model in itself makes it easy to apply TCO-thinking. Feasibility study analyzes the financial, technical and legal feasibility of the project and part of the study is also a financial model to verify the implementation of the PPP project, which will provide for the public sector better value for money (VFM) in comparison to its realization in the traditional way. © SGEM2014.

TI  - Satellite Image Matching And Registration: A Comparative Study Using Invariant Local Features
PY  - 2016
AB  - The rapid increasing of remote sensing (RS) data in many applications ignites a spark of interest in the process of satellite image matching and registration. These data are collected through remote sensors then processed and interpreted by means of image processing algorithms. They are taken from different sensors, viewpoints, or times for many industrial and governmental applications covering agriculture, forestry, urban and regional planning, geology, water resources, and others. In this chapter, a feature-based registration of optical and radar images from same and different sensors using invariant local features is presented. The registration process starts with the feature extraction and matching stages which are considered as key issues when processing remote sensing data from single or multi-sensors. Then, the geometric transformation models are applied followed by the interpolation method in order to get a final registered version. As a pre-processing step, speckle noise removal is performed on radar images in order to reduce the number of false detections. In a similar fashion, optical images are also processed by sharpening and enhancing edges in order to get more accurate detections. Different blob, corner and scale based feature detectors are tested on both optical and radar images. The list of tested detectors includes: SIFT, SURF, FAST, MSER, Harris, GFTT, ORB, BRISK and Star. In this work, five of these detectors compute their own descriptors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, and BRIEF), while others use the steps involved in SIFT descriptor to compute the feature vectors describing the detected keypoints. A filtering process is proposed in order to control the number of extracted keypoints from high resolution satellite images for a real time processing. In this step, the keypoints or the ground control points (GCPs) are sorted according to the response strength measured based on their cornerness. A threshold value is chosen to control the extracted keypoints and finalize the extraction phase. Then, the pairwise matches between the input images are calculated by matching the corresponding feature vectors. Once the list of tie points is calculated, a full registration process is followed by applying different geometric transformations to perform the warping phase. Finally and once the transformation model estimation is done, it is followed by blending and compositing the registered version. The results included in this chapter showed a good performance for invariant local feature detectors. For example, SIFT, SURF, Harris, FAST and GFTT achieve better performance on optical images while SIFT gives also better results on radar images which suffer from speckle noise. Furthermore, through measuring the inliers ratios, repeatability, and robustness against noise, variety of comparisons have been done using different local feature detectors and descriptors in addition to evaluating the whole registration process. The tested optical and radar images are from RapidEye, Pleiades, TET-1, ASTER, IKONOS-2, and TerraSAR-X satellite sensors in different spatial resolutions, covering some areas in Australia, Egypt, and Germany.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Image And Its Despeckling Using Variational Methods: A Review Of Recent Trends
JO  - SIGNAL PROCESSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has drawn significant interest from the remote sensing community due to its ability to provide high-resolution images irrespective of weather and illumination conditions. It has numerous applications in a variety of fields, including military surveillance, geological exploration, disaster management, and mapping of natural phenomena like climate change, forest management, and volcanic eruptions. The image acquired by coherent sensors such as SAR is corrupted by granular multiplicative noise, also known as speckle. It has an adverse influence on the visual interpretation of SAR images and prevents the use of various post-processing tasks. Despeckling addresses the removal of such noise from SAR images while preserving the image details. This work provides a brief summary of the theory, applications, speckle statistics, performance measures, and recent developments in despeckling filters using variational methods for SAR images. The primary focus is given to recently proposed despeckling filters, discussing their typical usage, benefits, and drawbacks.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Segmentation Of Satellite Imagery To Estimate The Utilization Of Earth’s Surface
JO  - Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping plays a major role in land management applications such as to generate community map, proper urban planning, and disaster risk management. Proposed algorithm efficiently segments different land use/land cover classes such as buildings, trees, bare land, and water body. RMS value based multi-thresholding technique is used to segment various land use/land cover classes and consequently using the binning technique to accurately estimate the utilization of earth’s surface. The proposed algorithm is tested on two different data sets of Bengaluru city, India. The percentage utilization of surface objects for grid 7 image of dataset I is found to be 96.68% building, 1.05% vegetation, and 0.22% barren land, the area covered in grid 7 of dataset I is identified as overutilized land. Percentage utilization of surface objects for grid 8 of dataset II is found to be 68.95% building, 11.93% vegetation, 0.15% bare land, and 1.14% water body. The area covered in grid 8 of dataset II is identified as overutilized land. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Is Cost Benefit Analysis Applicable To Journal Use In Special Libraries?
JO  - Serials Librarian
PY  - 1988
AB  - This paper describes the concept of cost-benefit analysis in libraries, citing early uses. The need for cost-benefit analysis in libraries is shown, as are difficulties in applying the technique in libraries. Although many, cost minimising efforts have been libraries, “utility” measures were found to be intangible inappropriate, and so a serious threat to the integrity of the cost-benefit analysis. A systematic random sample of journals subscribed by ISRO Satellite Centre Library was subjected to a simplified cost-benefit analysis. “Cost per use” of a journal appears to be a useful ratio for assessing journals subscribed to by a library. The sample study of cost-benefit analysis of journals indicates that such a study does not answer all questions, but provides an additional dimension over and above what appears in a simple use study to an understanding of journal usage. The conclusion is drawn that many noneconomic factors dominate the decision to subscribe to a journal. It is felt that a cost-benefit analysis can increase the awareness of librarians, administrators and others concerning costs and use patterns, but cannot be truly effective without the help of intuitive value judgment. © 1988 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

TI  - Estimation Of Stand Type Parameters And Land Cover Using Landsat-7 Etm Image: A Case Study From Turkey
JO  - Sensors
PY  - 2008
AB  - Remote sensing has been considered a low-cost, large-area coverage forest information resource ideally suited to broad-scale forest inventory objectives. The objective of this study is to determine stand type parameters such as crown closure, development stage and stand types, and land cover obtained from Landsat 7 ETM image and forest cover type map (stand type map). The research also focuses on classifying and mapping the stand parameters with the spatial analysis functions of GIS. In the study, stand parameters determined by forest cover type map and remote sensing methods were compared and contrasted to evaluate the potential use of the remote sensing methods. The result showed that development stage were estimated with Landsat 7 ETM image using supervised classification with a 0.89 kappa statistic value and 92% overall accuracy assessments. Among the features, development stages were the most successfully classified stand parameters in classification process. According to the spatial accuracy assessment results, development stages also had the highest accuracy of 72.2%. As can be seen in the results, spatial accuracy is lower than classification accuracy. Stand type had the lowest accuracy of 32.8. In conclusion, it could be stated that development stages, crown closure and land cover could be determined at an acceptable level using Landsat 7 ETM image. However, Landsat 7 ETM image do not provide means to map and monitor minor vegetation communities and stand types at stand level due to low spatial resolution. High resolution satellite images could be used either alone or with field survey data. © 2008 by MDPI.

TI  - About One Of The Approaches To The Assessment Of The Technical Level Of Geostationary Communication Satellites
JO  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
PY  - 2020
AB  - The purpose of the study is to develop a methodological approach to the problem of a quantitative assessment of the technical level (technical excellence) of geostationary telecommunication satellites (GTS). The technical level indicator is a quantitative measure for assessing the perfection of the design of a product and the quality of products (services) produced with its use. This is an important technical and economic indicator of experimental design work. The value of the technical level indicator is one of the determining factors in the competitiveness of the created space system. The paper discusses the existing methodological approaches to the quantitative assessment of the technical level of science-intensive and technically complex products. We present a new approach to determine the composition of technical performance markers for calculating the GTS technical level indicator allowing a formal description of the beneficial effect and a logical scheme for quantifying the technical level. The methodological approach to calculate the degree of influence of technical efficiency indicators on the value of the beneficial effect of the use of GTS is stated as well. It is based on a mathematical model of the hierarchy analysis introduced by T Saaty, complemented by us with mathematical models for the best consideration of GTS technical features. It allowed us to ensure control of errors and contradictions in expert judgments involved in the preparation of initial data of =measurable or hardly measurable techno-economic indicators of GTS. Due to the higher level of formalization of the process of quantifying the technical level and the application of mathematical methods used in modern decision theory, the developed methodological approach serves to improve the quality of calculations significantly and to reduce the influence of the subjective factor in determining the value of the technical level indicator. Based on the above, we developed a method for quantitative assessment of the GTS technical level that meets the modern requirements.

TI  - Managing And Preventing Acts Of Violence Against Health Workers: Results Of A Review Evaluating Hospital Control Procedures
JO  - JOURNAL OF AGGRESSION CONFLICT AND PEACE RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - Purpose Violence against health-care workers represents a public health issue that affects individuals, organizations and may have legal consequences. In Italy, workplace violence (WPV) constitutes a "sentinel event", defined as a particularly serious, potentially avoidable adverse event, which may result in death or serious harm to health-care workers, and which leads to a loss of public confidence in the health-care system. In 2007, the Italian Ministry of Health issued Recommendation No. 8, "Preventing acts of violence against health workers", inviting each Italian Hospital to develop procedures and guidelines for dealing with and preventing acts of aggression. This study aimed at investigating the appropriateness of the procedures and guidelines developed by the Italian hospitals. Design/methodology/approach Procedures on preventing violence against health-care workers published by 29 Italian Hospitals between 2007 and 2020 were collected retrospectively via Web searches and further evaluated according to their compliance with the 2007 Italian ministerial recommendations. Findings A total of 9 documents out of 29 were fully compliant with the 2007 Ministerial Recommendation, 18 were partially compliant, while 2 were totally non-compliant. A total of 24 documents explicitly addressed the management of verbal and physical aggression, whereas 20 set appropriate training on de-escalation techniques for nurses and medical staff. Psychological support was fully considered in 11 procedures, partially considered in 14, while not included at all in 4. Originality/value Public procedures on preventing violence against health-care workers in Italian hospitals are scarcely compliant with the Ministerial Recommendations. The absence of specific instructions to address the needs at territorial level and the lack of support provided to health-care workers is a weak point in the effective management of WPV.

TI  - High-Resolution Soil Organic Carbon Mapping At The Field Scale In Southern Belgium (Wallonia)
JO  - GEODERMA
PY  - 2022
AB  - Accurate soil organic carbon content estimation is critical as a proxy for carbon sequestration, and as one of the indicators for soil health. Here, we collected 497 soil samples during 2015 and 2019, as well as five environmental covariates (organic carbon (OC) input from the crops, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, clay content and precipitation) at a resolution of 30 m. We then aggregated these to represent agricultural fields and compiled a soil organic carbon (SOC) content map for the agricultural soils of Wallonia using Gradient Boosting Machine. We calculated OC input from both main crops and cover crops for each individual field. As the cover crops do not occur in the agricultural census, we identified cover crops based on long time series of NDVI values obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform. The quality of the SOC predictions was assessed by validation data and we obtained an R2 of 0.77. The Empirical Mode Decomposition indicated that OC input and NDVI were the dominant factors at field scale, whereas the remaining covariates determined the distribution of SOC at the scale of the entire Walloon region. The SOC map showed an overall northwest to southeast trend i.e. an increase in SOC contents up to the Ourthe river followed by a decrease further to the South. The map shows both regional trends in SOC and effects of differences in land use and/or management (including crop rotation and frequency of cover crops) between individual fields. The field-scale map can be used as a benchmark and reference to farmers and agencies in maintaining SOC contents at an appropriate level and optimizing decisions for sustainable land use.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network For Coastal Aquaculture Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Aquaculture has important economic and environmental benefits. With the development of remote sensing and deep learning technology, coastline aquaculture extraction has achieved rapid, automated, and high-precision production. However, some problems still exist in extracting large-scale aquaculture based on high-resolution remote sensing images: (1) the generalization of large-scale models caused by the diversity of remote sensing in breeding areas; (2) the confusion of breeding target identification caused by the complex background interference of land and sea; (3) the boundary of the breeding area is difficult to extract accurately. In this paper, we built a comprehensive sample database based on the spatial distribution of aquaculture, and expanded the sample database by using confusing land objects as negative samples. A multi-scale-fusion superpixel segmentation optimization module is designed to solve the problem of inaccurate boundaries, and a coastal aquaculture network is proposed. Based on the coastline aquaculture dataset that we labelled and produced ourselves, we extracted cage culture areas and raft culture areas near the coastline of mainland China based on high-resolution remote sensing images. The overall accuracy reached 94.64\% and achieved a state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - An Object-Based Image Analysis Approach For Determining The Pattern Of Urban Growth In The First Planned City Of India
PY  - 2018
AB  - The world is undergoing the most significant wave of urban growth in history. It is expected that by 2030 the number of people living in the cities will increase to about 5 billion. The rapid urbanization has led to complex problems, including a reduction in vegetation cover, the formation of the urban heat island effect, environmental pollution, reduced open space, etc. This study intends to explore the spatial patterns of urbanization and its impact on the environment in and around Chandigarh-the first planned city of India. Chandigarh was originally planned for a population of 5 lakh, but the city has expanded rapidly over the last four decades and faces problems common to other growing cities in India, including the proliferation of slums and squatter settlements. The areas adjacent to the city boundary also face similar issues. The study presents the methods and results of an object-based classification and post-classification change detection on multi-temporal Landsat data (1978-2017). The processed data was used as an input for object-based classification using image segmentation algorithm of eCognition Developer software. The results show that maximum urbanization has taken place in the last decade in the southern and north-western directions outside the city as a result of the development of an international airport, new sectors and approach roads on the vegetated areas. As a result, maximum changes could be seen in the class vegetation as it has been rapidly changed to built-up areas. The results of this kind of study may hold immense value for planning the urban sprawl areas where up-to-date information is lacking because of the rapid pace of development.

This paper aims to develop a mechanism to track heritage monuments tagged on historical maps and then record them on modern digital maps using informatics techniques. The mechanism includes a number of detailed stages, steps and tasks. The mechanism starts with collecting descriptive and spatial data on heritage monuments from historical references and maps. Then, it proceeds on building the theoretical bases to deal with the collected data. Then, it continues with tracking and recording the locations and characteristics of heritage monuments on a modern digital GIS map connected with a comprehensive database. The mechanism ends with the data utilization stage that has been designed to make it easier to call, retrieve, analyze and explore the stored data on the monuments to serve educational, cultural, scientific and practical purposes. Medina has been used as a case study to apply the proposed mechanism due to the availability of historical maps of Medina and because heritage monuments of Medina were mostly lost due to the growth and rapid urbanization happened during the past three decades. To apply the proposed mechanism, the researcher has used the GIS Madena Map produced in 2005 as a base map then updated it with the Medina Satellite image dated 2009. The research searched a number of sources within and outside Saudi Arabia to obtaine historical maps of Medina dating back to decades (to the year 1815G). Using GIS techniques, historical maps were scanned and converted to digital maps that were overlaid as separate layers within the modern digital base map and aerial images of the city. It is hoped that the proposed mechanism is generalized and applied to other cities with similar heritage and archaeological sites. To complete the application of the mechanism, three historical monuments were chosen as examples, namely: Al-Ijabah Mosque (an existing monument), Al-Maedah Mosque (a demolished monument whose site was kept vacant), and Budhaah Well (a demolished monument replaced with a hotel). Being connected to the digital map, the mechanism allows building an interactive database designed to contain all descriptive information about the three monuments. Several multimedia techniques wereused in the mechanism allowing easy and efficient data retrieval, analysis and exhibiting. It is expected that the results of this study will facilitate identification of heritage monuments that were demolished. It will, also, highlight the historical value of cities and offer a service to many researchers and professionals in various academic and applied domains as archaeologists, planners and geographers, historians and others. Building on the conceptual and the practical application of the mechanism proposed in this study, the researcher is planning to continue a research project aiming at producing a comprehensive informational map of heritage monuments sites of Medina since the Prophet's era. This research demonstrates the importance of applying the proposed mechanism to cities and other archaeological sites in the Kingdom and the world.

TI  - Monthly Burned-Area Mapping Using Multi-Sensor Integration Of Sentinel-1 And Sentinel-2 And Machine Learning: Case Study Of 2019?S Fire Events In South Sumatra Province, Indonesia
JO  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Indonesia has experienced massive historical land and forest fire events, creating transnational environmental and socioeconomic issues. The extent of burned areas (BAs) is one of many indicators that reflect the magnitudes and impacts from fire events, and such information is also used for planning the response and recovery steps after the fire events. This information is usually derived using remote sensing (RS) data. However, the assessment on the performance using available RS data, possible RS data combinations, and existing methods is needed to regularly monitor the BA extent. This study aims to assess the performance from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar polarization (Pol.) and gray-level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features and the integration with Sentinel-2 spectral data (Spec.) for the monthly mapping of BA extent using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). The study took place in the parts of Ogan Komering Ilir Regency and Banyuasin in South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. This area has complex land-use classes, such as natural vegetation and plantations (pulpwood and oil palm), which were affected by the 2019's fire events. Our study demonstrated that the combination between Pol. from Sentinel-1 and spectral data from Sentinel-2 (Diff.Pol + Spec.) yielded the best classification accuracy with the overall accuracy (OA) values ranging from 91.80\% (XGB) to 95.80\% (RF) with the producer's accuracy (PA) from 73.33\% to 97.66\% and user's accuracy (UA) from 76.69\% to 89.80\% for the BA class. The integration of spectral data using Sentinel-2 reduced the source of misclassification of BAs from false detection from the non-fire-related land-cover conversion, such as logging activities.

JO  - Proceedings of the International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 1980
AB  - Assessment of surface area, siltation and plant product in the Aswan High Dam Reservoir utilized Landsat digital imagery processed on the multispectral data analysis system at the Remote Sensing Center in Cairo and the Michigan Terminal System at the University of Michigan. Spectral reflectance characteristics of the water were correlated with ground-truth information to analyze spatial and temporal changes of reservoir characteristics. Siltation in the reservoir was determined by comparing reflectance values in the green (0. 5-0. 6 mu m) and red (0. 6-0. 7 mu m) portions of the spectrum. Chlorophyll determinations were used to assess plant production. These determinations utilized the first near-infrared band (0. 7-0. 8 mu m). The surface area of the entire reservoir was determined by totaling all pixels classified as water. The information provided by the Landsat's digital imagery is being used to estimate changes in reservoir geomorphology and storage capacity, reservoir eutrophication, shoreline configuration, and navigation routes.

TI  - Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: A Systematic Review And Critical Appraisal Of Comparative Effectiveness And Health Economics Research
JO  - Musculoskeletal Science and Practice
PY  - 2017
AB  - In recent years, evidence has emerged regarding the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT). Despite growing evidence in this field, there is need for appropriate research designs that effectively reflect the person-centred system of care promoted in osteopathy and provide data which can inform policy decisions within the healthcare system. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesise the evidence from comparative effectiveness and economic evaluation research involving OMT. A database search was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, PEDro, AMED, SCOPUS and OSTMED.DR, from their inception to May 2015. Two separate searches were undertaken to identify original research articles encompassing the economic evaluation and comparative effectiveness of OMT. Identified comparative effectives studies were evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and appraised using the Good Reporting of Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) principles. Identified economic studies were assessed with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines. Sixteen studies reporting the findings of comparative effectiveness (n = 9) and economic evaluation (n = 7) research were included. The comparative effectiveness studies reported outcomes for varied health conditions and the majority (n = 6) demonstrated a high risk of bias. The economic evaluations included a range of analyses and considerable differences in the quality of reporting were evident. Despite some positive findings, published comparative effectiveness and health economic studies in OMT are of insufficient quality and quantity to inform policy and practice. High quality, well-designed, research that aligns with international best practice is greatly needed to build a pragmatic evidence base for OMT. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Urban Street Scale Population Estimation Based On Building Information
JO  - Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objectives: With the acceleration of urbanization and the rapid expansion of urban population, the population data on the street scale plays an important role in urban economic, social, resource and environmental development. Therefore, estimating population on urban street scales with high‑resolution remote sensing images is of great theoretical and practical value for promoting sustainable urban development. Methods: This paper uses the building information in remote sensing images and census data to analyze the correlation between street building information and population data, and the city street scale population estimation models based on building information are proposed. The best estimation model for the number and geometric characteristics of buildings and population is established based on the multivariate stepwise regression method and the Akaike information criterion that determine the significant feature variables of the building. Results: The Experiments show that the population estimation model proposed in this paper can estimate the population of street scale with high accuracy. On the one hand, the floor data can be directly applied to the estimation model. On the other hand, the floor data is also the basis for classifying street buildings. Dividing street buildings into low‑rise, middle‑rise and high‑rise buildings according to the number of floors can significantly improve the population estimation effect of the model. Conclusions: The population estimation model proposed in this paper can estimate the population of street scale with high accuracy. This paper uses street‑scale data in administrative divisions, but the estimation range of the proposed model is theoretically also valid in population estimation across street areas, which needs to be verified in subsequent studies. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

TI  - The Potential Of Non-Wood Products For Development Of Forest Tourism
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2016
AB  - Forest is one of the natural tourist resources. However, so far it has not been valorised appropriately in tourism, especially its social and cultural value potentials and non-wood forest products in general. Forest tourism is not scientifically defined nor sufficiently evaluated, despite the fact that the recreational use of forests and woodlands have long been in use. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a very important aspect of the tourist function of the forest, which provides many forms of application and is coherent with all major European directives and sustainable developmental policies. It could promote environmental sector, green jobs and positive socio-demographic effects. It might substantially reinforce innovative tourism development. The defined research problem refers to insufficient implementation of the tourist function of forests. Recent literature on tourist function of forests, particularly from the period of last ten years, has been reviewed by employing desk research method. The main findings of the study represent social and cultural benefits of forest tourism, which are oriented to promoting non-wood products. Findings of this paper are supported also by recommendations for the development of non-wood forest products and strengthening of forest socio – cultural values as well as with some examples of good practice, applicable in the international environment for the purpose of tourism development. At the end of the paper, challenges in the field and guidelines for further research are proposed. © SGEM2016. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adaptive Unsupervised-Shadow-Detection Approach For Remote-Sensing Image Based On Multichannel Features
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Shadow detection is an essential research topic in the remote-sensing domain, as the presence of shadow causes the loss of ground-object information in real areas. It is hard to define specific threshold values for the identification of shadow areas with the existing unsupervised approaches due to the complexity of remote-sensing scenes. In this study, an adaptive unsupervised-shadow-detection method based on multichannel features is proposed, which can adaptively distinguish shadow in different scenes. First, new multichannel features were designed in the hue, saturation, and intensity color space, and the shadow properties of high hue, high saturation, and low intensity were considered to solve the insufficient feature-extraction problem of shadows. Then, a dynamic local adaptive particle swarm optimization was proposed to calculate the segmentation thresholds for shadows in an adaptive manner. Finally, experiments performed on the Aerial Imagery dataset for Shadow Detection (AISD) demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison with traditional unsupervised shadow-detection and state-of-the-art deep-learning methods. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can detect the shadow areas in remote-sensing images more accurately and efficiently, with the F index being 82.70% on the testing images. Thus, the proposed approach has better application potential in scenarios without a large number of labeled samples. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Biophysical And Spectral Responses To Various Burn Treatments In The Northern Mixed-Grass Prairie
JO  - Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2013
AB  - Over the past century, environmental managers have worked to suppress fire throughout various biomes. Today, burning is generally considered beneficial to many ecosystems, though the precise effects are not entirely understood. This research aims to further our understanding of the biophysical effects of fire in C3 dominated mixed-grass prairies and to find an effective remote sensing approach for differentiating between burn treatments in late spring. Biophysical properties including vegetation cover, biomass, soil properties, canopy height, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and individual wavebands of the SPOT-5 sensor as well as two vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Burn Ratio Index) derived from SPOT-5 images were compared among unburned sites and sites with various burning treatments in Grasslands National Park, Canada. Results showed that significantly higher soil temperature and lower LAI were found in burned sites. Dead material biomass, total biomass, and percentage of standing dead cover were significantly lower in burned and grazed sites. The percentage of bare ground cover was the only biophysical variable to show significant changes in all burning treatments. Burned and unburned sites could not be distinguished based on assessing the changes of individual wavebands of the SPOT-5 sensor and the two vegetation indices. Models based on linear combinations of spectral indices were developed for biophysical properties that show significant changes in burned sites. The agreement between model simulated biophysical properties and field measured values suggest the feasibility of remote sensing to assess or monitor post-fire effects in mixed grasslands. © 2013 CASI.

TI  - Dynamic Assessment And Prediction Of Land Use Alterations Influence On Ecosystem Service Value: A Pathway To Environmental Sustainability
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
PY  - 2024
AB  - In the face of rapid urbanization, understanding and managing changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is crucial for the sustainability and resilience of urban ecosystems. Rapid urban growth resulting from changes in LULC, can lead to the fragmentation and degradation of Ecosystem Services (ES), including habitat provision, water regulation, and air purification. This study investigates LULC changes in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, from 2010 to 2021 and forecasts their future impacts on ES in 2030 and 2040. Landsat images were processed using the Google Earth Engine platform, and a cellular automata technique was integrated with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for LULC mapping and prediction. Results showed an increase in built-up areas from 31\% to 42\% between 2010 and 2021, with a projected decrease to 34\% and 32\% in 2030 and 2040, respectively. Water bodies, vegetation, and agricultural land declined from 2010 to 2021 but are expected to increase in 2030 and 2040. This trend indicates a growing awareness of the need for a sustainable environment and resilience in urban ecosystem development. The value of ES is predicted to drop from \$172.66 to \$160.23 over thirty years (2010-2040), primarily due to the degradation of water bodies (\$7.64) and agricultural land (\$6.89). However, the projected increase in water bodies, vegetation, and agricultural land by 2040 suggests a potential for recovery and enhancement of these ES values through sustainable practices. Future land use policies should promote sustainable agriculture and water resource management while fostering resilience against rapid urban growth. This approach will ensure the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. This study informs future land use strategies in Dhaka City, supporting sustainable natural resource management, urban ecosystem quality management decisions, and resilience planning. It underscores the importance of integrating sustainability and resilience into urban development policies for the benefit of both the environment and the city's inhabitants.

TI  - Quantified Evaluation And Analysis Of Ecosystem Services In Karst Areas Based On Remote Sensing
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2009
AB  - Study on the service values of ecosystem is the bridge of understanding ecosystem and helping economic decisionmaking. Karst ecosystem faces the problem of eco-comeback and rebuilding in the Southwest of China. Revealing the spatiotemporal variations of its ecosystem service is urgent requirement in the process of ecological restoration and sustainable development. Through the remote images, meteorological and statistic data of many years, the spatial distributions and variations of ecosystem service were evaluated and analyzed for the typical karst area in the Northwest of Guangxi Province in 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2005. The result shows that: (1) from 1985 to 2005, total ecosystem services decreased firstly and then increased, but the value in 2005 was less than that in 1985 in general. The estimated values of the ecosystem services in above years are 1096. 52 million Yuan, 887. 89 million Yuan, 133. 84 million Yuan, and 1062. 57 million Yuan, respectively. The trend of spatial distribution is declined from west to east, from mountain to peak-cluster depression areas. The ecosystem services in high-value areas (the western part of the region) are decreased, while those in low-value areas (the eastern part of the region) are increased; (2) The ecosystem services of nutrient cycling, organic production and gas regulation are high, the corresponding total ratios are 72.69%, 64.57%, 70.18% and 72.10%, respectively. While the ecosystem service values of water conservation, soil reservation and recreation and culture are low (below 100 million Yuan each); (3) Woodland and shrub are the dominated landscape types, and they are the first two large landscape types contributed to total ecosystem services. The total ratios of them in the four year are 71. 22%, 70. 10%, 73. 66%, 67. 03%, respectively. The ecosystem services of residence and rocky land are very low and their total ratios are only 0. 90%, 0. 63%, 0. 77%, 1. 14% respectively; (4) The change of ecosystem services per unit in every county is distinct, falling from 23549.70, 173. 5. 10, 22705. 10, 19062. 30 Yuan/hm 2 to 9764. 71, 7689. 61, 9537. 01, 7540. 79 Yuan/ hm2. The ecosystem service values have been obviously increasing in typical karst areas, but distinctly decreasing in nonkarst areas. Our study indicates that ecosystem conditions are improving because of the application of policies regarding of rocky desertification control, such as ecological migration and returning farmland to forest.

TI  - Land Degradation And Restoration In The Arid And Semiarid Zones Of China: Quantified Evidence And Implications From Satellites
JO  - LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Quantified information on land degradation and restoration is needed to support policies for sustainable ecosystem management and socioeconomic development. The arid and semiarid zones of China (ASZC) have experienced significant land degradation, and in response to such degradation, multiple ecological projects were implemented. In this study, remote sensing was used to identify degrading areas and where the degraded areas have been restored from 1990 in this ecologically sensitive region. Specifically, we integrated datasets from the ChinaCover and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products to characterize changes in vegetation, ecosystems, and environmental conditions. The results confirmed that deforestation, desertification, grassland degradation, wetland loss, and the encroachment upon farmlands were notable in the ASZC. Agricultural activity has cultivated extensive areas of natural ecosystems (46,474 km(2)). The expansion of built-up lands in terms of national policies has destroyed large areas of natural (5,487 km(2)) and agricultural (4,138 km(2)) ecosystems and continually results in negative impacts on ecological conservation. China has restored some lands (7,732 km(2) from farmlands and 24,904 km(2) from barren lands) and improved ecosystems, as characterized by increases in the normalized different vegetation index, leaf area index, net primary productivity, and gross primary productivity values in the ASZC, especially after the implementation of many ecological projects. However, it is also necessary to document the conclusions and lessons from these projects to guide future ecological policies and projects in the context of the substantial new challenges facing the protection of this ecologically sensitive environment.

TI  - Suitability Of Nasa’s Black Marble Daily Nighttime Lights For Population Studies At Varying Spatial And Temporal Scales
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - This paper investigates the potential link between changes in NASA’s Black Marble VIIRS/NPP Gap-Filled Lunar BRDF-Adjusted Nighttime Lights Daily L3 Global 500 m Linear Lat Lon Grid (VNP46A2) nighttime lights product (NTL) and human dynamics, particularly population counts and changes at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. We conducted analyses in four case studies at varying resolutions to explore the relationship of NTL data for population studies, including demographic research, disaster mitigation and adaptation planning, and infrastructure development. The analyses were conducted using different administrative geographies, including a refugee camp, a subnational region, and a country. We compared changes in population counts, density, migration, and displacement against changes in daily, weekly, monthly, and annual NTL values. Our case study results demonstrate that out-migration does not always lead to a decrease in NTL. We found that rural population decline did not correspond to a decrease in NTL. Despite significant out-migration in many rural areas NTL remained largely unchanged. NTL provided essential information on infrastructure damage in the short-term aftermath of this disaster; however, NTL alone was not correlated to the location of displaced individuals. Through news reports, we were able to corroborate the NTL changes to downtimes of the electrical systems. Monthly NTL averages were highly correlated to population counts, but a pixel-level analysis showed that the changes in NTL were primarily attributed to economic diversification. In summary, NTL is the product of several factors including demographic, environmental, economic, and political forces that shape electricity infrastructure, and we suggest that NTL data must first be parameterized with ancillary ground-level information in order to be effectively applied to population models. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Use Of Space Technology For Assisting Environmental Impact And Risk Assessment Studies
PY  - 2005
AB  - This paper investigates the potential of using satellite remote sensing as a tool for assisting environmental impact (EIA) and risk assessment (RA) studies. Environmental impact and risk assessment is now an integral part and pre-requisite part of most of the environmental studies. The large-scale spatial, spectral satellite remote sensing data provide a tool for environmental impact and risk assessment and monitoring of several environmental widespread activities. Satellite remote sensing data enables the identification, delineating and monitoring of pollution sources, distribution of affected areas including derelict land and surface land use, detection of pollution sources due to landfill and mine activities etc. The lack of environmental legal requirements and environmental management programme relating to environmental impact and risk assessment in the past years, explores the need for using cost-effective tools for applying such techniques. Satellites through their continuous coverage of the globe provide essential information that can lead to rapid and effective detection and interpretation of many hazard and impacts. Medium and high-resolution satellite remote sensing data can improve hazard detection and analysis. They can be used to observe, map, assess and monitor features and phenomena on the earth's surface. EIA and RA in conjunction with the use of satellite remote sensing data can be used to predict the environmental consequences of any development project; ensure that the potential problems are foreseen and addressed at an early stage in project planning and design; and finally enables us in carrying out Environmental Cost-Benefit Analysis of projects at an initial stage. Indeed, this paper describes several studies in which satellite remote sensing has been used to assist the implementation of EIA and RI in several geographical regions such as Cyprus and Greece. Such studies includes: public health problems due to laying of high transmission lines nearby residential areas, rapid land development and fire occurrences.

TI  - Object-Relational Datamodel Components For Geologic Mapping Conduct
PY  - 2010
AB  - Processes of terrestrial geologic mapping and preparation of geologic maps are supported by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and respective datamodels of which an assessable number are currently available. Such datamodels help mappers to define spatial geologic map units by integrating field and remote-sensing information and relate them to non-spatial information about unit details, in particular rock composition, age and age relationships, attitude data, and other characteristics. Apart from any interpretive tasks concerned with the delineation of various surface units in terms of geological and geomorphological boundaries and contents, basic mapping tasks involve an efficient management of attribute data needed for (1) applying an assignment of standardized cartographic symbols or color schemes, (2) performing spatial queries and data analyses, or for (3) combining and homogenizing mapping results generated by different groups. A unit usually carries multiple assignments to which an appropriate cartographic symbology representation is related. Such an assignment may describe the surface unit material, its stratigraphic name and relative position, or its chronostratigraphic and absolute position. The assignments of surface materials or the assignments of stratigraphic units within or without an absolute chronologic context and the subsequent selection of cartographic symbols can usually be handled using a standard geologic relationship model for which surface materials are the most important attributes. The complexity grows significantly if a data model needs to be employed which is capable of dealing with all such requirements at the same time and which is able to guide the mapper through entities and attribute values by employing object-relational concepts. We here present a geologic mapping data model design that has been implemented within Environmental Systems Research Institute's (ESRI) ArcGIS environment for systematic mapping conduct of different planetary surfaces. The model copes with each planet's specific stratigraphic system, surface chronologies, specific naming conventions, and different body references. Additionally, standards developed by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) for cartographic symbols in geologic mapping have been implemented on an abstract level and are incorporated via subtype-domain controls to achieve a high level of integrity of attribute data.

TI  - Locally Developed Models Improve The Accuracy Of Remotely Assessed Metrics As A Rapid Tool To Classify Sandy Beach Morphodynamics
JO  - PEERJ
PY  - 2022
AB  - Classification of beaches into morphodynamic states is a common approach in sandy beach studies, due to the influence of natural variables in ecological patterns and processes. The use of remote sensing for identifying beach type and monitoring changes has been commonly applied through multiple methods, which often involve expensive equipment and software processing of images. A previous study on the South African Coast developed a method to classify beaches using conditional tree inferences, based on beach morphological features estimated from public available satellite images, without the need for remote sensing processing, which allowed for a large-scale characterization. However, since the validation of this method has not been tested in other regions, its potential uses as a trans-scalar tool or dependence from local calibrations has not been evaluated. Here, we tested the validity of this method using a 200-km stretch of the Brazilian coast, encompassing a wide gradient of morphodynamic conditions. We also compared this locally derived model with the results that would be generated using the cut-off values established in the previous study. To this end, 87 beach sites were remotely assessed using an accessible software (i.e., Google Earth) and sampled for an in-situ environmental characterization and beach type classification. These sites were used to derive the predictive model of beach morphodynamics from the remotely assessed metrics, using conditional inference trees. An additional 77 beach sites, with a previously known morphodynamic type, were also remotely evaluated to test the model accuracy. Intertidal width and exposure degree were the only variables selected in the model to classify beach type, with an accuracy higher than 90\% through different metrics of model validation. The only limitation was the inability in separating beach types in the reflective end of the morphodynamic continuum. Our results corroborated the usefulness of this method, highlighting the importance of a locally developed model, which substantially increased the accuracy. Although the use of more sophisticated remote sensing approaches should be preferred to assess coastal dynamics or detailed morphodynamic features (e.g., nearshore bars), the method used here provides an accessible and accurate approach to classify beach into major states at large spatial scales. As beach type can be used as a surrogate for biodiversity, environmental sensitivity and touristic preferences, the method may aid management in the identification of priority areas for conservation.

TI  - Monitoring Intertidal Golden Tides Dominated By Ectocarpus Siliculosus Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2023
AB  - Golden seaweed tides are a global environmental and social problem, that have been occurring along Ireland's eastern coastline since the 1990s. This study focused on analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of golden seaweed (Ectocarpus siliculosus) coverage at Dollymount Strand in Dublin Bay (Ireland), between 2016 and 2022, and its relationship with meteorological conditions. Hyperspectral measurements in the field and Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to monitor macroalgal blooms with a spatiotemporal resolution of 10 m and minimum costs. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values filtered between 0.1 and 1 were used to identify the coverage of golden seaweeds. The results showed that the golden seaweed coverage extended over 99\% of the study area (54 ha) in June 2020 with an average NDVI of 0.25. A seasonal pattern of golden seaweed abundance was observed and modelled from May to October using a Generalized Additive Model. Approximately 28\% of the coverage was correlated with daily average global radiance, and 38\% of the mean NDVI was associated with daily average maximum air temperatures and wind direction by means of the Generalized Linear Models. A greater biomass of Ectocarpus spp. was accumulated on the beach when the wind direction was from the northeast and south-east. The results also suggested that freshwater nutrient inputs in winter from nearby estuaries may be contributing to golden tides on the shoreline. These findings are useful in developing strategies aimed at controlling and managing golden tides globally, as well as using them as bioindicators of ecological status in coastal environments.

TI  - Performance Of Several Decision Support Tools For Determining The Need For Systematic Screening Of Childhood Lead Poisoning Around Industrial Sites
JO  - European Journal of Public Health
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background: Living around industrial sites may expose young children to lead and cause elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). Systematic screening for childhood lead poisoning is necessarily invasive but may be appropriate, depending on children's exposure levels. Our objective was to assess the performance of several decision support tools for determining the need for systematic BLL screening in children around industrial sites. Method: We used several exposure models to predict BLLs: the pharmacokinetic model IEUBK, the InVS dose model, and an empirical relation (Lewin, 1999) between soil concentrations and BLLs. We tested the BLLs (percentage of children with a BLL >100 μg/l) that they predicted as well as threshold levels of soil pollution (200, 400, 500 ppm) for 71 situations for which the literature reports both environmental soil concentrations and BLLs in children aged 0-6 years. The tools' performance (sensitivity and specificity) was assessed by the rate of 'correct' (mass screening or not) decisions, judged retrospectively on the basis of measured BLLs, for different tolerated percentages of children with elevated BLLs. Results: Decision support systems based on soil pollution levels were not adequately protective. The IEUBK and (updated) InVS mechanistic exposure models were the most effective in this setting. Conclusion: Exposure models may provide decision support if sufficient data about environmental contamination and dietary intake are available. Absolute performance measurement nonetheless remains difficult, in view of the limitations of the input data. © The Author 2006.

TI  - A Joint Industry Research Programme To Improve Oil Spill Response Technologies And Methodologies For Use In The Arctic Offshore Environment
JO  - Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE International Conference and Exhibition on Health, Safety, Security, Environment, and Social Responsibility
PY  - 2016
AB  - For more than 50 years, the oil and gas industry has jointly funded and conducted research with industry, government, academia, and stakeholders to advance and improve arctic oil spill response technologies and methodologies and understand the potential impacts on the marine environment. This sustained and frequently collaborative effort is not commonly known and recognised by those outside the field of oil spill response. This research has included hundreds of studies, laboratory and basin experiments and field trials, specifically in the United States, Canada and Scandinavia (Potter et al 2012). Recent examples include the SINTEF Oil in Ice JIP (2006 -2009) (Sørstrøm et al 2010) and research conducted at Ohmsett - The National Oil Spill Response Research and Renewable Energy Test Facility. To continue to build on this existing research, nine international oil and gas companies (BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), Shell, Statoil, and Total) are working collaboratively in the Arctic Oil Spill Response Technology - Joint Industry Programme (JIP). The purpose of the programme, the largest pan-industry programme dedicated to this area of research, is to further enhance industry knowledge and capabilities in the area of arctic oil spill response. The world's foremost experts on oil spill response, development, and operations from across industry, academia, and independent scientific institutions are being engaged to perform the scientific research. The programme has completed phase one, which included technical assessments and state of knowledge reviews in the following six areas: dispersants, environmental effects, trajectory modelling, remote sensing, mechanical recovery, and in situ burning (ISB). Twelve research reports that identify and summarise the state-of- knowledge and regulatory status for using dispersants, in situ burn, mechanical recovery, and remote sensing in the Arctic are available on the JIP website ( www.arcticresponsetechnology.org). Phase two activities actively underway include modelling studies, laboratory and meso-scale basin testing and field experiments. Special emphasis is laid on gaining knowledge for the development of an Arctic Net Environmental Benefit Analysis (NEBA) tool to support operational decision-making for oil spill response strategy in the Arctic.

TI  - Ecosystem Services Assessment Using A Valuation Framework For The Bangladesh Sundarbans: Livelihood Contribution And Degradation Analysis
JO  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
PY  - 2017
AB  - The ecosystem services provided by the Bangladesh Sundarbans contribute in various sectors especially to the livelihood of the surrounding peoples, but they are often overlooked in the valuation process. This study investigates the significance of ecosystem services on peoples' lives and how these services are affected by climate change and other factors. Here an economic valuation framework was used to list the ecosystem services provided by this mangrove forest. Direct uses included timber, golpata (Nypa fruticans), honey, beeswax, fish, shrimp larvae and tourism. Indirect uses included carbon storage, protection from cyclones and tidal surges, breeding and nursery grounds for the aquatic species, and biodiversity conservation. This work also found that the ecosystem services were diminished by fresh water flow reduction, overharvesting, sea level rise, salinity increase, poaching, and climate change. In the present context and future scenario, sea level rise will be an important contributor to changes in ecosystem services. But because many factors impact sea level rise, the impact of climate change takes on less importance than many other causes of ecosystem service degradation in the Bangladesh Sundarbans.

TI  - Use Of Administrative Records To Assess Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Impact On Pediatric Meningitis And Pneumonia Hospitalizations In Rwanda
JO  - Vaccine
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background Ongoing surveillance is critical to assessing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) impact over time. However, robust prospective studies are difficult to implement in resource-poor settings. We evaluated retrospective use of routinely collected data to estimate PCV impact in Rwanda. Methods We collected data from admission registers at five district hospitals on children age <5 years admitted for suspected meningitis and pneumonia during 2002–2012. We obtained clinical and laboratory data on meningitis from sentinel surveillance at the national reference hospital in Kigali. We developed multivariable logistic regression models to estimate PCV effectiveness (VE) against severe pneumonia and probable bacterial meningitis and Poisson models to estimate absolute rate reductions. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine was introduced in January 2002, PCV7 in April 2009 and PCV13 in August 2011. Results At the district hospitals, the severe pneumonia and suspected meningitis hospitalization rates decreased by 70/100,000 and 11/100,000 children for 2012 compared to baseline, respectively. VE against severe pneumonia calculated from logistic regression was 54% (95% CI 42–63%). In Kigali, from 2002 to 2012, annual suspected meningitis cases decreased from 170 pre-PCV7 to 40 post-PCV13 and confirmed pneumococcal meningitis cases from 7 to 0. VE against probable bacterial meningitis was 42% (95% CI −4% to 68%). Conclusion In a resource-poor African setting, analysis of district hospital admission logbooks and routine sentinel surveillance data produced results consistent with more sophisticated impact studies conducted elsewhere. Our findings support applying this methodology in other settings and confirm the benefits of PCV in Rwanda. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Methodology And Relevant Results About An Area-Based Conservation Indicator Of Superficial Water Bodies For The Grijalva Basin
JO  - Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography
PY  - 2022
AB  - Superficial water bodies play a fundamental role in ecological and socioeconomic terms. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate methods to know which may be losing their persistence over time. In this manuscript, the methodology and main results of the spatial analysis process utilized for generating an area-based conservation indicator are presented. Binary monthly water-no-water layers were obtained from the processing of SAR Sentinel 1a images. A spatial layer of water bodies built with data from three decades served as a reference to obtain the indicators of change with respect to the area registered in this multi-year layer. Considering that the monthly indicator was calculated as a percentage of its area in the multiannual reference layer, the obtained results can be defined as long-term change indicators. It is concluded that some water bodies considered permanent in the multiannual reference layer did not cover, during the study period (2016–2018), the values of the area recorded in that layer, but that most remained close to those values. A 30% reduction in the area covered by these bodies in the reference layer was observed. Regarding temporary water bodies, these were detected with a reduction of more than 80% as compared to the value in the reference layer, which may be an indicator of their gradual loss process. The information generated can be used for management and conservation purposes at the regional and local levels of water bodies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Assessment Of Spatial Temporal Changes Of Ecological Environment Quality: A Case Study In Huaibei City, China
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2022
AB  - Under the short-term economic development goal, the excessive exploitation of natural resources and the destruction of the ecological environment make the ecological environment of Huaibei cities increasingly fragile. This study constructed the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) to evaluate the ecological environment change trend and its driving factors in Huaibei City from 2000 to 2020. The barycenter migration model was used to determine the RSEI spatial change trend, and the geographic detector was used to analyze the influencing factors of the RSEI value change. The results showed that: (1) the average RSEI value of Huaibei City generally fluctuates within the range of good and excellent grades. (2) The migration direction of the barycenter of RSEI is similar when the level of RSEI improves or decreases from 2000 to 2020, and the barycenter migration is most severe from 2005 to 2015. (3) The driving factors of RSEI change were population density (0.47) > land use (0.24) > slope (0.14) > precipitation (0.08) > temperature (0.04) > altitude (0.03). All the factors had interaction effects on the RSEI, mainly with nonlinear enhancement. (4) From 2000 to 2010, urban construction encroached on all kinds of land, which was the direct reason for the decline in ecological environment quality. From 2010 to 2020, the surge of water and meadow areas improved the ecological environment quality of Huaibei city. Therefore, reducing the expansion of artificial land, returning farmland to forests and meadows, wetland park construction, and other ecological protection measures are the keys to ensuring the sustainable development of regional social and economic development. This study can provide a reference and scientific basis for sustainable development strategy and ecological protection planning to improve the ecological environment quality of Huaibei City.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation Of Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index-Based Actual Et Against Lysimeter Data In A Tropical River Basin
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the past decades, multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing has been popularly used for estimating actual evapotranspiration (ETc) across the globe. It has been proven to be a cost-effective tool for understanding agricultural practices in a region. Today, because of the availability of different onboard sensors on an increasing number of different satellites, land surface activity can be captured at fine spatial and time scales. In the present study, three multi-date satellite imageries were used for the evaluation of remote sensing-based estimation of actual evapotranspiration in paddy in the command area of the tropical Kangsabati river basin. A surface energy balance model, the Simplified-Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), was applied for all three dates of the Rabi season (2014-2015) for the estimation of actual evapotranspiration. The crop coefficient was calculated using the exhaustive survey data collected from the command area and adjusted to local conditions. The ETc estimated using the S-SEBI-based model was compared with the Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) method multiplied by the adjusted local crop coefficient and lysimeter data in the command area. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) was applied to examine the accuracy of the S-SEBI model with respect to lysimeter data and the FAO-56 PM-based ETc. The results showed that the S-SEBI model performed well with the lysimeter (r(2) = 0.90) in comparison with FAO-56 PM, with an r(2) of 0.65. In addition to this, the S-SEBI-based ET estimates correlated well with the FAO-56 PM, with r and RMSE values of 0.06 and 1.13 mm/day (initial stage), 0.85 and 0.48 mm/day (development stage), and 0.77 and 0.52 (maturity stage) for paddy, respectively. The S-SEBI-based ETc estimate varied with different stages of crop growth and successfully captured the spatial heterogeneity within the command area. In general, this study showed that the S-SEBI method has the potential to calculate spatial evapotranspiration and provide useful information for efficient water management. The results revealed the applicability and accuracy of remote sensing-based ET for managing water resources in a command area with scarce data.

TI  - Vegetation Indices Data Clustering For Dynamic Monitoring And Classification Of Wheat Yield Crop Traits
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of yield crop traits using remote sensing techniques is the basis for the correct adoption of precision farming. Vegetation index images are mainly associated with yield and yield-related physiological traits, although quick and sound strategies for the classification of the areas with plants with homogeneous agronomic crop traits are still to be explored. A classification technique based on remote sensing spectral information analysis was performed to discriminate between wheat cultivars. The study analyzes the ability of the cluster method applied to the data of three vegetation indices (VIs) collected by high-resolution UAV at three different crop stages (seedling, tillering, and flowering), to detect the yield and yield component dynamics of seven durum wheat cultivars. Ground truth data were grouped according to the identified clusters for VI cluster validation. The yield crop variability recorded in the field at harvest showed values ranging from 2.55 to 7.90 t. The ability of the VI clusters to identify areas with similar agronomic characteristics for the parameters collected and analyzed a posteriori revealed an already important ability to detect areas with different yield potential at seedling (5.88 t ha(-1) for the first cluster, 4.22 t ha(-1) for the fourth). At tillering, an enormous difficulty in differentiating the less productive areas in particular was recorded (5.66 t ha(-1) for cluster 1 and 4.74, 4.31, and 4.66 t ha(-1) for clusters 2, 3, and 4, respectively). An excellent ability to group areas with the same yield production at flowering was recorded for the cluster 1 (6.44 t ha(-1)), followed by cluster 2 (5.6 t ha(-1)), cluster 3 (4.31 t ha(-1)), and cluster 4 (3.85 t ha(-1)). Agronomic crop traits, cultivars, and environmental variability were analyzed. The multiple uses of VIs have improved the sensitivity of k-means clustering for a new image segmentation strategy. The cluster method can be considered an effective and simple tool for the dynamic monitoring and assessment of agronomic traits in open field wheat crops.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Chlorophyll-A Concentrations In Coastal Oceans Of The Greater Bay Area In China: Algorithm Development And Long-Term Changes
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Extensive human activities and climate change in recent decades have triggered severe eutrophication problems in the coastal oceans in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China. However, a comprehensive characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns of chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha, a major indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in this region is not available. Our study attempts to fill this gap by using long-term satellite observations. With massive in situ datasets from underway sampling systems, we developed a novel hybrid Chl-alpha retrieval algorithm combining the recalibrated OC3 and line-height-based (BL443) algorithms for waters with different turbidity levels. Satellite-retrieved Chl-alpha values with the hybrid algorithm agreed well with in situ measurements, with an uncertainty level of 33.8 \%. Long-term analysis revealed significant decreasing trends over the inner Pearl River Estuary (averaged at 0.054 mu g/L yr(-1)), while significant increasing trends were found in eastern Daya Bay (averaged at 0.035 mu g/L yr(-1)). The developed algorithm is expected to aid routine Chl-alpha monitoring in the adjacent oceans of the GBA, and the long-term datasets here can serve as critical information for further coastal conservation and management efforts.

TI  - Total Mercury, Methylmercury, And Selenium Concentrations In Blue Marlin Makaira Nigricans From A Long-Term Dataset In The Western North Atlantic
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2023
AB  - Mercury in seafood is a neurotoxicant that threatens human health. Dynamic rates of mercury emission, re-emission, and atmospheric deposition warrant studies into mercury concentrations in fish because many are consumed by humans and can serve as sentinels of mercury levels in the environment. We modeled trends in total mercury content in an apex marine fish predator, Atlantic blue marlin Makaira nigricans, whose muscle tissues were opportunistically sampled from North Carolina (USA) sportfishing tournaments over a discontinuous time period: between 1975 and 77 and 1998–2021 (n = 148). The model-estimated influence of marlin weight on total mercury concentration was constant across years (shared slope) allowing for comparisons of weight-corrected mercury concentrations among years. Weight-corrected total mercury concentrations revealed an inter-decadal decline of approximately 45 % between the 1970s and late 1990s and then variable but relatively stable concentrations through 2021. The mean (SD) wet weight concentration of total mercury was 9.47 (4.11) from 1975 to 77 and 4.17 (2.61) from 2020 to 2021. Methylmercury and selenium were measured on a subset of fish to address questions related to human health and consumption. Methylmercury levels (mean = 0.72 μg/g) were much lower than total mercury (mean = 4.69 μg/g) indicating that total mercury is not a good proxy for methylmercury in Atlantic blue marlin. Selenium, examined as a Se:Hg molar ratio and as a selenium health benefit value (HBVSe), showed high protective value against mercury toxicity. Long-term trends in the concentration of mercury in blue marlin should continue to be monitored to determine whether policies to mitigate anthropogenic contributions to global mercury are achieving their intended goals and to provide information to inform safe human consumption. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Revised Iaea Data Compilation For Estimating The Soil To Plant Transfer Of Radionuclides In Tropical Environments
JO  - Journal of Environmental Radioactivity
PY  - 2021
AB  - A revision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Technical Report Series No. 472 (TRS 472) transfer parameter data for root uptake of radionuclides by crops in tropical environments was conducted under the IAEA Modelling and Data for Radiological Impact Assessments (MODARIA II) programme (2016–2019). Data on concentration ratios between plant and soil (CRplant-soil) were collated and summarised following a specific data selection process based on the Köppen-Geiger classification of tropical (class A) climates. An overview of the data collation and analysis methods is presented together with a comparison of CRplant-soil values between the revised tropical dataset and TRS 472 datasets. The revised dataset of CRplant-soil values for tropical environments is part of the IAEA MODARIA II programme Technical Document on soil to plant transfer of radionuclides in non-temperate environments. © 2021

TI  - Toward A Value-Driven Design Approach For Complex Engineered Systems Using Trade Space Exploration Tools
JO  - Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference
PY  - 2014
AB  - Design decision-making involves trade-offs between many design variables and attributes, which can be difficult to model and capture in complex engineered systems. To choose the best design, the decision-maker is often required to analyze many different combinations of these variables and attributes and process the information internally. Trade Space Exploration (TSE) tools, including interactive and multi-dimensional data visualization, can be used to aid in this process and provide designers with a means to make better decisions, particularly during the design of complex engineered systems. In this paper, we investigate the use of TSE tools to support decisionmakers using a Value-Driven Design (VDD) approach for complex engineered systems. A VDD approach necessitates a rethinking of trade space exploration. In this paper, we investigate the different uses of trade space exploration in a VDD context. We map a traditional TSE process into a valuebased trade environment to provide greater decision support to a design team during complex systems design. The research leverages existing TSE paradigms and multi-dimensional data visualization tools to identify optimal designs using a value function for a system. The feasibility of using these TSE tools to help formulate value functions is also explored. A satellite design example is used to demonstrate the differences between a VDD approach to design complex engineered systems and a multi-objective approach to capture the Pareto frontier. Ongoing and future work is also discussed. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

TI  - Contribution Of Sar Data And Image Concatenation In Reducing Optical Sensor-Derived Urban Land Cover Category Confusion
JO  - Earth Observation Quarterly
PY  - 1999
AB  - Growth and pressures of urban areas are major concerns for proper planning and resource management. Optical remote sensors have demonstrated a capability to map urban land cover but also evidence certain limitations in spectral separation of urban and non-urban land cover types used in spatial modeling of environmental parameters. The bio- and geophysical parameters of imaging radar suggest that they may contribute to the reduction of this land cover confusion. This research examined two issues: (1) the ability of satellite-based SAR data to digitally define and separate morphologic-based urban land cover types for use in non-point source water pollution potential spatial models; and (2) the benefit of digitally combining SAR and optical sensor data for such analysis.

TI  - Environmental Indicators Of Urban Green Areas For Management In Two Cities Of Costa Rica
JO  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
PY  - 2018
AB  - Environmental quality contributes to the physical and mental well-being of the population. In this way, the green areas (GA) of the cities are essential spaces for coexistence, sports, socialization, and recreation, among others. The objective of this research was to determine the environmental conditions of green areas, using indicators as tool for urban management in two cities of Costa Rica. The study area corresponded to the districts of Heredia and Carmen, Costa Rica. The existing GA were determined using Rapid Eye satellite images, 2012 through spatial analysis and remote sensing. Eleven indicators of urban green areas were applied. the species was identified, the height, the diameter at breast height (DBH) and the number of trees in parks and streets were measured. In addition, surveys were conducted to users of public GA, on issues related to accessibility and use of GA. Five types of GA were identified in Carmen and six in Heredia. The percentage of public and private green areas corresponded to 36 \% and 64 \% in Carmen and 13 \% and 87 \% in Heredia respectively. The green area per capita (m(2)/hab) was 24.6 in Carmen and 2.7 in Heredia. Sixty-two species of trees were identified in the Carmen parks and 23 in Heredia. There were 1 105 trees of 61 species in the streets, sidewalks and avenues of Carmen and 278 individuals of 47 species in Heredia. Regarding the existence of riparian vegetation, it was determined that Pirro, Burrio, Torres and Negritos streams maintain 82, 51, 81 and 14 \% of margin protection areas in conforming use. Eleven of the public GA's were evaluated, nine presented a high physical accessibility. In both districts, the surveyed citizens indicated the necessity to have more GA, highlighting the recreational, ecological and touristic value of these spaces. It is concluded that the indicators of urban green areas showed that there are differences between the environmental conditions in both of the evaluated cities. In addition, the applicability of the indicators is feasible as an input for the sustainable environmental management of urban ecosystems.

TI  - A Unified Multi-Purpose Calibration Site For Aerial And High Resolution Satellite Sensors
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2015
AB  - Experience with both analog and digital systems show that laboratory calibration is not necessarily valid in airborne conditions; whereas the advantages of field calibration are that the entire imaging system is calibrated and not alone the optical part; and the parameters determined are valid in operational airborne conditions (Cramer 2004, 2006; Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetry”, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b). The result of calibration and testing is dependent on a number of permanent system factors and systematic and random components associated with camera, imaging system, flight, atmosphere, object and data post-processing (Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetry”, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b) those affect the quality of the raw images produced by the sensors. It is therefore important to calibrate the aerial or satellite imaging sensors in specially designed fields so that the performance of the entire chain is assessed taking into consideration all the influencing factors. In addition to imaging sensors, ISO 19159 for ‘Calibration and validation of remote sensing imagery sensors and data’ also incorporates airborne laser scanners, imaging radar and water borne sonar systems (Kresse 2010). The task of developing uniform practices and standards for field calibration and testing has been taken up by several international working groups but hardly any permanent multipurpose test field like the one in Sjökulla, Finland with facilities for radiometric and spatial resolution calibration and networks of targeted benchmarks for geometric calibration at large, medium and small imaging scales is available. National Remote Sensing Centre’s (NRSC) interest is in sensor’s performance to solve the question of whether the technology will be able to fulfill present standards of map compilation for disaster management support, urban planning & development, cadastral resurvey, utility mapping, corridor mapping for canal, road, rail alignment, etc. those need very accurate data for its effective usage. With this objective a multi-sensor calibration field, first of its kind in India, designed with targets for geometric calibration, radiometric calibration, spatial resolution and height accuracy calibration is under construction in Shadnagar about 50 km away from Hyderabad that would serve aerial sensors and very high resolution satellite sensors better than 1 m. © 2014, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.

TI  - Measuring Climate Action Readiness In Maintaining Ecological Resilience Using Satellite Imagery And Field Research In Garang Watershed, Central Java, Indonesia
JO  - Biodiversitas
PY  - 2023
AB  - The long-term viability of vegetation as a representation of land cover in a watershed is critical. However, more work is needed to develop vegetation management in the form of a climate action model that considers the existence of ecological and social values as a unified system, particularly in times of climate change. Moran's Index measurements and statistical correlation analysis were employed in this study to quantify geographical patterns. These measurements provide real-world judgment in developing aggressive climate response scenarios. Ecological values were derived from shifting vegetation trend indices due to mutual interaction between living beings that build a life cycle in harmony with the environment. Meanwhile, social values are determined by assessing individual internal factors such as attitudes, knowledge, and responses and external factors represented by local government institutions. The findings reveal that the distribution of residents and residential areas is dispersed. With a high confidence level, a linear index declines with R2 = 0.5872 for inhabitants and R2 = 0.9171 for residential areas. In the dry season, there is a significant relationship between the spatial pattern of vegetation indices and the inhabitant's index. The community's knowledge and attitudes considerably impact changes in vegetation indices, particularly during the rainy season, with R2 = 0.207 for SAVI and 0.232 for NDVI. Community readiness values, which elaborate on knowledge, attitudes, responses, and the role of external institutions, show that community readiness in the upstream area of the watershed, specifically in the Kendal District, is in the best position, with a value of 6.627976. On the contrary, the Semarang District, the upstream area, has the lowest value of 4.257092. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spectral Diversity Metrics For Detecting Oil Pollution Effect On Biodiversity In The Niger Delta
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring in the Niger delta has become pertinent in view of the incessant spillages from oil production activities and the socio-economic impact of these spillages on the inhabitants who depend on the resources for their livelihood. Conventional methods of post-impact assessments are expensive, time consuming, and cause damage to the environment, as they often require the removal of affected samples/specimens for laboratory analysis. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space while using the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). The SVH proposes that the species diversity of a sampled area is linearly correlated with the variability of spectral reflectance of the area. Several authors have tested the SVH on various land cover types and spatial scales; however, the present study evaluated the validity of the SVH against the backdrop of oil pollution impact on biodiversity while using vascular plant species as surrogates. Species richness and diversity indices were computed from vegetation data collected from polluted and non-polluted transects. Spectral metrics that were derived from Sentinel 2 bands and broadband vegetation indices (BVIs) using various algorithms, including averages, spread, dimension reduction, and so on, were assessed for their ability to estimate vascular plants species richness and diversity. The results showed significant differences in vegetation characteristics of polluted and control transects (H = 76.05, p-value = < 0.05 for abundance and H = 170.03, p-value < 0.05 for richness). Spectral diversity metrics correlated negatively with species data on polluted transects and positively on control transects. The metrics computed using Sentinel 2A bands and vegetation indices proved to be sensitive to changes in vegetation characteristics following oil pollution. The most robust relationship was observed between the metrics and indices on control transects, whereas the weakest relationships were observed on polluted transects. Index-wise, the Simpson's diversity index regressed better with spectral metrics (R2 > 0.5), whereas the Chao-1 richness index regressed the least (R2 < 0.5). The strength of the relationship resulted in successfully estimating species richness and diversity values of investigated transects, thereby enhancing biodiversity monitoring over time and space. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Using Land Use Change Trajectories To Quantify The Effects Of Urbanization On Urban Heat Island
JO  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper proposed a quantitative method of land use change trajectory, which means the succession among different land use types across time, to examine the effects of urbanization on an urban heat island (UHI). To accomplish this, multi-temporal images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) of Xiamen City in China from 1987 to 2007 were selected. First, the land use change trajectories were extracted based on the classified images from different years. Then the land surface temperatures (LST) were retrieved and the magnitudes of the UHI were evaluated using the UHI intensity (UHII) indicator. Finally, the indices of the contribution to UHI intensity (CUHII) were constructed and calculated to quantify the effects of each land use change trajectory on the UHI during urbanization. The results demonstrated that the land use change trajectories and CUHII are effective and useful in quantifying the effects of urbanization on UHI. In Xiamen City, a total of 2218 land use change trajectories were identified and 530 of them were the existing urban or urbanization trajectories. The UHII presents a trend of continuous increase from 0.83 degrees C in 1987 to 2.14 degrees C in 2007. With respect to the effects of urban growth on UHI, the contribution of existing urban area to UHI decreased during urbanization. Prior to 2007, the existing urban area of trajectory NO. 44444 had the most significant effect on UHI with the greatest CUHII, while the value has decreased from 55.00\% in 1987 to 13.03\% in 2007 because of the addition of new urbanized area. In 2007, the greatest CUHII was replaced by a trajectory from farmland to built-up area (NO. 22224) with the CUHII of 21.98\%, followed by the existing urban area of trajectory NO. 44444 with the CUHII of 13.03\%. These results provide not only a new methodology to assess the environmental effects of urbanization, but also decision-supports for the planning and management of cities. (C) 2013 COSPAR.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Damage Assessment For Homeland Security
PY  - 2008
AB  - For natural or anthropogenic disasters, rapid assessment is critical for an appropriate and effective emergency response. Remote sensing has served-and will continue to serve-a vital function in disaster damage-assessment activities. This includes disaster-mapping of natural and agricultural ecosystems and human settlements, which may involve assessments of structural damage, contamination, and affected populations. Single- and multi-date (change detection) analyses can be employed, and a need to exploit both spectral and spatial information in order to delineate damage regions from remote sensor imagery is identified. This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the remote-sensing damage-assessment applications that are of utility in the realm of homeland security. Specific attention is given to remote sensing-based detection of vegetation damage and soil contamination, including a discussion of the remote-sensing implications of artificial radionuclide contamination, as well as damage to urbanized areas and other human settlements.

TI  - Archetypes Of Remnant West African Forest Patches, Their Main Characteristics And Geographical Distribution
JO  - Applied Geography
PY  - 2023
AB  - Remnant West African forest patches provide crucial ecosystem functions and services while contributing to sustaining the livelihoods of vast numbers of people. The vast majority lie outside of protected areas, although relatively few are managed as sacred forests, which limits their access and use. This lack of protection, together with a growing demand for arable land and forest resources, have accentuated their fragmentation, degradation, and deforestation. There is therefore an urgent need to generate knowledge on their social-ecological characteristics and change pressures to support their conservation. This study investigates what are i) the main biophysical and social-ecological characteristics of remnant forest patches, and ii) the potential change pressures and drivers. Within this scope, we apply archetype analysis to discern processes affecting remnant forest patches. Biophysical and socio-ecological indicators were selected from a published dataset via expert consultation, and nine archetypes were developed by applying a cluster analysis. Evaluating the results in relation to ecoregions and landscape features using high resolution imagery, we identify common underlying social-ecological change pressures and characteristics. The most common archetype (2) is characterized by being close to protected areas and having a low average annual precipitation and cluster along the northern fringe of the study area. The second most common archetype (5) is characterized by lying in highly disturbed landscapes, having undergone biomass losses, and widely distributed throughout central and western Nigeria. Patches of archetype 8 found predominantly in mangrove and swamp forests, exhibit positive above-ground biomass changes and greening trends; we propose that these vegetation changes could benefit conservation measures and carbon sequestration programs. In contrast, archetype 10 patches show both forest and biomass losses and gains and are often encompass fragmented forests in urban/arable landscapes. Identifying such common patterns of anthropogenic and ecological change provides a means of prioritizing regionalized strategies for their conservation and sustainable use. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Comparative Assessment Of The Diffusion Of Traditional Leafy Vegetables With Satellite And Innovation Platforms Methods In Benin
PY  - 2019
AB  - Innovation platforms (IPs) are perceived today as the best approaches to the development and promotion of innovations compared to previous satellite diffusion methods (SDM). Most of the previous studies have focused on the outcomes of implementing IP without addressing the underlying factors. The success or failure factors of these new approaches remain unclear. The present study seeks to compare the factors of the institutional environment that influence the results of implementation of traditional leafy vegetable (LFT) platforms to SDM results. Four case studies including two IPs and two SDMs were chosen in a reasoned way in terms of the importance or not of the market dynamics (whether or not there are any inputs market, LFT sales markets, establishment of formal or informal sales links, etc.) and the diversity of organizations (the existence of OP, importance of NGOs and support project, intervention of local structures, gender, etc.). These cases are presented following an analytical framework combining innovation systems and functionnal analysis. Data is collected through structured, semi-structured interviews, direct observations, testimonials, etc. The data collected relates to each stage of the implementation process and concerns the actors (types of actors, profile of the actors, relationships developed, roles, attitudes, practices, perceptions, etc.), the different activities carried out (entrepreneurial, learning, dissemination of innovations, investment in developed markets, mobilization of human resources, material financial resources, lobbying of interest groups), difficulties encountered and approaches to solutions. The method of analysis is essentially qualitative. The results showed that IPs as well as SDM are influenced by the previous existence of market in the implementation context. IP cannot work when traders do not show interest in the product including TLV on which study focused. We recommend for scaling up innovations that IP initiatives take this factor into account to ensure the effectiveness of its implementation.

TI  - Management Of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer In Immunocompromised Solid Organ Transplant Recipients
JO  - Current Treatment Options in Oncology
PY  - 2012
AB  - Opinion statement: The management of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs) presents a variety of clinical challenges for physicians. OTRs are at a 65-fold increased risk for developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), the most common NMSC that develops after transplantation. Risk factors contributing to the development of NMSCs in OTRs include a past medical history of any previous skin cancer, a personal history of significant sun exposure and a fair skin complexion or phototype. Further, greater immunosuppressive medication levels lead to an increased risk of NMSCs. Among immunosuppressants, specific older agents such as azathioprine and cyclosporine may increase the risk of developing NMSCs in contrast to newer agents such as sirolimus. Early skin biopsy and treatment of premalignant and malignant lesions are essential for treating these patients successfully. In this regard, the concept of field cancerization has been instructive in broadening treatments to include entire affected areas rather than individual lesions given that the areas with significant ultraviolet irradiation will continue to develop numerous individual precancerous and cancerous lesions. Field therapy with photodynamic therapy or topical 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod or diclofenac is often used in OTRs according to individual patient tolerability. Prompt excision or Mohs micrographic surgery is the standard of care of primary, uncomplicated squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. For patients with in-transit or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas, adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, and staging by sentinel lymph node dissection may be employed. For patients who develop numerous SCC per year, chemoprophylaxis can be effective in limiting the burden of disease. In consultation with the multidisciplinary transplant team, the immunosuppressive regimen can be revised to lower overall immunosuppression or altered to include newer drugs that have decreased oncogenic potential in OTRs. The greatest impact may be made by the prevention of NMSCs through simple, but rigorous, patient education on the benefits of UV protection, periodic self-skin examinations, and regular follow-ups. Accordingly, vitamin D and calcium supplementation should also be incorporated in transplant recipients. Management of OTRs requires patient education, frequent motivation for vigilance, regular follow-up, and interdisciplinary collaboration between transplant surgeons, nephrologists, hepatologists, cardiologists, transplant nurses, dermatologists, oncologists, pharmacists, and other relevant physicians ideally orchestrated by the essential transplant coordinators. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Mapping Soil Transmitted Helminths And Schistosomiasis Under Uncertainty: A Systematic Review And Critical Appraisal Of Evidence
JO  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: Spatial modelling of STH and schistosomiasis epidemiology is now commonplace. Spatial epidemiological studies help inform decisions regarding the number of people at risk as well as the geographic areas that need to be targeted with mass drug administration; however, limited attention has been given to propagated uncertainties, their interpretation, and consequences for the mapped values. Using currently published literature on the spatial epidemiology of helminth infections we identified: (1) the main uncertainty sources, their definition and quantification and (2) how uncertainty is informative for STH programme managers and scientists working in this domain. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a systematic literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. We searched Web of Knowledge and PubMed using a combination of uncertainty, geographic and disease terms. A total of 73 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Only 9% of the studies did not address any element of uncertainty, while 91% of studies quantified uncertainty in the predicted morbidity indicators and 23% of studies mapped it. In addition, 57% of the studies quantified uncertainty in the regression coefficients but only 7% incorporated it in the regression response variable (morbidity indicator). Fifty percent of the studies discussed uncertainty in the covariates but did not quantify it. Uncertainty was mostly defined as precision, and quantified using credible intervals by means of Bayesian approaches. Conclusion/Significance: None of the studies considered adequately all sources of uncertainties. We highlighted the need for uncertainty in the morbidity indicator and predictor variable to be incorporated into the modelling framework. Study design and spatial support require further attention and uncertainty associated with Earth observation data should be quantified. Finally, more attention should be given to mapping and interpreting uncertainty, since they are relevant to inform decisions regarding the number of people at risk as well as the geographic areas that need to be targeted with mass drug administration. © 2016 Araujo Navas et al.

TI  - Remote Monitoring Of Implantable Devices: Should We Continue To Ignore It?
JO  - International Journal of Cardiology
PY  - 2016
AB  - The number of patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) is increasing. In addition to improve survival, ICD can collect data related to device function and physiological parameters. Remote monitoring (RM) of these data allows early detection of technical or clinical problems and a prompt intervention (reprogramming device or therapy adjustment) before the patient require hospitalization. RM is not a substitute for emergency service and its consultation is now limited during working hours. Thus, a consent form is required to inform patients about benefits and limitations. The available studies indicate that remote monitoring is more effective than traditional calendar face to face based encounters. RM is safe, highly reliable, cost efficient, allows quick reply to failures, and reduces the number of scheduled visits and the incidence of inappropriate shocks with a positive impact on survival. It follows that RM has the credentials to be the standard of care for ICD management; however, unfortunately, there is a delay in physician acceptance and implementation. The recent observations from randomized IN-TIME study that showed a clear survival benefit with RM in heart failure patients have encouraged us to review both the negative and positive aspects of RM collected in a little more than a decade. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Earth Observations For Egyptian Coastal Lakes Monitoring And Management
JO  - Handbook of Environmental Chemistry
PY  - 2019
AB  - Earth observation tools started as early as 1970s with some limited technologies at both spectral and spatial resolution. Since then, this technology has advanced at both dimensions. Data availability and data sharing policies are also improved enabling data availability for developing countries. Such availability fostered various environmental researches among which, the coastal monitoring and management. The coastal lakes’ system in Egypt has been developed with the formation of the delta and undergone severe changes in the last decades. Remote sensing has been used as a good monitoring and mapping tool for physical, biochemical, and geomorphological features of the northern coastal lakes. For example, the accelerated area cutoff occurred due to the continuous human activities and infrastructures that could be delineated through satellite imageries. Remote sensing helped to determine the lost area of each lake with the highest rate at Lake Idku (73% in 40 years), followed by Lake Manzala (42% in 60 years), and Lake Burullus (38% in 60 years). Lake Bardawil – to some extent – is isolated from the excessive land use and land cover activities, and therefore it is partially saved from severe changes and area losses. On the other hand, the existence of several national infrastructures such as railways and highways has changed the shape of the coastal lakes. For example, Lake Mariout has changed from only one body of water mass into four dissected basins, and Lake Manzala is divided into two sectors by the new national coastal road. Remotely sensed data also enabled to estimate biophysical parameters including surface temperature, salinity, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a. For instance, it showed that Lake Bardawil has reduced levels of Chl-a (<13 mg/L) all over the year due to its isolation from drainage water and wastes (i.e., human and/or agriculture). The other coastal lakes, however have higher Chl-a levels that vary seasonally and even monthly due to the various wastes and drainage inflows. It also showed the spatial variations and Chl-a distribution along the lake on a single time with minimum values at northern part of the lakes, where the connection to the sea and higher levels downward confirms the effect of wastes and pollutants entering the lakes. With regard to spatial modeling and prediction, the IPCC model for sea level rise simulation indicated that the Egyptian coastal lakes are highly vulnerable to inundation through sea level rising with more than one predicting scenario and this would affect dramatically the whole ecosystem, particularly the aquatic environment. From a positive perspective, existence of these coastal lakes along the Mediterranean coast would play as the first-row defense for the delta zone. In this regard, applications of remotely sensed data could be used for the rehabilitation and management planning for lakes and help to exploit their natural resources and save their contribution to the national economy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

TI  - Temperature-Duration-Frequency Analysis Over Delhi And Bengaluru City In India
JO  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
PY  - 2022
AB  - The extreme temperature events are a concern in recent years due to climate variability particularly in India as there is an increase in the temperature intensity, frequency, and duration. This study represents stationary temperature-duration-frequency (TDF) analysis over two mega cities in India Delhi (north) and Bengaluru (south) using the daily maximum temperatures at meteorological stations for the period 1969-2016 observed by India Meteorological Department (IMD).The interannual variability of maximum temperature and the maximum daily recorded value indicates the increasing trend in both the cities. The study investigates the extreme analysis of the maximum temperature using two distributions, i.e., Gumbel's Extreme Value Type 1 (GEVT) and Log Pearson Type III (LPT), for return periods 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years at both the locations and the positive temporal trend is observed. The TDF curves were build using annual maximum temperature values for total 8 durations (different days) of 48 years analyzed and results show the increasing trend of maximum temperature at lower duration and high return period values. The TDF is also used for prediction of the maximum temperature for the 2 hottest years in India, i.e., 2012 and 2015, and it is comparable with the observed maximum temperature. Similarly, the predictions for 11 years, i.e. 2006 to 2016, over both the cities are simulated using both the GEVT-I and LPT-III and the models have better potential skill in predicting the extreme maximum temperature. These results can be useful for the sectors like health, energy, agriculture, urban management, and ecology management and can help the policy decision makers and disaster managers in the mitigation and adoption steps to face the extreme temperature disaster at city scale.

TI  - Effect Of Data Acquisition Accuracy On Timing Of Stand Harvests And Expected Net Present Value
JO  - SILVA FENNICA
PY  - 2006
AB  - Modem remote sensing provides cost-efficient spatial digital data that are more accurate than before. However, the influence of increased accuracy and cost-efficiency on simulations of forest management planning has not been evaluated. The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of data acquisition accuracy on standwise forest inventory by comparing the accuracy and cost of traditional compartmentwise inventory methods with 2D and 3D measurements of digital aerial photographs and airborne laser scanning. Comparison was based on the expected net present value (NPV), i.e. economic losses that consisted of the inventory costs and incorrect timings of treatments. The reference data, totalling 700 ha, were measured from Central Park in the city of Helsinki, Finland. The data were simulated to final cut with a MOTTI simulator, which is a stand-level analysis tool that call be used to assess the effects of alternative forest management practices on growth and timber yield. The results showed that when inventory costs were not considered there were no significant differences between the expected NPV losses in 3D measurements of digital aerial photographs, laser scanning and the compartmentwise method. When inventory costs were taken into account, the compartmentwise method was still the most efficient inventory method in the study area. Forest inventories, however, are usually directed to larger areas when the costs per hectare of remote-sensing methods decrease. As a result of better accuracies, 3D and compartmentwise methods always produce better results than the 2D method when NPV losses are accounted. Simulations of this type are based on the accuracies and costs of the 3D data available today, assuming that the data can be used in tree-level measurements.

TI  - Surveillance And Control Of Zoonotic Agents Prior To Disease Detection In Humans
JO  - MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
PY  - 2009
AB  - The majority of newly emerging diseases are zoonoses caused by pathogens transmitted directly or indirectly through arthropod vectors to human. Transmission chains leading to human infection frequently involve intermediate vertebrate hosts, including wildlife and domestic animals. Animal-based surveillance of domestic and wild animals for zoonotic pathogens is a global challenge. Until recently, there has been no scientific, social, or political consensus that animal-based surveillance for zoonotic pathogens merits significant infrastructural investment, other than the fledgling efforts with avian influenza. National institutions charged with strategic planning for emerging diseases or intentional releases of zoonotic agents emphasize improving diagnostic capabilities for detecting human infections, modifying the immune status of human or domestic animals through vaccines, producing better antiviral or antibacterial drugs, and enhancing human-based Surveillance as an early warning system. With the exception of human vaccination, these anthropocentric approaches target post-spillover events, and none of these avenues of research will reduce the risk of additional emergences of pathogens from wildlife. Novel schemes for preventing spillover of human pathogens from animal reservoir hosts can spring only from an understanding of the ecological context and biological interactions that result in zoonotic disease emergence. Although the benefits derived from investments to improve surveillance and knowledge of zoonotic pathogens circulating among wildlife reservoir Populations are uncertain, Our experience with human immunodeficiency virus and the pandemic influenza inform us of the outcomes that we can expect by relying on detection of post-spillover events among sentinel humans.

TI  - Space-Based Earth Observations For Disaster Risk Management
JO  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
PY  - 2020
AB  - As space-based Earth observations are delivering a growing amount and variety of data, the potential of this information to better support disaster risk management is coming into increased scrutiny. Disaster risk management actions are commonly divided into the different steps of the disaster management cycle, which include: prevention, to minimize future losses; preparedness and crisis management, often focused on saving lives; and post-crisis management aiming at re-establishing services supporting human activities. Based on a literature review and examples of studies in the area of coastal, hydro-meteorological and geohazards, this review examines how space-based Earth observations have addressed the needs for information in the area of disaster risk management so far. We show that efforts have essentially focused on hazard assessments or supporting crisis management, whereas a number of needs still remain partly fulfilled for vulnerability and exposure mapping, as well as adaptation planning. A promising way forward to maximize the impact of Earth observations includes multi-risk approaches, which mutualize the collection of time-evolving vulnerability and exposure data across different hazards. Opportunities exist as programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinels are now delivering Earth observations of an unprecedented quality, quantity and repetitiveness, as well as initiatives from the disaster risk science communities such as the development of observatories. We argue that, as a complement to this, more systematic efforts to (1) build capacity and (2) evaluate where space-based Earth observations can support disaster risk management would be useful to maximize its societal benefits.

TI  - Modis Observed Snow Cover Variations In The Aksu River Basin, Northwest China
JO  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
PY  - 2019
AB  - A major proportion of discharge in the Aksu River is contributed from snow-and glacier-melt water. It is therefore essential to understand the cryospheric dynamics in this area for water resource management. The MODIS MOD10A2 remote-sensing database from March 2000 to December 2012 was selected to analyze snow cover changes. Snow cover varied significantly on a temporal and spatial scale for the basin. The difference of the maximum and minimum Snow Cover Fraction (SCF) in winter exceeded 70\%. On average for annual cycle, the characteristic of SCF is that it reached the highest value of 53.2\% in January and lowest value of 14.7\% in July and the distributions of SCF along with elevation is an obvious difference between the range of 3,000 m below and 3,000 m above. The fluctuation of annual average snow cover is strong which shows that the spring snow cover was on the trend of increasing because of decreasing temperatures for the period of 2000-2012. However, temperature in April increased significantly which lead to more snowmelt and a decrease of snow cover. Thus, more attention is needed for flooding in this region due to strong melting of snow.

TI  - Inclusive Design Of Earth Observation Decision Support Systems For Environmental Governance: A Case Study Of Lake Nokoué
JO  - Frontiers in Climate
PY  - 2021
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data can enhance understanding of human-environmental systems for the creation of climate data services, or Decision Support Systems (DSS), to improve monitoring, prediction and mitigation of climate harm. However, EO data is not always incorporated into the workflow for decision-makers for a multitude of reasons including awareness, accessibility and collaboration models. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a collaborative model that addresses historical power imbalances between communities. This paper highlights a case study of a climate harm mitigation DSS collaboration between the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab and Green Keeper Africa (GKA), an enterprise located in Benin. GKA addresses the management of an invasive plant species that threatens ecosystem health and economic activities on Lake Nokoué. They do this through a social entrepreneurship business model that aims to advance both economic empowerment and environmental health. In demonstrating a Space Enabled-GKA collaboration model that advances GKA's business aims, this study first considers several popular service and technology design methods and offer critiques of each method in terms of their ability to address inclusivity in complex systems. These critiques lead to the selection of the Systems Architecture Framework (SAF) as the technology design method for the case study. In the remainder of the paper, the SAF is applied to the case study to demonstrate how the framework coproduces knowledge that would inform a DSS with Earth Observation data. The paper offers several practical considerations and values related to epistemology, data collection, prioritization and methodology for performing inclusive design of climate data services.

TI  - Impact Of Relative Sea-Level Rise On Low-Lying Coastal Areas Of Catalonia, Nw Mediterranean, Spain
JO  - Water (Switzerland)
PY  - 2020
AB  - Low-lying coastal areas are high-risk areas regarding sea-level rise (SLR) due to the combination of low elevation, subsidence and currently low sediment supply, on the one hand, and their high natural and socio-economic values, on the other. Because of this, there is a growing need to assess the integrated impact of SLR taking into account the interactions between physical and ecological factors to make more informed decisions for the design of adaptation strategies. This study presents a methodology for improved SLR-induced flood-damage assessments in natural areas which is composed of (i) a pseudo-dynamic method coupling equilibrium-based coastal response and classical bathtub modeling approaches and (ii) a simple method to account for habitat conversion following inundation. This methodology is applied to low-lying coastal areas of Catalonia under different SLR scenarios, which show very different sensitivities depending on the configuration of the water-land border, topography, geomorphology, and degree of human impact on the floodplain. In terms of potential impact, natural habitats will be the most benefited from the likely conversion at the expense of agriculture lands. This can help coastal managers to adopt adaptation strategies where considering the inherent capacity of some coastal landscapes to adapt opens up new alternatives. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Fusion Network To Multi Source Heterogeneous Data For Landslide Recognition
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2022
AB  - In recent years, the frequency of landslide disasters has been increasing year by year due to the extension of human activities to the natural environment. Fast and detailed landslide surveys are important for landslide disaster prediction and management. There are many driving factors for landslide formation, and most of the current deep learning-based landslide identification methods use optical remote sensing images in a short period or a few types of fused data for prediction. Therefore the upper limit of accuracy they can achieve is low. This paper proposes a landslide identification network model based on the spatio-temporal fusion of heterogeneous data from multiple sources. The model takes observations such as time-series optical remote sensing images, DEM, geological formations, and meteorological data as inputs. To address the problems of non-uniform data forms and redundancy caused by time-series data, we design the temporal phase fusion module of coupled CNN-LSTM to fuse the temporal features of multi-source data based on the extraction of their spatial features. Subsequently, we design the spatial feature fusion module based on DCNN-DBN to realize the deep expression of temporal phase and spatial features of landslides and improve the recognition efficiency and accuracy of the network. Through experimental verification, the AUC value of our proposed model is 0.8976, the F1 score is 0.8352, and the MIoU is 0.8624. The evaluation results reflect that the model can provide support for large-scale landslide disaster investigation. © Copyright:

TI  - Land Cover Changed And Economic Achievement Of Farmers In The Rawas Subwatershed Area
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Watershed management is intended to provide maximum economic benefits for local communities without neglecting environmental sustainability. The problem in this paper are how changes in land cover and how economic achievements in the form of income of conversion and non-conversion farmers in Rantau Kadam Village, Karang Dapo District. The data collected consists of primary data and secondary data. Land cover was analyzed using ArcMap Ver.10.2 with Landsat 8 for path/row 124/62 and 126/62 for image analysis. Meanwhile, the amount of income is determined using the formulas of income (NR), revenue (TR) and cost of production (TC). The land cover change was carried out by comparing the land cover map in 2009 with the land cover map in 2013 and 2018. The results showed that there had been changes in land use in Rantau Kadam Village, especially fields, open land and plantations. The use of open land has continued to increase from 1.83% (in 2009) to 8.77% (in 2013), and in 2018 it was 37.26%, while fields and plantations showed a decreasing trend. In conversion, it was found that the income of non-rubber converting farmers had a lower income value than oil palm conversion farmers. The average income of farmers per hectare per year for rubber commodity farmers is IDR 5,515,029.42/ha/year, while oil palm conversion farmers are IDR 17,109,341.38/ha/year. The policy implication that can be taken is that there must be institutional strengthening so that the selling price that applies between farmers can be the same. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Comparing The Use Of Indigenous Knowledge With Classification And Ordination Techniques For Assessing The Species Composition And Structure Of Vegetation In A Tropical Forest
JO  - Environmental Management
PY  - 2006
AB  - Dentification of groups that are similar in their floristic composition and structure (habitat types) is essential for conservation and forest managers to allocate high priority areas and to designate areas for reserves, refuges, and other protected areas. In this study, the use of indigenous knowledge for the identification of habitat types in the field was compared against an ecological characterization of habitat types, including their species composition obtained by using classification and ordination techniques for a tropical landscape mosaic in a rural Mayan area of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Plant diversity data calculated from 141 sampled sites chosen randomly on a vegetation class's thematic map obtained by multispectral satellite image classification were used for this propose. Results indicated high similarity in the categorization of vegetation types between the Mayan classification and those obtained by cluster and detrended correspondence analysis. This suggests that indigenous knowledge has a practical use and can be comparable to that obtained by using science-based methods. Finally, identification and mapping of vegetation classes (habitat types) using satellite image classification allowed us to discriminate significantly different species compositions, in such a way that they can provide a useful mechanism for interpolating diversity values over the entire landscape. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - Can Data Combination Help To Explain The Existence Of Diverse Landscapes?
JO  - Fennia
PY  - 2000
AB  - The study of the relationship between unique landscapes and environmental variables requires carefulness in the use of multi-temporal data sets. These data, such as remotely sensed images, landscape descriptions, old maps, historical records and photographs, represent the landscape at different times and from variable perspectives. This study aims to identify possible explanations to the existence and characteristics of a unique landscape. The island of Ruissalo in SW Finland represents a nationally exceptional oak woodland site. The strategy of data combination used to stress the landscape ecological problem includes three phases of deductive research planning, data management and synthesis. In general, results show that it is difficult to find any natural factor that would make Ruissalo dramatically different from the islands next to it. The overall characteristics of the climate, bedrock, topography, land uplift and quaternary deposits are common to all islands in the area. Clear differences appear when human activities are taken into consideration. Mainly because for the past ca. 500-600 years, land use trends of the island have been different from the surrounding areas. It is necessary to know how exceptional elements function as part of the landscape. Since all our management and conservation decisions are value-based, arguments we use to support our decisions should be justified and based on reliable verifications. The significance of landscape interactions is often underestimated in practical management decisions. This is especially the case when biological values of rarity and diversity are used as tools and arguments for or against landscape management and conservation actions. Combined use of spatial data was a prerequisite to get reliable information of different landscape variables. This was possible since different data were viewed and compared in the light of possible contributing environmental variables. Overall, data combination seems to be a useful approach to study landscape interactions.

TI  - A National-Scale 1-Km Resolution Pm2.5 Estimation Model Over Japan Using Maiac Aod And A Two-Stage Random Forest Model
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Satellite-based models for estimating concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5 ) have seldom been developed in islands with complex topography over the monsoon area, where the transport of PM2.5 is influenced by both the synoptic-scale winds and local-scale circulations compared with the continental regions. We validated Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) with ground observations in Japan and developed a 1-km-resolution national-scale model between 2011 and 2016 to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations. A two-stage random forest model integrating MAIAC AOD with meteorological variables and land use data was applied to develop the model. The first-stage random forest model was used to impute the missing AOD values. The second-stage random forest model was then utilised to estimate ground PM2.5 concentrations. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate the model performance. There was good consistency between MAIAC AOD and ground truth in Japan (correlation coefficient = 0.82 and 74.62% of data falling within the expected error). For model training, the model showed a training coefficient of determination (R2 ) of 0.98 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.22 µg/m3 . For the 10-fold cross-validation, the cross-validation R2 and RMSE of the model were 0.86 and 3.02 µg/m3, respectively. A subsite validation was used to validate the model at the grids overlapping with the AERONET sites, and the model performance was excellent at these sites with a validation R2 (RMSE) of 0.94 (1.78 µg/m3 ). Additionally, the model performance increased as increased AOD coverage. The top-ten important predictors for estimating ground PM2.5 concentrations were day of the year, temperature, AOD, relative humidity, 10-m-height zonal wind, 10-m-height meridional wind, boundary layer height, precipitation, surface pressure, and population density. MAIAC AOD showed high retrieval accuracy in Japan. The performance of the satellite-based model was excellent, which showed that PM2.5 estimates derived from the model were reliable and accurate. These estimates can be used to assess both the short-term and long-term effects of PM2.5 on health outcomes in epidemiological studies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - The Open Source Gps Toolkit: A Review Of The First Year
JO  - Proceedings of the 18th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of The Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2005
PY  - 2005
AB  - The open source GPS Toolkit (GPSTk) project, first presented at the ION-GNSS-2004, provides a software suite that supports general GNSS research, analysis and development. This paper will summarize improvements in the GPSTk since that first initial release. A growing community of users has adopted the GPSTk. Examples of how the GPSTk has benefited research, commercial, and military groups will be described. The goal of the GPSTk project is to free the research community from the burden of implementing standard satellite navigation algorithms. The project provides a software suite that consists of a set of applications built upon a central library. The GPSTk distribution is available for download at http://www.gpstk.org/.The software is organized into a core library, and a set of applications built upon the library. The GPSTk library provides functions that are common to many applications. The functions include: time conversion; matrix and statistical analyses; reading and writing of standard formats, such as RINEX and SP3; position determination using gradient and algebraic techniques; troposphere delay models; ionosphere delay models; and P-code generation. The library functionality can be accessed by users through custom-built software applications or through the applications distributed with the GPSTk. The GPSTk library and most of its applications are written in highly object oriented ANSI standard C++. Functionality in the library is accessed through functions associated with classes. Classes are an object oriented construct that binds data and functions into one module. One advantage of this approach is that the user can interchange equivalent classes. For example, the user can trivially switch from the use of broadcast to precise ephemerides. By providing these standard models in a production quality and modular form, the library empowers the user to concentrate on new applications rather than on base-level capabilities. The GPSTk software suite is available to the public under the Lesser GNU Public License, or LGPL. The LGPL grants the user a number of rights; notably, the ability to choose whether to modify and redistribute the source code. A number of new applications and library capabilities have been added the GPSTk since the ION-GNSS-2004. Many of these modifications have been introduced in order to broaden the audience that can benefit from the GPSTk. The software suite now builds under more operating systems, including AIX 5.2 and OS X. GPSTk users have contributed patches to enable support for more compilers. In order to support users of standard GNU software development tools, a makefile generation process has been added, supplementing the original build process based on the Jam utility. In addition to making the GPSTk compatible with more compilers and operating system, the functionality of the GPSTk has also been enhanced. The latest stable version of the GPSTk, version 1.1, addresses a number of feature requests and bug reports. New RINEX applications have been added, along with new ephemeris routines to support receivers like the Novatel Superstar, In addition, a RINEX conversion utility for Novatel receivers has been added. A test system has been added to the GPSTk. The purpose of the test system is to provide a consistent, reproducible architecture for ensuring the correctness of library functionality. The test system will run on any system that supports the programming language Perl.By design, the GPSTk software is portable across platforms. However, applications in languages such as Perl, Python, or MATLAB cannot directly call GPSTk library functions. To address this, an interface package has been added to the GPSTk that can generate interfaces,or bindings from the GPSTk core library to a number of other languages. The bindings are created using another open source project called the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG). SWIG supports the creation of bindings from C++ to over a dozen languages. In version 1.2 of the GPSTk, SWIG has been used to create bindings to the Python lan uage. Over the last year, a number of research groups, private companies, and individuals have adopted the GPSTk. The groups span all sectors of GNSS users, from the private sector to the research and military sectors. At Worcester Polytechnic Institute, a student group has adapted the GPSTk to provide onboard programming for their space bound formation flight experiment, the Power metallurgy And Navigation SATellite (PANSAT). In the private sector, Fusion Numerics uses the GPSTk to power its numerical ionospheric forecasting system. Finally, in the military sector, the U.S. Air Force 17th Test Squadron has adopted the GPSTk as the standard toolset for the evaluation of GPS's performance.

TI  - Probabilistic Seasonal Dengue Forecasting In Vietnam: A Modelling Study Using Superensembles
JO  - PLOS MEDICINE
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002-2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score {[}CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI 60.6-148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5-80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI 102-575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI 120-168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems. Author summary Why was this study done? A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to the most at-risk places. Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in advance. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and locations. We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6 months ahead. The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks than the baseline model across all lead times. The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission. What do these findings mean? While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict, particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool. Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources.

TI  - Mapping Night-Time Light Emissions In The Eu Using Satellite Observed Visible-Near-Infrared Emissions As A Policy Tool: The Mantle Project
PY  - 2003
AB  - Night-time light emissions maps derived from coarse resolution satellite imagery provide a means to obtain continent-wide or even global estimates of the area covered by human settlements. Such night-time light emissions maps can also be regarded as a surrogate measure for a range of other socioeconomic and environmental indicators, notably population number \& density, GDP, energy consumption \& wastage, skyglow and tranquil areas. The MANTLE project builds upon a project definition phase incorporating a state of the art review and user-requirements survey carried out across the EU to define, produce and present a range of information products derived from night-time satellite imagery that are of value to national and international users. MANTLE uses reduced gain data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) to derive country and EU-wide night-time light emissions mosaics. Regression-based modelling techniques have demonstrated that strong relationships exist between these DMSP OLS data and such parameters as population, GDP, road lighting, energy wastage and total energy consumption. This paper describes some of the analyses carried out during the MANTLE project and presents preliminary versions of some potential MANTLE products.

TI  - Evaluating Landscape Options For Corridor Restoration Between Giant Panda Reserves
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2014
AB  - The establishment of corridors can offset the negative effects of habitat fragmentation by connecting isolated habitat patches. However, the practical value of corridor planning is minimal if corridor identification is not based on reliable quantitative information about species-environment relationships. An example of this need for quantitative information is planning for giant panda conservation. Although the species has been the focus of intense conservation efforts for decades, most corridor projects remain hypothetical due to the lack of reliable quantitative researches at an appropriate spatial scale. In this paper, we evaluated a framework for giant panda forest corridor planning. We linked our field survey data with satellite imagery, and conducted species occupancy modelling to examine the habitat use of giant panda within the potential corridor area. We then conducted least-cost and circuit models to identify potential paths of dispersal across the landscape, and compared the predicted cost under current conditions and alternative conservation management options considered during corridor planning. We found that due to giant panda's association with areas of low elevation and flat terrain, human infrastructures in the same area have resulted in corridor fragmentation. We then identified areas with high potential to function as movement corridors, and our analysis of alternative conservation scenarios showed that both forest/bamboo restoration and automobile tunnel construction would significantly improve the effectiveness of corridor, while residence relocation would not significantly improve corridor effectiveness in comparison with the current condition. The framework has general value in any conservation activities that anticipate improving habitat connectivity in human modified landscapes. Specifically, our study suggested that, in this landscape, automobile tunnels are the best means to remove current barriers to giant panda movements caused by anthropogenic interferences.

JO  - 15th Annual International Symposium of the International Council on Systems Engineering, INCOSE 2005
PY  - 2005
AB  - An enterprise architecture for the Earth Science activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was developed to assist in assessing the capacity of scientific instruments in meeting the needs of society. It can also help them develop the right investment strategies and help scientists and engineers in their planning for system development, especially for complex space-based environmental sensors. The architecture contains about 3000 elements that are involved in earth science research: observation sources, sensors, environmental parameters, data products, mission products, observations, science models, predictions, and decision-support tools. The science models use observations from the space-based instruments to generate predictions about various aspects of the environment. These predictions are used by decision-makers around the world to help minimize property damage and loss of human life due to adverse conditions such as severe weather storms. The architecture is developed using both traditional and non-traditional SE tools and techniques. This paper will describe additional methods needed for the SE toolbox. © 2005 by James N Martin.

TI  - Mutual-Information-Based Registration Of Terrasar-X And Ikonos Imagery In Urban Areas
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2010
AB  - The launch of high-resolution remote sensing satellites like TerraSAR-X, WorldView, and Ikonos has benefited the combined application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imageries tremendously. Specifically, in case of natural calamities or disasters, decision makers can now easily use an old archived optical with a newly acquired (postdisaster) SAR image. Although the latest satellites provide the end user already georeferenced and orthorectified data products, still, registration differences exist between different data sets. These differences need to be taken care of through quick automated registration techniques before using the images in different applications. Specifically, mutual information (MI) has been utilized for the intricate SAR-optical registration problem. The computation of this metric involves estimating the joint histogram directly from image intensity values, which might have been generated from different sensor geometries and/or modalities (e.g., SAR and optical). Satellites carrying high-resolution remote sensing sensors like TerraSAR-X and Ikonos generate enormous data volume along with fine Earth observation details that might lead to failure of MI to detect correct registration parameters. In this paper, a solely histogram-based method to achieve automatic registration within TerraSAR-X and Ikonos images acquired specifically over urban areas is analyzed. Taking future sensors into a perspective, techniques like compression and segmentation for handling the enormous data volume and incompatible radiometry generated due to different SAR-optical image acquisition characteristics have been rightfully analyzed. The findings indicate that the proposed method is successful in estimating large global shifts followed by a fine refinement of registration parameters for high-resolution images acquired over dense urban areas. © 2009 IEEE.

TI  - Study On Habitat Suitability Change And Habitat Network Of Rare Wintering Cranes In Important International Wetlands
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Chongming Dongtan wetland is a typical estuarine wetland, located in Chongming District, Shanghai, China, with high ecological significance. The protection of wintering crane's habitat has attracted the wide attention of the international community. Because of the importance of the region in the protection of international biodiversity and the protection of crane habitats, it is of great reference value to study the habitat suitability changes of rare wintering cranes with spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the distribution of habitat corridors with spatial characteristics, to improve the habitat quality of crane habitats in globally important wetlands. Based on the remote sensing image data of Chongming Dongtan and the field survey data of rare wintering cranes, this study obtained the land use change of Chongming Dongtan from 1986 to 2021 by ENVI and ArcGIS10.8 software, evaluated the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in 36 years by GIS technology, and constructed the habitat corridor of wintering cranes by using the minimum cumulative resistance model(MCR). The results showed that from 1986 to 2021, the number of four typical wintering cranes in Chongming Dongtan showed a general downward trend. In the past 36 years, the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in the internationally important wetland of Chongming Dongtan has gradually changed from a suitable area to an unsuitable area. The suitable areas are mainly distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the study area, and the unsuitable areas are mainly distributed in the western construction land area. The habitat quality of cranes is deteriorating. The overall resistance distribution of Chongming Dongtan in 2021 shows a trend of low resistance value in the east and high resistance value in the west, and the degree of obstruction is strong in the south and weak in the north. There are 208 potential habitat corridors for wintering cranes in Chongming Dongtan, with a total length of 377.12 km. Get 127 Habitat nodes. The density of habitat corridors in the eastern part of the study area is significantly higher than that in the western region, and the ecological space in the eastern region is well connected. Finally, this study proposes the identification of important habitat corridors based on gravity model and the analysis of habitat network structure based on graph theory, which provides a reference for improving the stability of habitat network by means of habitat node optimization, stepping stone increase and ecological restoration. This study is different from previous studies on large-scale ecological conditions such as cities or urban coastal zones. From the perspective of the construction of regional wetland rare species habitat network and the protection of international important wetland biodiversity with important ecological value, it is helpful to optimize the suitable habitat pattern of rare overwintering cranes and provide a method basis for the protection of rare species habitat and the construction of habitat network in regional wetlands. At the same time, Chongming Dongtan is the only internationally important wetland in Shanghai. Wintering cranes are the most important biological resources of wetlands. The study of habitat suitability changes and habitat networks can effectively promote the development of internationally important wetland cities in Shanghai.

TI  - Evaluation And Pattern Optimization Of Ecological Space Of Chongqing With Remote Sensing Data
JO  - Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evaluation of ecological space is the basic decision-making for ecological protection and regionalization which closely connected with the variations of ecological functioning. To evaluate the ecological space, we constructed an ecological spatial evaluation system suitable for fragile and sensitive environment by the help of GIS (Geo-Information system) and RS (Remote Sensing). Here we introduced four components for ecological space functioning: ecological sensitivity, ecosystem service value, landscape pattern and ecosystem quality. The ecological sensitivity was comprehensively calculated by soil erosion, rocky desertification, habitat type and acid rain. We measured the ecological service value by integrated method of the value equivalent factor in unit area. Then, we evaluated index of ecological space by judgment matrix method from the above four components. Through overlay of Ecological red line and Nature reserve system, we divided ecological space into high ecological index space, low ecological index space with high sensitivity or service value, low ecological index space and analyzed spatial pattern characteristics of each type. The study provided important references for optimization of land distribution. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Challenging Place With Narrative: The Progress Towards A Performance
JO  - Design Principles and Practices
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper concerns the collaborative studio held in 2009 involving students of the Faculty of the Built Environment, University of New South Wales, (FBE, UNSW) working with those of the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). The students worked with the director to develop a performance titled "Lots In Space" based upon a variety of texts including those of Jacobean dramas. The performance involved activating the axial mall of UNSW through performance, lighting, projected film and animation. The audience walked the mall and the structure of the narrative was set by the architecture and landscape of the space. The architecture and texts were not combined in a chronological nor rational structure. The director adopted a free-association of imagery originating from texts but structured loosely in the manner of a Jacobean drama. Decisions regarding the choice of which imagery and which action in a particular location were made as much by reference to the architecture as to the narrative of the text; an approach the students found confusing. Michel de Certeau's "Walking in the City" was central to understanding the director's approach to the performance. For de Certeau the city is consumed by its occupants and the tactics of use add as much vitality as the strategic objectives of the planners. The author makes use of the idea of pedestrian pathways as personal narratives of the city. Narrative pathways suggest an alternative design method through a tactical approach rooted in the negotiation of the minutiae of organisation and the favouring of the particular to the general. Such an approach offers benefits to group design projects whereby the rigour of a central designer is instead replaced by a free-flowing narrative pathway giving acceptability to the idea that a loose structure can bend to allow response at the detail level without the notion of the whole strategy being compromised. © 2010 Common Ground, Lena Darweesh, All Rights Reserved, Permissions.

TI  - Development Of A Global Urban Greenness Indicator Dataset For 1,000
JO  - DATA IN BRIEF
PY  - 2023
AB  - Global climate change has sparked effort s to adapt to in-creasing temperatures, especially in urban areas that experi-ence increased day and nighttime temperatures due to the urban heat island effect. The addition of greenspace has been suggested as a possible means for urban centers to re-spond to increasing urban temperatures. Thus, it is impor-tant for urban planning and policymakers to have access to data on greenspace specific at a fine spatial resolution. This dataset consists of information on peak and annual average 1 x 1 km Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for over 1,000 global urban centers, which is an objective satellite-based measure of vegetation. Population-weighted values for both peak and annual average NDVI and include an indicator of greenness, with seven levels ranging from ex-tremely low to extremely high are provided. Additional infor-mation regarding the climate zone (using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification) and level of development (using the Human Development Index or HDI) for each city is included. Analyses were repeated in 2010, 2015, and 2020 to provide the ability to track urban greenness over time. Data are pro-vided in tabular format with summaries presented in both tables and graphics. These data can be used to inform policy and planning and can be used as an indicator for a variety of climate and health investigations. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Analyzing The Effects Of Blue- Green-Grey Infrastructure Patterns On Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study Of Hue City
JO  - 42nd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2021
PY  - 2021
AB  - City is considered as a main source of greenhouse gas emission which might cause environmental modification, such as urban heat island (UHT) phenomenon, ecosystem fragmentation and degradation. The role of Blue-Green-Grey infrastructure (BGGI) in mitigating the UHI effects has become a hybrid approach for sustainable urban under climate change. In this paper, the combination of remote sensing, GIS, and spatial landscape metrics was conducted to analyze the relationship between BGGI and land surface temperature (LST) of Hue City. The LST was extracted from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image, while BGGI was grouped from land use/land cover was classified from Sentinel-2A image. The spatial landscape metrics, including the percentage of landscape (PLAND), edge density (ED) were calculated for BGGI by using 10 x10 pixel grid. The multiple regression analysis between landscape metrics and LST show a high adjusted R2 value at 0.816 (p<0.05). In which, the PLAND of Blue and Green infrastructure contribute to decreasing LST (β = -0.725 and 0.780, respectively). Conversely, the ED of Grey infrastricture has a negative contribution on increasing the LST (β = 0.080). In addition, the ANOVA test result demonstrates the Blue and Green infrastructure help the LST ease by approximately 20C and 3.50C compared to Grey infrastructure (p <0.05). The findings from this study will contribute to providing a significant basis information for urban planning in orienting green space. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.

TI  - Runoff Estimation With Low Altitude Remote Sensing And Satellite Images
JO  - Arid Land Geography
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate monitoring of runoff from small and medium-sized rivers is of great significance for ecological stability in arid areas. However, it is difficult to accurately retrieve the flow of small and medium-sized rivers by remote sensing. Taking the Zhongfengchang river section of Kashi River in Nilka County, Xinjiang, China, as an example, this study constructed a power function relationship model between river width, water depth, and discharge based on the relationship fitting method and measured hydrological data, unmanned aerial vehicle data, and satellite data. Using the time series of satellite data, the runoff volume of the monitored river section was inferred 24 times in different periods. The results show that when the runoff rate is 0-50 m3·s−1 and 50-100 m3·s−1, the inversion of the runoff rate based on the hydraulic geometry of the river width is optimal, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.15 m3·s−1and 2.81 m3·s−1, respectively; when the runoff rate is 100-200 m3·s−1 and > 200 m3·s−1, the inversion of the hydraulic geometry based on water depth and river width is the best, with RMSEs of 13.37 m3·s−1 and 1.06 m3·s−1, respectively. These findings provide a new method for the fine monitoring and management of runoff of small and medium-sized rivers in areas lacking hydrologic data and have high reference value for flood disaster prediction, hydropower resource development, and water ecosystem restoration. © 2023 Journal of Ceramics.

TI  - Historical Reconstruction Of Sediment Accumulation Rates As An Indicator Of Global Change Impacts In A Tropical Crater Lake
JO  - Journal of Paleolimnology
PY  - 2022
AB  - Lakes are effective sentinels of global change owing to their sensitivity to land-use changes and climate variability in their catchment. Santa María del Oro Lake (SAMO, NW Mexico) is of interest both for global change studies and as a natural resource to sustain the economy of local communities. Four sediment cores were used to evaluate the temporal variations of sediment accumulation, under the hypothesis that changes in sediment input are mostly driven by anthropic activities developed in the lake surroundings. Radiocarbon (14C) dating of SAMO sediments was precluded by a large and variable reservoir effect, inducing an age offset of ~ 4000 years. Well-constrained chronologies over the past century were obtained by 210Pb dating, corroborated by the stratigraphic markers 137Cs, 239+240Pu, and 14C-fraction modern. Geochemical, magnetic susceptibility, and meteorological data were used to elucidate the main controls of sedimentation processes in the lake. Mass accumulation rates were high, likely because of the natural vulnerability of catchment soils to hydric and aeolian erosion. The highest values, observed towards the lakeshore, were attributed to the influence of seasonal runoff from the surrounding steep hills, and the proximity of human settlements and agricultural fields. Mean mass accumulation rates increased with time (from 0.03 ± 0.01 g cm−2 year−1 between 1900 and 1950, to 0.14 ± 0.10 g cm−2 year−1 after the 1950s), although the most recent values were comparable to the mean values during the pre-1950 period. Accumulation maxima across the lake, occurring mostly since the 1980s, concurred with precipitation minima and were related to terrigenous pulses associated with soil erosion, likely favored by lower soil humidity and the occurrence of wildfires during dryer years. Controls on the development of human settlement and agriculture practices should be included in the long-term environmental management plans for the conservation of the lake resources. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an important tick-borne disease which can cause a broad range of symptoms mainly affecting the skin, the nervous system and the joints. This study aims to estimate the incidence of the different clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium. The incidence of erythema migrans (EM) was estimated through the network of sentinel general practices at 97.6/100,000 inhabitants (uncertainty interval {[}UI] 82.0-113.0) for the period 2015-2017. This result was used to estimate the incidence of other LB manifestations based on their proportional distribution (ratios) to EM reported in the neighboring countries of Belgium. To estimate these ratios, we performed a systematic review of studies published between February 1, 2008 and January 31, 2018 and pooled the results using a random effects meta-analysis. Six studies were retained in the systematic review, and the meta-analysis estimated the occurrence ratios for Lyme neuroborreliosis/EM, Lyme arthritis/EM and other manifestations/EM at 0.024 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.016-0.037), 0.022 (95\% CI 0.020-0.024) and 0.014 (95\% CI 0.012-0.016) respectively. Applying these ratios to the EM incidence in Belgium resulted in an incidence estimation of 2.4/100,000 inhabitants (95\% UI 1.5-3.7) for Lyme neuroborreliosis, 2.1/100,000 (95\% UI 1.7-2.6) for Lyme arthritis and 1.4/100,000 (95\% UI 1.1-1.7) for other less frequent manifestations. Some of these LB manifestations, other than EM, are more severe, hence these estimates are essential to assess the health burden and economic cost of LB which would be highly relevant for patients, healthcare providers and policymakers. As both over-and underestimation of different clinical LB manifestations remain possible due to characteristics of the primary surveillance systems and the disease itself, future studies to validate these estimates would be of great value.

TI  - Estimation Of Terrestrial Water Storage Change In The Bhagirathi Ganga And Vishnu Ganga Basins Using Satellite Gravimetry
PY  - 2013
AB  - Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) in the Bhagirathi Ganga and Vishnu Ganga basins is an important hydrologic component for the Ganga River. Improved estimation of TWS in the Bhagirathi Ganga and Vishnu Ganga basins is crucial for water resources management for India. Despite its importance, storage and change of TWS in the study area has not been well studied at a larger scale. In this investigation, TWS and its change (TWSC) is estimated in the Bhagirathi Ganga and Vishnu Ganga basins during the period of 2004 to 2010. TWS is calculated from two methods: The first method employs the GRACE remote sensing satellite while the second employs estimation by use of climate data of study area provided by NOAA. TWSC is estimated from the TWS by subtraction of two consecutive monthly values. In addition, Total water storage change is also estimated from a water balance approach using a combination of precipitation, runoff and transevaporation. The spatial average values of GRACE and NOAA from 1(0)x1(0) spatial resolutions was extracted using a watershed mask derived from the DEM of the Bhagirathi Ganga and Vishnu Ganga basins. The TWS result from the GRACE and NOAA show decreasing trend in TWS of 0.54 cm/year and 0.2 cm/year, respectively due to decrease in precipitation, high evaporation of the study area. The results indicate the great potential of GRACE and water balance approach using NOAA data for providing hydrological information to water resource management in Uttarakhand.Grace, DEM, Terrestrial water storage change, NOAA

TI  - Estimation Of Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery In Boreal Forests Using Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (Sif) Data
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
PY  - 2021
AB  - The estimation of post-fire vegetation recovery is essential for forest management and wildfire policy-making. In the last few decades, vegetation indices have been widely used to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery by comparison with the pre-fire state. In this study, vegetation recovery is estimated using Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), which is a by-product of photosynthesis and can reflect the physiological characteristics of a plant. We found that 20 years is insufficient for vegetation recovery, as the SIF within burned areas exhibited a significant increasing trend, which was most notable within the first 6 to 10 years after a wildfire. When comparing the SIF within and outside burned areas, we found that, during the first 3 to 6 years, SIF values outside burned areas were larger than that within burned areas; however, after similar to 6 years, the SIF within the burned areas exceeded that outside burned areas owing to the different carbon sequestration intensities of different vegetation recovery stages. Field photos of recovering vegetation were then compared with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) trend within the burned area, and it was found that, although the EVI reached pre-fire levels or stabilised, vegetation recovery was continuing.

TI  - Re-Introducing The Benefits Of Terrain Mapping For Pipeline Routing And Design
JO  - Proceedings of the Biennial International Pipeline Conference, IPC
PY  - 2016
AB  - Terrain mapping is the process of the interpretation of aerial photographs, LiDAR and satellite imagery plus field based ground truthing to delineate and characterize terrain polygons with similar surficial materials, landforms and geological processes [1]. For new pipeline projects, detailed terrain mapping is usually completed at a map scale of 1:20,000 corresponding to ground accuracy, at best, of 20 m. Although typically used to support the forestry industry in planning and developing forestry operations in British Columbia, Canada [2], and despite the rapid advancements of remote sensing technology, the art and science of terrain mapping continues to be an essential. albeit somewhat forgotten, tool for new and existing pipeline projects in a variety of terrain settings. For new pipeline projects, a quality terrain mapping product has been be used to characterize ground conditions and support the estimation of design inputs for numerous aspects of pipeline routing and design [3,4]. It is the backbone of most terrain and geohazard related tasks on a pipeline project and it is useful through many stages of a project's development [5]. At routing and feasibility stages of a project, terrain mapping can be used to efficiently identify geohazards to avoid and to allow comparison of the terrain between different corridor options. Later on at the early design stages, terrain mapping can be used to develop and maintain a geohazard inventory to support geohazard risk assessment and design through geohazards that could not be avoided [6], delineate areas of shallow groundwater where buoyancy control and construction dewatering maybe required, help estimate soil spring parameters to support pipe stress analysis, delineate areas of shallow bedrock to support construction cost estimates and planning [8], and to identify sources of sands and gravels that maybe used for pipeline construction. This paper is intended to re-introduce the ongoing benefits of terrain mapping for new pipeline projects and describe how terrain mapping can cost-effectively support a pipeline project through its lifecycle of feasibility, design, and construction. Examples of the benefits of terrain mapping for routing and design of two proposed transmission pipelines in northern BC are presented. This work will be of interest to project managers, engineers, scientists and regulators involved with routing, design, and construction of new pipelines projects. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Use Of Satellite Image Derived Products For Early Warning And Monitoring Of The Impact Of Drought On Food Security In Africa
JO  - Time-Sensitive Remote Sensing
PY  - 2015
AB  - African and other countries in theworld suffer from regular occurrence of extreme weather events of which droughts form a significant part. This is seriously affecting the ability of those countries to cover their population needs in food supply and to maintain their livelihood. However, the pattern of droughts is extremely variable both temporally and spatially and it is crucial that decision makers be informed in advance of the extent and location of potential drought conditions to target relief measures. Approaches to food security monitoring based on the temporal and spatial analyses of Satellite image derived products are presented. These approaches demonstrate that the extent and severity of a drought can effectively be characterised in near real time. Examples of previouswork in Zambia showed the benefit of integrating historical agricultural statistics with satellite derived products to better attribute vegetation development variability to agricultural production thus providing a means to predict potential crop production levels for the current growing season. Other work in Namibia, Niger, Senegal, South Sudan and Botswana shows that such techniques can be used to monitor rangeland primary production levels for a given season. Lessons from the implementation of these approaches operationally are summarized, emphasizing the importance of institutional support. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

TI  - Urban Agglomeration Worsens Spatial Disparities In Climate Adaptation
JO  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Many countries promote urban agglomeration to enhance economic competitiveness, but the impacts of this strategy on local climate adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we use variation in greenspaces to test the effectiveness of climate adaptation policy across climate impacts and vulnerability dimensions. Using satellite imagery and logistic regression, we analyze spatiotemporal correlation between greenspace and climate vulnerability in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, an area comprising similar to 70 million people and 11 cities, making it a useful natural experiment for our study. We find that while greenspace increases proportionally with climate exposure and sensitivity, many cities exhibit discrepancies between greenspace variation and climate vulnerability. Green adaptation funnels into wealthier, less vulnerable areas while bypassing more vulnerable ones, increasing their climate vulnerability and undermining the benefits of urban agglomeration. The results suggest that centrally-planned climate adaptation policy must accommodate local heterogeneity to improve urban sustainability. By neglecting local heterogeneity, urban agglomeration policy risks exacerbating spatial inequalities in climate adaptation.

TI  - Cost Modelling Study On The Feasibility Of On-Orbit Refuelling Of Indian Geo-Satellite Fleet
JO  - 2021 6th International Conference for Convergence in Technology, I2CT 2021
PY  - 2021
AB  - With the increasing demand for geostationary satellites services, all efforts are being made to minimize the cost of the entire geo-satellite system. On-orbit refuelling of geo-satellites is one of the ways to achieve this. In this regard a geo-refuelling system utilising multiple refueller satellites for on-orbit refuelling using current capabilities of satellites and launchers of ISRO is configured. For this initially an economic feasibility study was carried out based on unit telecommunication cost of refuelled and conventional geo satellites. The study was able to identify the main parameters of a regularly refuelled geo-satellite fleet which dictate its economic feasibility. For a geo-satellite fleet with refuelling, various fleet combinations are possible with the four different categories of satellites viz, Ilk, I2k, I3k, I4k and with multiple refuellers. All such possible combinations of refuellers and refuelled satellites are explored and combinations which provide desirable profitability are narrowed down for further selection. Two notional mission scenarios are identified and suitable satellite categories and combinations for each scenario is identified which provide economic viability. © 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Contrasting Approved Uses Against Actual Uses At La Restinga Lagoon National Park, Margarita Island, Venezuela. A Gps And Gis Method To Improve Management Plans And Rangers Coverage
JO  - Journal of Coastal Conservation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Protected areas are the core of efforts to conserve biological diversity and zoning uses, and they are used as a tool for their management. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) have been used to evaluate conflicts between approved uses and actual uses in La Restinga Lagoon National Park in Venezuela (LRLNP). The park (188.6 km 2), covers various ecosystems such as coastal lagoons, marine waters and xerophytic vegetation, it is visited by up to 260,000 people visit per year. A GIS, using a base map compiled from 1:25,000 maps was developed. Natural cover was mapped from LANDSAT VII TM images, orthophotomaps and aerial photographs. Spatial use data was collected by field GPS location of any use inside the park during 2 years. Thematic vector maps for each land cover, zoning area, and observed use were created. Maps of zoning and uses were overlapped and new maps for each use-zoning crossing were created. The park contain nine different zoning areas wherein 28 different uses were identified, 18 of them were direct consumptive and non-consumptive uses, occurring on 54% of the park. Tourism transit areas were the most used zones. More than 5,000 people use the park during a high season day. Superimposition of zoning maps with actual use data produced 13 uses taking place in not allowed areas (46% of park area). Most common prohibited use was commercial net fishing, occurring in nearly 40% of the park area. Therefore, identifying human use conflicts and its geographical distribution is a key issue to improve Management Plans as well as identifying hot sites. The GPS-GIS methodology presented here allows Park Rangers to select those areas which could benefit from enhanced supervision with the limited budget available. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Multicolor Fluorescence Imaging As A Candidate For Disease Detection In Plant Phenotyping
JO  - Frontiers in Plant Science
PY  - 2016
AB  - The negative impact of conventional farming on environment and human health make improvements on farming management mandatory. Imaging techniques are implemented in remote sensing for monitoring crop fields and plant phenotyping programs. The increasingly large size and complexity of the data obtained by these techniques, makes the implementation of powerful mathematical tools necessary in order to identify informative parameters and to apply them in precision agriculture. Multicolor fluorescence imaging is a useful approach for the study of plant defense responses to stress factors at bench scale. However, it has not been fully applied to plant phenotyping. This work evaluates the possible application of multicolor fluorescence imaging in combination with thermography for the particular case of zucchini plants affected by soft-rot, caused by Dickeya dadantii. Several statistical models -based on logistic regression analysis (LRA) and artificial neural networks (ANN)- were obtained for the experimental system zucchini-D. dadantii, which classify new samples as “healthy” or “infected.” The LRA worked best in identifying high dose-infiltrated leaves (in infiltrated and non-infiltrated areas) whereas ANN offered a higher accuracy at identifying low dose-infiltrated areas. To assess the applicability of these results to cucurbits in a more general way, these models were validated for melon infected by the same pathogen, achieving accurate predictions for the infiltrated areas. The values of accuracy achieved are comparable to those found in the literature for classifiers identifying other infections based on data obtained by different techniques. Thus, MCFI in combination with thermography prove useful at providing data at lab scale that can be analyzed by machine learning. This approach could be scaled up to be applied in plant phenotyping. © 2016 Pérez-Bueno, Pineda, Cabeza and Barón.

TI  - Water Demand Of Central Pivot-Irrigated Areas In Bahia, Brazil: Management Of Water Resources Applied To Sustainable Production
JO  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - When performed without technical criteria, the rapid expansion of irrigated agricultural frontiers can result in overexploitation of water, causing worrying impacts on the balance of agroecosystems. This study proposes a model applied to the state of Bahia, to estimate the water demand of areas irrigated by a central pivot, in order to contribute to information that will subsidize the inspection and planning of water resources in the promotion of sustainable agriculture. The irrigated areas were identified and measured by photointerpretation using orbital images from the Landsat-8 satellite. With a historical series of data, the reference evapotranspiration was calculated and monthly water balance was elaborated. The data obtained were spatialized by kriging, and with punctual values of water deficit (mm), the water demand of the irrigated perimeter of the equipment was estimated. The results were described considering strategic planning units, proposed from municipalities, hydrographic basins and biomes. A total of 4075 pivots were quantified, covering an irrigated area of 265,896.30 ha and with an average annual consumption of 1,333,473,208.02 m(3) of water. Areas of high demand were identified, especially in the western region of Bahia, which includes the hydrographic basin of the Sao Francisco River and the Cerrado biome, concentrating 80.85\% and 75.47\% of the state water demand for pivots, respectively. Considering possible points of water vulnerability and continuity of this expansion, the results provide the primary information needed to encourage the adoption of public policies aimed at the management of water resources. The study method proposes guidelines that condition the application in any region of interest in the world.

TI  - Landslide Risk Assessment In Eastern Kentucky, Usa: Developing A Regional Scale, Limited Resource Approach
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rapidly changing remote sensing technologies (lidar, aerial photography, satellites) provide opportunities to improve regional-scale landslide risk mapping. However, data limitations regarding landslide hazard and exposure data influence how landslide risk is calculated. To develop risk assessments for a landslide-prone region of eastern Kentucky, USA, we assessed risk modeling and applicability using variable quality data. First, we used a risk equation that incorporated the hazard as a logistic regression landslide susceptibility model using geomorphic variables derived from lidar data. Susceptibility is calculated as a probability of occurrence. The exposure data included population, roads, railroads, and land class. Our vulnerability value was assumed to equal one (worst-case scenario for a degree of loss) and consequence data was economic cost. Results indicate 64.1 percent of the study area is classified as moderate to high socioeconomic risk. To develop a more data-limited approach, we used a 30 m slope-angle map as the hazard input and simplified exposure data. Results for the slope-based approach show the distribution of risk that is less uniform, with large areas of over-and under-prediction. Changes in the hazard and exposure inputs result in significant changes in the quality and applicability of the maps and demonstrate the broad range of risk modelling approaches.

TI  - Efficiency Evaluation And Optimization Of Rural Ecotourism Space Based On Dea Model
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Since the reform and opening up, with the development of China's economy, the demand for tourism has been increased. The traditional agriculture has not been able to satisfy the diversified consumption demand; as a result, the rural ecotourism develops rapidly. Based on such a situation, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was used in this study; the relevant data of Guangxi province such as the number of star hotels and number of tourists were referred to. The efficiency of rural ecotourism space was calculated. According to evaluation analysis of spatial dynamic efficiency, it could be found that although the comprehensive technical efficiency of the southeast coastal areas was lower than 1, it was still higher than other regions. The pure technical efficiency ofmany regions was equal to 1, and the scale benefits were increasing. Regions with moderate political and economic levels had high pure technical efficiency and maintained above the national level, but they were relatively small in scale and needed to increase input indicators. However, the comprehensive technical efficiency of relatively backward areas in northwest China was relatively low, which remained at about 0.3. Therefore, more investment and government support are needed to expand the scale.

TI  - Localism And The Policy Goal Of Securing The Socio- Economic Viability Of Rural And Regional Australia
JO  - Rural and Regional Futures
PY  - 2014
AB  - Introduction: setting the context for the emergence of localism As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2006) has made apparent, rural decline is a common feature across all OECD countries. Within the Australian context, not only is such decline common, it is also not a new phenomenon. As Gutman (2007, p. 384) points out, in the past 100 years agriculture has declined from generating 80 per cent of Gross Domestic Product to less than 5 per cent. Lockie (2000) observes that international economic pressures on Australian agriculture have been cyclically impacting on the industry since late in the nineteenth century. Alston and Kent (2004, p. xiii) observe that ‘small town rural decline and depopulation have been a common factor of rural life at least since the 1970s’. Rural decline has been particularly evidenced in a reduction in the number of people living in rural Australia, an ageing of the residual rural population, and a sustained decline in the number of jobs in agriculture, averaging 2.3 per cent per annum (Bureau of Rural Sciences 2008). However, industries such as agriculture and mining have not been the only drivers of either non-Indigenous settlement or population decline in rural and regional Australia. Initially people also settled in rural and remote locations to provide services not only to agriculture and mining but also as a result of the need for labour to build and maintain critical forms of infrastructure. With regard to services, the town of Dubbo (for example), situated in the north-west of New South Wales, was first established as a settlement serving an emergent pastoral industry. Similarly settlements were established in regard to the development of the overland telegraph, servicing horse driven coaches, railway towns, dams, irrigation systems and the hydroelectricity scheme to name a few. These populations of course in turn needed access to goods and services. And so a positive cycle of development ensued. In support of the role played by people living in these settlements, there was acceptance that urban and country Australians played a significant, interdependent, yet distinctive role in contributing to the viability of the nation state. Central to this value position was the view that all Australians were equally ‘deserving’ of access to services and other social entitlements. This was reflected in policy aims and ideals that strove for a state of national ‘equality’ that was concomitant with ‘being Australian’. This policy manifested itself in ‘country’ Australia through the provision of compensations for the costs and impost of living outside the metropolitan areas (Brett 2007, p. 4). As a result of economic and technological development (such as satellites, broadband communication, helicopters used to inspect telephone and power lines, improved transport systems) the need for local people to be locally based to fulfil many roles has also declined over time. The development of the motor car alone has changed what it means to live in a given place vis-à-vis the accessibility of goods and services available in other settlements. In the 1930s, it was a common event for example, for children to ride a horse (30 minute ride) or walk distances of five miles to the local school. Churches and settlements were also situated within riding distance of rural properties.2 As a result of the motor car, larger distances could be travelled in relatively short periods of time, making schools, services and shops in other localities more accessible. The multiplicative effect of many small changes over a long period of time (80 years) has resulted in subsequent changes in the placement of, and support for, services and shopping. And while many people have moved away from these smaller towns and villages, others have chosen to stay. Such a decision may have been informed by economic necessity or social and cultural factors such as attachment to people and place. Similarly, the push for agricultural efficiency (see Smith and Pritchard, this volume) realised in the increased mechanisation of farm processes meant the need for fewer waged labourers and fewer labourers meant fewer country residents over time. From 1997, and particularly between 2002 and 2008, these problems of decline were exacerbated when large parts of Australian agriculture were subjected to a significant drought (BRS 2008; Kenny 2008) with negative economic impacts on agricultural production and the subsequent social and economic flow on effects on the viability of rural towns. Over time, the cumulative impacts on rural towns of globalising economic forces, informed as they were by neoliberal policies and drought, has meant not just socio-economic decline (Alston and Kent 2004, p. xiii) but the increasing risk that ‘regional towns and cities are sliding towards welfare-dependency’ (Marsden Jacobs et al. 2010, p. xii). With many jobs and businesses at risk, concern about the viability of rural towns is once again uppermost in the minds of the community. It was within this context that localism re-emerged as a policy strategy designed to enable local communities to address the socio-economic challenges which beset them. As a policy strategy localism is neither new nor uniquely Australian. Indeed, as our analysis shows, in developing its policy approach to localism, Australian policymakers drew heavily on policy work undertaken in Europe. However, Australia is geographically distinct from Europe and policies that relate to either space or place need to take spatial, demographic and cultural differences into account. Spatially, Australia differs enormously from Europe. Switzerland, for example, occupies 41,290 square kilometres and is smaller than Australia’s smallest state of Tasmania, which occupies more than 60,000 square kilometres. Some of Australia’s national parks are physically larger than some European countries (such as Belgium). In addition, Australia is far less densely populated than Europe (OECD 2006). In remote Australia, approximately 3 per cent of the population lives on 70 per cent of the landmass. Earlier chapters drew attention to the way policy processes have constructed regions as productive spaces. Population approaches to settlements also construct a certain image as to what constitutes a region. In a report from the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS 2008) the ‘rural’ was constructed as being those spaces not occupied by small towns or larger settlements. A working definition of regional could also be derived from these analyses. By default, regional did not encompass major urban centres but was also likely to encompass settlements which were greater than 250,000 people which were not also one of the centres of state governance. Regional was also likely to encompass settlements of up to 100,000 people, and of 100,000 to 250,000 people. Notably, while smaller towns and villages may be in decline, so-called regional centres are growing in population. The Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS 2008) reports that regionally Australia has seen growth in centres such as the Gold Coast (Queensland), Geelong and Bendigo (Victoria), Mandurah (Western Australia), the Tweed, Newcastle and Maitland (New South Wales), and Alexandrina, Victor Harbour and Mount Barker (South Australia). Interestingly, only 9 per cent of Australians now live in rural Australia (BRS 2008, p. 3). There are of course a variety of other ways to think about the notion of what constitutes a region, particularly when considered from a community perspective. For Goffman (1969, p. 107) regions ‘may be defined as any place that is bounded to some degree by barriers to perception … they are bounded according to the media of communication in which the barriers to perception occur’. For Kinnear et al. (2013, p. 6) ‘a definition of regional Australia requires a subjective and fluid interpretation: a collection of areas surrounding non-capital settlements; with common features, cohesive functions and/or shared purpose and variable boundaries according to context’. Note that in these definitions of space, the words place and p rpose arise. Creswell (2004) makes a specific distinction between space and place, with the idea of space being more readily associated with the idea of a region. For Creswell (2004, p. 39), a place is ‘constituted through reiterative social practice – place is made and remade on a daily basis. Place provides a template for practice – an unstable stage for performance’. Contrasting Kinnear et al. with Creswell, regions might be thought of in terms of physical spaces which are purposeful, perhaps, as an example, with regard to industrial or productive activity, whereas place is ‘a way of being’ (Cresswell 2004, p. 16). Notably, the everyday use of the word place is often associated with the possessive, such as ‘my place’ as well as ‘your place’ and ‘our place’. Place is also associated with identity and culture, taking in such phrases as my place in the world, or my connection to country. Notions of place have as much to do with feelings and relationships to space as they do with lines on a map. We return to these issues of place as distinct from space below as we develop our discussion on the issue of localism. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anthony Hogan and Michelle Young; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - Biochemical And Economical Effect Of Application Biostimulants Containing Seaweed Extracts And Amino Acids As An Element Of Agroecological Management Of Bean Cultivation
JO  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
PY  - 2020
AB  - The implementation of agronomic activities, based on the use of biostimulants, is an important element of agroecological practices. Therefore, comprehensive research was carried on the use of biostimulants. A field experiment was performed in 2016-2018 with common bean of Mexican Black cultivar. In particular growing seasons, bean plants were treated with Kelpak SL (seaweed extracts) and Terra Sorb Complex (free amino acids) in the form of single and double spraying with two solutions concentrations. According to the obtained data, application of biostimulants increased the yield of bean. Better results were observed after the use of Kelpak SL. The application of preparations influenced nutritional and nutraceutical quality of bean seeds. Terra Sorb Complex caused the highest increase in proteins level. In the light of achieved data, biostimulants in similar level decreased the starch accumulation. The most promising results, in the context of nutraceutical value of bean, were obtained in the case of increasing level of fiber. A positive impact of biostimulants on the seeds antioxidant potential was noted, expressed by the increased synthesis of phenolics, flavonoid, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities. Results of this study, directly indicate economic benefits from the use of biostimulants, which are extremely important to the farmers.

TI  - India's Eo Pyramid For Holistic Development
JO  - Space Technologies for the Benefit of Human Society and Earth
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Indian Earth Observations (EO) Programme, encompassing the space, ground and the applications segment, has practically demonstrated various roles that EO could play in catalyzing the developmental process of a nation at various levels. The present in-orbit Indian EO constellation of operational satellites and the planned missions have been a part of India's EO strategy to have specific thematic missions to meet the land & water resources management, cartography applications, and oceanography & atmospheric science and management requirements besides meeting the needs of the disaster management support programme. A unique institutional framework, namely the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) under the aegis of Planning Commission, Government of India steers the whole EO programme in India. While such a strategy is primarily public goods services oriented, it also creates enough space for a closer cooperation with industry and academia to form a formidable EO triad. The country has demonstrated innovatively how to put to use the EO for addressing the most fundamental national priorities such as food security & poverty alleviation, creation of natural assets and also in building the physical and social infrastructure, providing inputs for weather and climate science as well as in tackling natural disasters in all phases. While addressing such goals, the convergence of EO with geospatial technologies enabled creation of comprehensive spatial data infrastructure as national repository to help identifying environmentally degraded wastelands and reclaiming the culturable wastelands; identifying sources of drinking water especially in hard rock terrain and suitable sites for ground water recharge; taking up watershed development in a holistic manner linking the livelihood of the populace with soil and water conservation; irrigated command area management addressing various issues including salinity and alkalinity; dissemination of agricultural crop acreage and yield estimates; bio-diversity characterization at landscape level; and disaster management such as flood mapping and agricultural drought assessment. India has successfully demonstrated many such innovative applications, taking the EO based services to 'the last' in the social hierarchy, essentially the poor and marginalized. In the recent times, India has envisaged setting up Village Resource Centres in the backward and inaccessible rural areas of the country. In this process, Indian EO programme has aligned itself well with various activities under the Bharat Nirman programme such as National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme; Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP); National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM); National Watershed Development Programme for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA). © 2009 Springer Netherlands.

TI  - Passive Monitoring Of Mental Health Status In The Criminal Forensic Population
JO  - Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law
PY  - 2019
AB  - Current approaches to monitoring patients’ mental status rely heavily on self-reported symptomatology, clinician observation, and self-rated symptom scales. The limitations inherent in these methodologies have implications for the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. Certain populations are particularly affected by these limitations because of their unique situations, including criminal forensic patients, who have a history of both criminal behavior and mental disorder, and experience increased stigma and restrictions in their access to mental health care. This population may benefit particularly from recent developments in technology and the growing use of mobile devices and sensors to collect behavioral information via passive monitoring. These technologies offer objective parameters that correlate with mental health status and create an opportunity to use Big Data and machine learning to refine diagnosis and predict behavior in a way that represents a marked shift from current practices. This article reviews the approaches to and limitations of psychiatric assessment and contrasts this with the promise of these new technologies. It then discusses the ethics concerns associated with these technologies and explores their potential relevance to criminal forensic psychiatry and the broader implications they carry for health and criminal justice policy. © 2019, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.

TI  - Reducing The Cost Of Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing: Combining Near-Infrared Video Imagery With Colour Aerial Photography
JO  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
PY  - 2003
AB  - Land managers are often confronted with management problems that could be addressed using decision support or management information systems. The use of such tools, however, depends on the availability of appropriately resolved spatial data. One source of such data is multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. The cost of such imagery, particularly where environmental goals are most important, is often prohibitive. Even when the cost of such imagery can be met; other factors, such as cloud cover for satellite-based systems or sensor scheduling for sophisticated airborne systems, may mean that imagery is not available. This paper investigates the utility of a system that combines near-infrared imagery from a video camera with conventional medium-format aerial photography deployed in a light aircraft platform. Previously, imagery obtained from video cameras has suffered from limited spectral range and from significant image motion effects. These problems were eliminated by the use of an electronic-shutter charge-coupled device video camera with a strong IR response. The systems components and the approach to their operational deployment are described and the options, for transforming the raw imagery into survey coverage discussed. The image quality and cost is presented for a site characterisation application where the aim is the generation of normalised difference vegetation index values. It is concluded that the system has significant potential-utility for decision support and land-management applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Application Of Machine Learning Algorithms For Digital Mapping Of Soil Salinity Levels And Assessing Their Spatial Transferability In Arid Regions
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2023
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of soil salinity distribution in arid regions is essential for making informed decisions regarding agricultural suitability, water resource management, and land use planning. A methodology was developed to identify soil salinity in Sudan by utilizing optical and radar-based satellite data as well as variables obtained from digital elevation models that are known to indicate variations in soil salinity. The methodology includes the transfer of models to areas where similar conditions prevail. A geographically coordinated database was established, incorporating a variety of environmental variables based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Electrical Conductivity (EC) measurements from the saturation extract of soil samples collected at three different depths (0-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm). Thereafter, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNLR) and Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBM), were utilized to spatially classify the salinity levels in the region. To determine the applicability of the model trained at the reference site to the target area, a Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) analysis was conducted. The producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and Tau index parameters were used to evaluate the model's accuracy, and spatial confusion indices were computed to assess uncertainty. At different soil depths, Tau index values for the reference area ranged from 0.38 to 0.77, whereas values for target area samples ranged from 0.66 to 0.88, decreasing as the depth increased. Clay normalized ratio (CLNR), Salinity Index 1, and SAR data were important variables in the modeling. It was found that the subsoils in the middle and northwest regions of both the reference and target areas had a higher salinity level compared to the topsoil. This study highlighted the effectiveness of model transfer as a means of identifying and evaluating the management of regions facing significant salinity-related challenges. This approach can be instrumental in identifying alternative areas suitable for agricultural activities at a regional level.

TI  - Groundwater-Pumping Optimization For Land-Subsidence Control In Beijing Plain, China
JO  - Hydrogeology Journal
PY  - 2018
AB  - Beijing, in the North China plain, is one of the few megacities that uses groundwater as its main source of water supply. Groundwater accounts for about two-thirds of the city’s water supply, and during the past 50 years the storage depletion from the unconsolidated aquifers underlying the city has been >10.4 billion m3. By 2010, groundwater pumping in the city had resulted in a cumulative subsidence of greater than 100 mm in an area of about 3,900 km2, with a maximum cumulative subsidence of >1,200 mm. This subsidence has caused significant social and economic losses in Beijing, including significant damage to underground utilities. This study was undertaken to evaluate various future pumping scenarios to assist in selecting an optimal pumping scenario to minimize overall subsidence, meet the requirements of the Beijing Land Subsidence Prevention Plan (BLSPP 2013–2020), and be consistent with continued sustainable economic development. A numerical groundwater and land-subsidence model was developed for the aquifer system of the Beijing plain to evaluate land subsidence rates under the possible future pumping scenarios. The optimal pumping scenario consistent with the evaluation constraints is a reduction in groundwater pumping from three major pumping centers by 100, 50 and 20%, respectively, while maintaining an annual pumping rate of 1.9 billion m3. This scenario’s land-subsidence rates satisfy the BLSPP 2013–2020 and the pumping scenario is consistent with continued economic development. It is recommended that this pumping scenario be adopted for future land-subsidence management in Beijing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Impact Of Urbanization On Air Quality In The Yangtze River Delta During The Covid-19 Lockdown In China
JO  - $-2$ and Urban agglomerations and Yangtze river delta and Rivers and Journal of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2021
AB  - The urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is symbol of China's rapid urbanization during the past decades. Urbanization can significantly impact land-cover properties, surface heating, and emissions of air pollutants. To control the spread of COVID-19, China imposed very rigorous restrictions, leading to dramatic reductions in air pollutants (except O3) from satellite and ground-based data. As such, inter-transportation of air pollutants was weak during the lockdown, which was conducive to discuss the impacts of urbanization on the air quality. During the lockdown, the rates of surface PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO reductions in different urban types ranged from 6.6% to 62.4% in the YRD. Urbanization exerted great impacts on the pollutant variations in urban agglomerations despite such large decreases in primary pollution in YRD. Lower values of AOD and tropospheric NO2 columns were noticeably observed over large cities during the lockdown. The extents of surface PM, SO2, NO2 and CO reductions in large cities (first-tier and second-tier) were found to be larger (4.7%–10.6%) than those in small-medium cities (third-tier and fourth-tier) during the lockdown, which was also the case for the extent of the increase (33.0%–53.0%) in O3. PCA analysis revealed that the PM decreases in large cities made greater improvement in the air quality compared with the small cities during lockdown, while the urbanization had non-obvious influence on the photochemical reactions. It is imperative to adopt policies and programs to mitigate the air pollution in urban agglomerations in the fast urbanization process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Operational Evaluation Of A Wildfire Air Quality Model From A Forecaster Point Of View
JO  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
PY  - 2022
AB  - An evaluation of an operational wildfire air quality model (WFAQM) has been performed. Evaluation metrics were chosen through an analysis of interviews and a survey of professionals who use WFAQM forecasts as part of their daily responsibilities. The survey revealed that professional users generally focus on whether forecast air quality will exceed thresholds that trigger local air quality advisories (e.g., an event), their analysis scale is their region of responsibility, they are interested in short-term (approximate to 24 h) guidance, missing an event is worse than issuing a false alarm, and there are two types of users-one that takes the forecast at face value, and the other that uses it as one of several information sources. Guided by these findings, model performance of Environment and Climate Change Canada's current operational WFAQM (FireWork) was assessed over western Canada during three (2016-18) summer (May-September) wildfire seasons. Evaluation was performed at the geographic scale at which individual forecasts are issued (the forecast region) using gridded particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) fields developed from a machine learning-based downscaling of satellite and meteorological data. For the "at face value" user group, model performance was measured using the Peirce skill score. For the "as information source" user group, model performance was measured using the divergence skill score. For this metric, forecasts were first converted to event probabilities using binomial regression. We find when forecasts are taken at face value, FireWork cannot outperform a nearest-neighbor-based persistence model. However, when forecasts are considered as an information source, FireWork is superior to the persistence-based model.

TI  - Correlating Landscape Pattern With Total Nitrogen Concentration Using A Location-Weighted Sink-Source Landscape Index In The Haihe River Basin, China
JO  - Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science
PY  - 2012
AB  - Understanding the effect of land cover pattern on nutrient losses is of great importance in management of water resources. The extensive application of mechanism models is limited in large-scale watersheds owing to the intensive data and calibration requirements. On the other hand, the traditional landscape indexes only take the areas and types of land cover into account, considering less about their topographic features and spatial patterns. We constructed a location-weighted landscape index (LWLI) based on the Lorenz curve, which plots the cumulative proportion of areas for sink and source landscapes respectively against cumulative proportion of their relative location to the outlet in a watershed, including relative elevation, distance and slope. We assessed the effect of land cover pattern on total nitrogen losses in the Haihe River. Firstly, 26 watersheds were derived from 1:250000 digital elevation model (DEM), and their "source" and "sink" landscape types were identified from Landsat TM images in 2007. The "source" landscapes referred to the paddy land, dry land and residential area, correspondingly the "sink" landscapes referred to the forest and grassland. Secondly, LWLI was calculated according to the landscape types and spatial patterns for each watershed. Thirdly, we accessed the effect of land cover pattern on total nitrogen (TN) flux according to the value of LWLI, comparing with the area proportion of sink-source landscapes. The correlation coefficients were different in three parts of Haihe River, i.e., 0.86, 0.67 and 0.65 in the Yanshan Mts, Taihang Mts and lower Haihe River. The results showed strong correlations between TN and LWLI in contrast to the weak correlations between TN and area proportion of sink and source landscape types. This study indicates the spatial pattern of land cover is essential for accessing the nutrient losses, and the location-weighted landscape pattern analysis may be an alternate to existing water quality models, especially in large watershed scales. The sink-source index is sufficiently simple that it can be compared across watersheds and be easily interpreted, and potentially be used in landscape pattern optimal designing and planning.

AB  - Mao, D.; Fu, X.; Wang, J., and Guo, R., 2019. Assessment of flood vulnerability of the Dongting Lake Area in China with regard to land use/cover change. In: Guido-Aldana, P.A. and Mulahasan, S. (eds.), Advances in Water Resources and Exploration. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 93, pp. 388-396. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A flood vulnerability comprehensive evaluation model (FVCEM) was established by interpreting remote sensing (RS) image data for 1987, 1998, and 2008 using Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) software and a geographical information system (GIS), as well as analysing historical disaster maps and statistical yearbook data regarding flood disasters in the Dongting Lake Area in China. Using the method of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) etc., the influence of land use/cover change on flood vulnerability was studied. The vulnerability of the local population and economy to flooding was assessed by means of FVCEM. The results showed that the vulnerability parameters of hazard-affected bodies were different for different land use types, which influenced the subsequent flood vulnerability. The flood vulnerability value over the period of 1987-2008 exhibited an increasing trend, with obvious spatial heterogeneity. The hinterland of the Dongting Lake Area was found to be susceptible to flood hazard. The flood risk regionalization and risk management should be carried out urgently by local government according to the temporal and spatial vary characteristics of flood vulnerability, land use model suitable for these characteristics should be constructed timely by residents. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.

TI  - Global Crop Yield Reductions Due To Surface Ozone Exposure: 2. Year 2030 Potential Crop Production Losses And Economic Damage Under Two Scenarios Of O3 Pollution
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - We examine the potential global risk of increasing surface ozone (O3) exposure to three key staple crops (soybean, maize, and wheat) in the near future (year 2030) according to two trajectories of O3 pollution: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC SRES) A2 and B1 storylines, which represent upper- and lower-boundary projections, respectively, of most O3 precursor emissions in 2030. We use simulated hourly O3 concentrations from the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers version 2.4 (MOZART-2), satellite-derived datasets of agricultural production, and field-based concentration:response relationships to calculate crop yield reductions resulting from O3 exposure. We then calculate the associated crop production losses and their economic value. We compare our results to the estimated impact of O3 on global agriculture in the year 2000, which we assessed in our companion paper [Avnery et al., 2011]. In the A2 scenario we find global year 2030 yield loss of wheat due to O3 exposure ranges from 5.4 to 26% (a further reduction in yield of +1.5-10% from year 2000 values), 15-19% for soybean (reduction of +0.9-11%), and 4.4-8.7% for maize (reduction of +2.1-3.2%) depending on the metric used, with total global agricultural losses worth $17-35 billion USD2000 annually (an increase of +$6-17 billion in losses from 2000). Under the B1 scenario, we project less severe but still substantial reductions in yields in 2030: 4.0-17% for wheat (a further decrease in yield of +0.1-1.8% from 2000), 9.5-15% for soybean (decrease of +0.7-1.0%), and 2.5-6.0% for maize (decrease of + 0.3-0.5%), with total losses worth $12-21 billion annually (an increase of +$1-3 billion in losses from 2000). Because our analysis uses crop data from the year 2000, which likely underestimates agricultural production in 2030 due to the need to feed a population increasing from approximately 6 to 8 billion people between 2000 and 2030, our calculations of crop production and economic losses are highly conservative. Our results suggest that O3 pollution poses a growing threat to global food security even under an optimistic scenario of future ozone precursor emissions. Further efforts to reduce surface O3 concentrations thus provide an excellent opportunity to increase global grain yields without the environmental degradation associated with additional fertilizer application or land cultivation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Distribution And Structure Analysis Of Mountain Permafrost Landscape In Orulgan Ridge (Northeast Siberia) Using Google Earth Engine
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2022
AB  - An analysis of the landscape spatial structure and diversity in the mountain ranges of Northeast Siberia is essential to assess how tundra and boreal landscapes may respond to climate change and anthropogenic impacts in the vast mountainous permafrost of the Arctic regions. In addition, a precise landscape map is required for knowledge-based territorial planning and management. In this article, we aimed to explore and enhanced methods to analyse and map the permafrost landscape in Orulgan Ridge. The Google Earth Engine cloud platform was used to generate vegetation cover maps based on multi-fusion classification of Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI time series data. Phenological features based on the monthly median values of time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were used to recognize geobotanical units according to the hierarchical concept of permafrost landscapes by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, geomorphological variables of megarelief (mountains and river valleys) were identified using the GIS-based terrain analysis and landform classification of the ASTER GDEM scenes mosaic. The resulting environmental variables made it possible to categorize nine classes of mountain permafrost landscapes. The result obtained was compared with previous permafrost landscape maps, which revealed a significant difference in distribution and spatial structure of intrazonal valleys and mountain tundra landscapes. Analysis of the landscape structure revealed a significant distribution of classes of mountain Larix-sparse forests and tundra. Landscape diversity was described by six longitudinal and latitudinal landscape hypsometric profiles. River valleys allow boreal-taiga landscapes to move up to high-mountainous regions. The features of the landscape structure and diversity of the ridge are noted, which, along with the specific spatial organization of vegetation and relief, can be of key importance for environmental monitoring and the study of regional variability of climatic changes.

TI  - Modelling The Ground-Lai To Satellite-Ndvi (Sentinel-2) Relationship Considering Variability Sources Due To Crop Type (<I>Triticum Durum</I> L., <I>Zea Mays</I> L. And <I>Medicago Sativa</I> L.) And Farm Management
PY  - 2019
AB  - Plant Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key variable for several land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics. Satellite systems offer the opportunity to estimate LAI by remote, allowing to reduce costs for crop monitoring over large areas. Indeed, LAI, is a process variable of several models used for the prediction of crop biomass accumulation, yield and canopy coverage over space and time. Uncertainty of LAI estimation by means of Vegetation Indices extrapolated from multispectral satellite images is related to several factors: ( i) crop type (due to the variability of plant architectures, the light extinction coefficient highly variable among crop species), (ii) the effect of environmental covariates, which affects the crop development together with the farm management. This study aimed at evaluating how the ground-LAI (Leaf Area Index) measurements and satellite vegetation indexes from Sentinel 2 reflectance were affected by the variety of crop type and the uncertainties related to different farm managements. We used Sentinel-2 imagery spanning across the growth seasons, over three agricultural sites located in the Mediterranean agroecosystem (Central Italy) and we produced satellite NDVI index to estimate LAI by remote over the sites. In the same period, with a monthly stratified random ground sampling design, the three agricultural farms with prevalent herbaceous crop cover were monitored in terms of groundLAI variations. The novelty and the added value extracted from the results was that the uncertainty induced by farm management (FARM) variability can be relevant as much as the one caused by crop type (CROP) and seasonality (TIME) variations when ground-LAI measurements and satellite NDVI were analyzed by a set of non-liner regression models.

TI  - Robustness And Reliability In Smart Grid Solutions
JO  - Proceedings of 2019 the 7th International Conference on Smart Energy Grid Engineering, SEGE 2019
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Electric Power distribution systems should be integrated with the corporate solutions of power generators and distributors, so as to guarantee greater reliability, availability and speed in response to emergency moments, fault occurrence, the need to send maintenance teams and maneuvers in the system, aiming at reducing the SAIDI and SAIFI indices and ensuring an increase in quality of the electric power supply to the end users, at a well-balanced cost and adapted to the economic reality of Brazil and Latin America. Satellite telemetry connectivity technology presents itself as a convenient and optimized solution for the monitoring and control of reclosers and other protection equipment installed in the electrical network, as well as measurement systems for large consumers such as industries, hospitals and stadiums integrated to a Smart Grid solution. Many concessionaires and electric power cooperatives have had problems to achieve highly available and reliable communication channels between the devices installed in the field to the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) installed in the DOC (Distribution Operation Center) of the Utilities, in regions with unstable telecommunication coverage or critical points that require redundancy or with no telecommunication coverage, which becomes a techno-financial market differential for large concessionaires and electric power cooperatives. The satellite telemetry connectivity solution acts as a contingency for cellular networks and other relevant technologies, or as a main communication vector in electric distribution companies, since traditional solutions have presented failures at critical moments in the network, mainly due to inclement weather and periods of peak consumption or in case of overload of the electrical system. This solution integrates the DOCs with a monitoring middleware in the cloud with protective and metering devices allocated in the field using the technology of satellite telemetry terminals as the main channel of communication or as a contingency solution. During the last 5 years the solution has been installed in more than 1500 points around Latin America, including Brazil in their main electric companies with excellent results of improvement of SAIDI and SAIFI, allowing these companies to manage the devices deployed in the field and making strategic decisions in real time. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Using Satellite-Based Estimates Of Evapotranspiration And Groundwater Changes To Determine Anthropogenic Water Fluxes In Land Surface Models
JO  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2015
AB  - Irrigation is a widely used water management practice that is often poorly parameterized in land surface and climate models. Previous studies have addressed this issue via use of irrigation area, applied water inventory data, or soil moisture content. These approaches have a variety of drawbacks including data latency, accurately prescribing irrigation intensity, and a lack of conservation of water volume for models using a prescribed soil moisture approach. In this study, we parameterize irrigation fluxes using satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) compared to ET from a suite of land surface models without irrigation. We then incorporate the irrigation flux into the Community Land Model (CLM) and use a systematic trial-and-error procedure to determine the ground- and surface-water withdrawals that are necessary to balance the new irrigation flux. The resulting CLM simulation with irrigation produces ET that matches the magnitude and seasonality of observed satellite ET well, with a mean difference of 6.3 mm month(-1) and a correlation of 0.95. Differences between the new CLM ET values and satellite-observed ET values are always less than 30 mm month(-1) and the differences show no pattern with respect to seasonality. The results reinforce the importance of accurately parameterizing anthropogenic hydrologic fluxes into land surface and climate models to assess environmental change under current and future climates and land management regimes.

TI  - An Assessment Of Coastal Land-Use And Land-Cover Change From 1974-2008 In The Vicinity Of Mobile Bay, Alabama
JO  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2011
AB  - The purpose of this research is to quantify and assess geospatial land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in the coastal counties of Mobile and Baldwin, Alabama using nine Landsat images from 1974-2008. A study-specific classification scheme was devised comprising upland herbaceous, upland forest, non-woody and woody wetlands, open water, and urban categories. Upland forest was the most dominant terrestrial cover type. Wetlands averaged 17\% and urban averaged 7\%. A majority of the urban expansion occurred between 1974 and 1979 (26\%). Thirty-four percent of the 2008 urban areas were upland forest in 1974. Watershed-scale analysis of Three Mile Creek and D'Olive Bay highlights the temporal and spatial differences of urbanization for watersheds found within the same region. This study is a Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) Application Pilot project that uses NASA data products to benefit coastal environmental managers and community members. Results have led to increased effectiveness of coastal conservation decision-making, increased understanding of post-hurricane LULC change, continued research on habitat change impacts, and contributed to timely conservation planning efforts. This study has benefited the development of watershed management plans by the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program, which is especially important given projected climate change.

TI  - Responding To Radiological Attacks: The Role Of Fixed Sensor Networks
JO  - 1st Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response/Robotic and Remote Systems Topical Meeting
PY  - 2006
AB  - Radiological attacks are those designed to disperse radioactive materials, and include attacks on nuclear power plants and spent nuclear fuel storage areas, and the use of radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) or "dirty bombs." Attacks using radiological weapons would cause relatively few casualties but are considered to be much more likely than attacks using nuclear weapons. Radioactive materials can be dispersed in urban areas by using conventional explosives or by other methods. The impact of a radiological attack could range from relatively minimal and localized to devastating and covering a wide area. However, regardless of the severity of the attack, likely consequences would be to spread fear and panic and cause economic loss, potentially valued in the trillions of dollars if it occurred in a city like New York. Although a troubling consequence of RDD attacks is their ability to produce long-term economic disruption, near-term impacts are also important, particularly in urban areas where large numbers of people may be involved and psychological impacts are likely to be significant. An effective emergency response is critical. Appropriate responders and necessary equipment need to get to the site rapidly, correct decisions need to be made about managing the affected population, and medical care must be provided to those that need it but not to those that don't. In order to increase public cooperation and mitigate psychological impacts in the aftermath of an attack, a major priority is to communicate to the public timely and reliable information from a trusted public spokesperson. Having a system of radiation sensors in place prior to the attack along with personnel trained in its use can provide a single picture of the threat during the time of weakest coordination, useful information for predicting the trajectory of the atmospheric plume, and information to reassure the public. Fixed sensor networks for emergency response are inherently different from networks intended for detection and interdiction of illicit radiological or nuclear sources. Emergency response networks generally require far fewer sensors and have much less stringent technical requirements. In particular, nuisance or "innocent" alarms, the major issue with systems designed for detection, are much less so with systems for emergency management. Sensors for such networks can be placed at locations sufficiently distant from vehicular and pedestrian traffic to avoid alarms from these sources. Building rooftops or setbacks, for example, would make satisfactory sensor locations. In the event of a high-level alarm, the system operator would have information available, e.g., the magnitude and temporal profile of the radiation level, perhaps the identity of the detected radioisotope(s), and perhaps reports of the occurrence of confluent events, such as an explosion, upon which to plan an appropriate response. There are a number of U.S. homeland security fixed sensor networks, including those intended to provide information about radiological, chemical, and biological agents, and meteorological conditions. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expanding and upgrading the air monitoring portion of its Environmental Radiation Ambient Monitoring System, which will now be named "RadNet." When the new network is fully operational by the end of 2009, data will be available from near-real-time fixed monitors in 180 critical locations (currently 59) across the U.S., providing coverage of approximately 70 percent of the population. RadNet's aim is to detect, quantify, and characterize movement of radiation within the United States following a large-scale accidental or purposeful release of radiation into the atmosphere. RadNet is not intended to monitor individual cities or to monitor intentional releases by terrorists in the area near an event; however, RadNet data can supplement environmental radiation information generated by state and city programs. The Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), a federal laboratory located in the Offic of Research and Development, Science and Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has been developing a prototype sensor network to enhance first responder-decision maker capabilities in the aftermath of a radiological attack. Our objectives are to establish an operational prototype, generate a database of "normal" background levels, and transition technology to the first responder community. The prototype network, designated as the Radiological Emergency Management System (REMS), is the result of a partnership among EML and other New York area agencies and organizations, notably the New York City Office of Emergency Management (NYCOEM). The system, which comprises radiation detection, communications, and data management/processing elements, is designed to provide real-time information on radiation levels to designated New York City, state, and federal officials, and other authorized users. Radiation detection and communications systems have been installed and are operating at three sites located in Manhattan. Detectors will be deployed at two additional sites in the near future. These initial sites include high profile and sensitive locations, e.g., financial and transportation hubs. Information from the sensor network is sent to EML and NYCOEM, where it is monitored on a 24/7 basis. The radiation detector used in REMS is the EML-developed Comprehensive Radiation Sensor (CRS). The CRS is a real-time gamma radiation detector and spectroscopic analyzer based on sodium iodide (NaI) scintillation. The CRS's rapid sampling rate and sensitivity assure up-to-the-minute radiological data, which will indicate fast changes in atmospheric radioactivity. In addition, an immediate alert will occur within seconds to signal rapid changes in activity. The CRS also supplies spectral data, allowing the associated network computer to identify the specific radionuclides detected and to distinguish between natural and manmade radioactivity. The data communications system element is used to transmit data from the radiation detectors to the command center(s), display information in a clear, user-friendly format, and provide decision-makers with the information required to act. Three redundant communications technologies are available to ensure maximum reliability. Data is normally transmitted by secure Internet but the system computerautomatically selects cellular telephone or geosynchronous satellite if Internet is unavailable. Information on radiation levels is displayed at the command center(s) in a geographic information system-based format in which sensor locations are displayed as color-coded points on a map, the color corresponding to the radiation level. Users can easily interrogate the system to access more detailed information, including radiation level trends over the past 24 hours and the gamma spectrum with identified isotopes. All detector components, including the NaI scintillator, photomultiplier tube, multi-channel analyzer, computer, and electronics are enclosed within a weatherproof fiberglass housing. A commercial radiation monitor, also mounted in the housing, is used to measure high exposure rates, >5 mR/h, beyond the capability of the NaI detector. Communications equipment is housed in a second weatherproof cabinet, which contains a power supply, modem, and computer. This equipment is located so as to avoid potential interference from passing vehicular traffic and people, e.g., those who may have had recent medical treatments with radioisotopes. No high-level alarms, innocent or otherwise, have been detected by a radiation sensor installed on the roof of EML's building in November 2001 or by sensors that have been added more recently at other sites. For emergency management applications, the number of sensors needed is relatively modest. The number of sensors in the network affects the response time, i.e., the time interval from the release of radiation to when it is detected. We have estimated that approximately 30 sensors would be adequate for monitoring the borough of Manhattan, although a large number would increase the sensitivity of the network. The cost to install such a system would be about $500,000. Additional studies of the use of fixed sensor networks for supporting the emergency response to radiological attacks should include a quantification of the benefits of such networks and analyses of system architectures for maximum effectiveness (e.g., the use of a mix of inexpensive gross gamma counters and spectroscopic detectors, and the integration of detector information with building HVAC systems so as to shut down air intakes if high radiation levels are sensed).

TI  - Synoptic Assessment Of Water Resource Variability In Reservoirs By Remote Sensing: General Approach And Application To The Runoff Harvesting Systems Of South India
JO  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper presents a methodological procedure based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques designed to map and quantify water stocks in small irrigation reservoirs over vast, user-defined regions. Because the method is based on unsupervised pixel classification schemes, it is analytically transparent and entirely replicable and can therefore be used in most settings as a tool for integrated water resource management, planning, or policy making, with benefits to irrigation, land use, agriculture, and water-related social issues. Satellite images of semiarid south India are used here to quantify fluctuating water volumes in similar to 2500 reservoirs. In this pilot study, the detection of temporal trends and spatial discontinuities in land use at successive dates within reservoir beds is a proxy for assessing the performance of reservoirs and for formulating hypotheses on the environmental, socioeconomic, or anthropological reasons behind the inferred levels of infrastructural maintenance or disuse. The synoptic approach paves the way for future efforts as better ground truth data become available.

TI  - Field Test Of The Surface Soil Moisture Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Radar Data
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - Soil surface moisture is one of the key parameters for describing the hydrological state and assessing the potential availability of water for irrigated plants. Because the radar backscattering coefficient is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 data may support soil surface moisture mapping at high spatial resolution by detecting spatial and temporal changes at the field scale for precision irrigation management. This mapping is required to control soil water erosion and preferential water flow to improve irrigation water efficiency and minimise negative impacts on surface and ground water bodies. Direct observations of soil surface moisture (5-cm thickness) were performed at an experimental plot in the study site of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Irrigated Agriculture, near the village Vodnyy, Volgograd region. Soil surface moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 was performed at the same location. A second set of soil surface moisture was calculated for the soil sampling sites using the permittivity model, based on the estimates of soil surface characteristics: a) reflectivity, obtained by the neural network method from Sentinel-1 observations; b) roughness, obtained from the geodata of the stereoscopic survey with unmanned aerial vehicle Phantom 4 Pro. The raster set of soil surface moisture geodata was obtained based on the reflectivity geodata raster set to solve the inverse problem using a permittivity model that considers the soil texture of the experimental plot. The determination coefficient (0.948) and standard deviation (2.04%) were obtained by comparing both sets of soil moisture point geodata taken from the same soil sampling sites. The values confirmed a satisfactory linear correlation between the directly measured and indirectly modelled sets. A comparison of the two sets of geodata indicated a satisfactory reproduction of the first set by the second set. As a result, the developed method can be considered as the scientific and methodological basis of the new technology of soil surface moisture monitoring by radar, which is one of the basic characteristics used in precision irrigation management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aerospace industry in China has developed rapidly over the past 40 years. Remote sensing satellites have grown and gradually developed, and this situation has formed a variety of various satellite series. The communication satellite series, navigation satellite series, Earth observation satellite series, and science and technology test satellite series constitute the current application satellite system in China, which is used in national land and resources survey, meteorological services, environmental monitoring, ocean remote sensing, and other fields. This system provides the foundation for the development of satellite applications. At present, the satellite systems of communication, navigation, and remote sensing are separate and independent. Thus, they cannot meet the real-time, intelligent, and diversified requirements in the era of big data. In addition to the application of land, surveying and mapping, planning, geology and mining, agriculture, transportation, marine, and other industries, the government, enterprises, and the public have shown a large and urgent need for satellite remote sensing navigation data and services, especially high-resolution satellite remote sensing data and services. The demand of users in different industries and fields for remote sensing data products has gradually changed from singularity and standardization to diversification and specialization; from static investigation to dynamic monitoring, forecasting, and forecasting; from qualitative analysis to quantitative research; and from general application to batch business. Therefore, with the application requirements as the traction, focusing on improving the service capabilities of satellite remote sensing, the communication-navigation-remote sensing integrated space-based information service system with integrated communication, navigation, and remote sensing can be built to provide all-day, all-weather, all-region application-oriented services. This system fully utilizes the benefits of satellite applications. Thus, it breaks the barriers of satellites of communication, navigation, and remote sensing. Building a space-based information real-time service system (positioning, navigation, timing, remote sensing, communication, PNTRC) based on "one-satellite multitasking, multi-satellite networking, multi-network integration, and intelligent services" that integrates communication, navigation, and remote sensing, has become an important direction for the development of contemporary aerospace information technology. In the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, it is inevitable to study remote sensing service technologies for real-time applications in the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence is important to meet people's strong demand for "fast, accurate, and flexible" remote sensing information services with the way of B2B, B2G, or B2C. This paper first studied the real-time service capabilities of space-air-ground-sea integrated Earth observation network. Then, the real-time application service requirements of remote sensing technology (requirements for high-efficiency remote sensing services for earthquake and disaster relief, remote sensing monitoring requirements for land surface deformation, and demand for public real-world services) were elaborated. Finally, the on-orbit processing technology based on artificial intelligence was analyzed, and the trend of remote sensing technology transformed from remote sensing information to real-time services was discussed. © 2021, Science Press.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Systems Complexity is driven by more connectivity among constituents and increased environmental uncertainties. Modularity is a system's mechanism to manage complexity in the presence of environmental heterogeneities. Here, a general design decision framework for modularity and fractionation in complex systems is presented. This framework incorporates spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environment, adaptability of the system and costs associated with modularity. It is argued that as the space-time heterogeneity of the environment increases, higher levels of modularity are needed. To determine the optimal level of modularity, a four-level modularity pyramid is introduced. This pyramid takes into account functional and physical dimensions of modularity and allows for resource sharing to enables dynamic modularity. Moving up from each level is quantified by an M+ operation that calculates the net value of increased modularity for each sub-system. In the end, a detailed case for F6 Satellite systems is presented, quantified and simulated. © 2012 by Babak Heydari and Kia Dalili.

TI  - Quartic Riemannian Trust Region Algorithm For Cognitive Radar Ambiguity Function Shaping
JO  - IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters
PY  - 2022
AB  - Waveform adaptation grants cognitive radar (CR) the ability to adapt to its environment, which requires an effective framework to synthesize waveforms sharing a desired ambiguity function (AF). In this letter, we propose a novel method for shaping the slow-time AF in order to adaptively suppress the interference power. The problem is formulated as minimizing the average value of the slow-time AF over some range Doppler bins spanned by the interference, which can be identified exploiting a plurality of knowledge sources. From a technical point of view, this is tantamount to optimizing a complex quartic-order polynomial with a constant modulus (CM) constraint on each optimization variable. To solve this problem, we proposed a quartic Riemannian trust region algorithm. This algorithm first transforms the optimization into an unconstrained one in a complex circle Riemannian manifold, then devises a new Riemannian trust region optimization algorithm that invokes Riemannian gradient and Hessian matrix to obtain an iterative solution with super-linear convergence rate and ability to escape potential saddle points. Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the art approaches for AF shaping while being computationally less expensive. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Optical Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification Based On Multi-Level Cross-Layer Bilinear Fusion
JO  - Guangzi Xuebao/Acta Photonica Sinica
PY  - 2022
AB  - Remote sensing, a kind of detection technology, provides non-contact surface observation through sensor platform. With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle, remote sensing and satellites technology, quantitative remote sensing images with higher resolution can be generated. Compared with medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, these high-resolution remote sensing images contain richer ground objects and spatial details, which can express the spatial structure and texture features of ground object more clearly, providing good conditions and foundation for remote sensing image interpretation and analysis. Therefore, high-resolution remote sensing images have become an important data source for fine earth observation. The scene classification of high-resolution remote sensing image refers to the analysis of extracted remote sensing image information, dividing the scene image of interest to different categories, such as forest, river, railway, etc., and is widely applied in environmental monitoring, urban planning, military object detection, global climate change research and other fields. Unlike general natural images, the geometry structure and space pattern of remote sensing images are highly complex, and there are also problems such as complex background and many types, which is a great challenge for effectively describing remote sensing image content. In addition, as a result of the complexity and diversity of remote sensing image scenes, different scenes may contain almost the same ground object targets, or the same scene may contain different ground object targets. At this regard, how to design discriminative feature representation to describe the image directly affects the quality of scene classification. In the past few decades, many approaches have been proposed, and most of these methods can be divided into two main categories. The traditional scene classification methods, such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Color Histogram (CH), mainly use hand-crafted feature but highly depend on the priori knowledge of the designer, resulting in the features with low-level semantics and limited representational capacity. By contrast, convolutional neural network has been successfully applied in remote sensing scene classification as its excellent feature self-learning ability. It can learn features directly from data without the need of priori knowledge of the designer. However, the accuracy of the scene classification approach based on CNN largely depends on the network structure and due to the complex spatial patterns, large inter-class similarity and high intra-class diversity of remote sensing scene images, the scene classification accuracy is severely limited. To address above issues, a novel remote sensing image scene classification algorithm via multilevel cross-layer bilinear fusion is proposed. Firstly, ResNet50 avoids the issues of model overfitting and gradient vanishing. It is employed to extract the remote sensing image multi-level features. In this way, the four multi-scale multi-level features of conv2_x, conv3_x, conv4_x and conv5_x layers were extracted by ResNet50 model. The dilated convolution with different expansion rates can perceive scene information at multiple spatial scales, promoting the network to acquire features at different scales. The context features at multiple spatial scales are extracted by setting the expansion rate of dilated convolution to different values. Then, the scene semantics of the feature information is enriched by serial fusion of multi-scale features. Since features at different levels contain different types of information, the high-level features provide global semantic information, which is helpful to identify and locate objects in the image. On the contrary, the low-level features contain rich local spatial information to refine and enrich the internal structure of salient objects. Such features can help high-level features to complement their loss of spatial information, which is beneficial f r classification. The global context information of an image has a global receptive field. Considering the global information, the scene category can be inferred and the interference of background details can be filtered. By taking the advantages of low-level, high-level, and global context features, a multilevel attention feature fusion module is presented, which can effectively enhance the feature extraction capability of the model. The spatial attention is designed to focus on the key location of the scene image, which adaptively learn the importance of different image regions, depressing the irrelevant information of background. The global context information is integrated into the feature fusion process of low-level local features and high-level semantics features to realize the complementary feature information of each level, resulting in pleasing scene classification accuracy. Finally, inspired by fine-grained visual classification, a cross-layer bilinear fusion method is utilized to perform layered fusion of multilevel features, and the fused features are used for classification. Hadamard product operation at any two different levels is utilized to extract second-order bilinear information. Based on this cross-layer modeling to capture the association between local features, the hierarchical feature interaction and efficient information integration can be achieved, and the deep semantic information and shallow texture information contained in different hierarchical features are fully aggregated. Moreover, compared with the traditional bilinear pooling method, the Hadamard product is the product of two matrices' corresponding elements, which does not change the dimension of the matrix, effectively solved the dimension explosion caused by the outer product operation. Through extensive experiments conducted on the UCM, AID and PatternNet datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. Compared with other advanced approaches, the proposed method achieves more excellent classification performance.

TI  - For Clean And Safe Space Environment - Three Dimensional Standard Routing Problem
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH SOCIETY OF JAPAN
PY  - 2002
AB  - We have launched the first artificial satellite in 1957. Since then, a new environmental problem has been brought about by ourselves. That is the space pollution. Everything we have lifted up can become space debris when we lose control of it. The space debris is accumulated around the outer atmosphere more than forty years and is propagating by collision and explosion of itself. As the debris has high kinetic energy, the space pollution affects the safety of our future space activities. For the sake of reducing the debris and preserving clear and safe space environment, we have been developing spacecraft of various types, such as for observation, for sweeping the debris up, or for shooting them down. Even if we may take any one of these responses to the debris, a concrete operating plan of spacecraft has not declared till now. In this paper, we propose one of the efficient operating plans of the spacecraft. If a spacecraft flies along the route constructed by our proposing procedure, it will be able to respond more efficient to individual drifting debris. When we construct the 3-dimensional standard route of the spacecraft, we extend the routing methods in 2-dimension that was applied to make standard routes of an aircraft in surveillance operation at sea. In these methods, the standard routes (piecewise linear) are constructed under the policy of maximizing the expected value of the detected ships locally within an operation. That objective value is calculated as integration, along a given route, of product value of the detecting probability from the plane and the density of the ships in the area. In this 3-dimensional extended case, we also use non-linear optimization technique (quasi-Newton method) to make the spacecraft routes. By numerical experiments, we can construct 3-dimensional standard routes that close to drifting debris.

TI  - Probabilistic Seasonal Dengue Forecasting In Vietnam: A Modelling Study Using Superensembles
JO  - PLoS Medicine
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002–2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score [CRPS] = 66.8, 95% CI 60.6–148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95% CI 78.5–80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69%) than that of the baseline model (54.5%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95% CI 102–575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95% CI 120–168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems. © 2021 Colón-González et al.

AB  - The Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) has been receiving satellite data for 25 years. A new system for the reception of high resolution digital data from METEOSTAT and NOAA was installed in 1988. After a description of the present global meteorological satellite system and the planning for future systems, information is given on the utilization of satellite data: METEOSAT images are used for weather monitoring and very short range forecasts. In two examples the capability of the imagery is demonstrated to monitor the weather activity of atmospheric fronts and the development of cyclonic storms. Another section deals with the usage of quantitative data such as seasurface temperatures or atmospheric vertical temperature profiles in numerical weather forecasting. Satellite data are used even in climatological. agricultural-meteorological and environmental studies. Satellite data have become an indispensable tool for the legal tasks of meteorological services. Furthermore they have an enormous benefit even for other sciences than operational meteorology. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Indian space programme, whose objectives involve acceleration of economic and social development through applications of space technology, has been engaged in the development of state-of-the-art satellite systems, launch vehicles and equipment necessary for applications. Even during the early phase of evolution of this Programme, deliberate policies have been adopted by the national space agency, namely, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), to promote spin-off benefit from the technologies developed for the use of space projects. Consistently adhering to this policy, ISRO has transferred over 280 technologies till date, spanning a wide spectrum of disciplines. This has resulted in a fruitful two-way cooperation between a number of SMEs and the ISRO. In order to make the technology transfer process effective. ISRO has adopted a variety of functional and organizational policies that included awareness building measures, licensee selection methods, innovative contract systems, diverse transfer processes, post licencing services and feedback mechanisms. Besides analyzing these policies and their evolution, the paper discusses various models adopted for technology transfer and their impact on assessment. It also touches upon relevant issues relating to creating interface between public funded R\&D and the private commercial enterprises. It suggests few models in which international cooperation could be pursued in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Progress Of Setting Up Geoss After November 2010 - The Necessity To Secure Adherence To Its Data Sharing Guidelines
JO  - 62nd International Astronautical Congress 2011, IAC 2011
PY  - 2011
AB  - Adoption of the GEOSS Data Sharing Implementation Guidelines and of the Action Plan is crucial for the success of GEOSS and improved access to global Earth observation data and resources. Free and unrestricted access to and use of data and information integrated in GEOSS by all actors involved in GEOSS and its users is essential for the development and operation of the system of systems. The paper aims to suggest the strategy of advocating in favour of the open access to data within GEOSS by establishing the strongest link possible with GEOSS activities and the common good that stipulates sharing in societies. The link is formulated on the basis provided by the theories of the common good that were developed by various philosophers of the past and elaborated by the thinkers of the present. Its essence lies in the emphasis on interdependence of the necessity to share protected assets or to ensure access to them and the value of the activity that involves utilisation of such resources for the society on the whole. The society has the interest in secured access to Earth observation data because access to them makes people information-rich, and their use contributes to sustainable development. These common goods substantiate the primary argument that this paper identifies as calling for the recognition of the principle of sharing as part of the legal regime governing Earth observation activities and the relationship of GEOSS with its participants. The plea to nation states, agencies and other involved organisations to open up access to Earth observation data, particularly for the purposes of the successful operations of GEOSS, can reach its aim if it is focused on the realisation and acceptance of the necessity to make decisions that accommodate interests not only of the actual or potential owners of information, but also of its users. This is particularly true because Earth observation data and information have little value without use, and the benefits of their use cannot be achieved without data sharing.

JO  - International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure: Transferring Research into Practice, SHMII
PY  - 2021
AB  - An uprising use of LiDAR in bridge engineering is focused on condition assessment. Researchers are focused on investigating how the use of diverse remote sensing technologies individually and collectively can enhance the data gathered throughout the transportation infrastructure, tackling surface damage detection and quantification, crack detection, and estimation of corrosion areas on structural members. This research aims to evaluate the ability of LiDAR to contribute to improved bridge assessment and management, through the performance of LiDAR scanning during and after the construction of a bridge deck to: (a) evaluate the ability of providing real-time verification of design specifications, and (b) to capture detailed surface deck profile information that allows examining correlations to non-destructive evaluations (NDE) technologies results (Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Half Cell Potential (HCP)). After analyzing the results obtained through LiDAR, it can be concluded that the bridge deck profile can be captured and defined within an accuracy of ± 2 mm on a 10 to 25 m range. Additionally, if the profile of the top and bottom of the deck are able to be captured before and after construction it is possible to estimate the top rebar cover that can be used to predict possible initial deterioration locations. Moreover, when comparing the estimated deck profile and geometry with the NDE data, it was possible to determine that areas where the slope was between -0.5% and 0.5% presented higher values for potential corrosion, and areas where the top rebar cover was below 1.5 in. presented a higher vulnerability for corrosion. Finally, it is recommended to perform LiDAR scanning during and after construction inspections of bridge decks to add valuable information to the Long-Term Bridge Performance suite of NDE technologies. © 2021 International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure: Transferring Research into Practice, SHMII.

TI  - Human Ecology Of Climate Change Hazards: Concepts, Literature Review, And Methodology
PY  - 2019
AB  - This introductory chapter provides the context and the scope of this book. It is structured in two main sections. At first the motivation adapting an inter- to transdisciplinary, human ecological approach for the complex natural disaster problems is addressed. Among others, the consequences of this option are both a wide range of methods and the unavoidable uncertainty. The section on the human ecology of climate change hazards provides the conceptual model of the book: it combines the biophysical aspects with those of the human environment. A selection of the main effects of climate changes in Vietnam provides information on temperature trends that significantly varies over this long country. Next to temperature, also the variations in rain patterns and natural climates are introduced. Special attention is given to the coastal and mountainous study areas of this book. Part two describes the methods used in the subsequent seven chapters. Of notice, a particular method may be used in different chapters. On the one hand, biophysical methods as remote sensing and GIS are described, with special reference to coastal erosion studies. On the other hand, methods which dovetail in the social sciences are discussed. They include the analysis of networks between stakeholders and monetary valuation studies. The human ecological way of thinking provides however particular attention to methods allowing the integration between biophysical and socioeconomic data. At this level, questionnaires, (variants of) Delphi studies, a combination of indicators and indexes, multi-criteria analysis, and spatial modeling are used. The chapter is concluded by two tables indicating which methods are used in the seven remaining chapters of the book.

TI  - Measuring The U.s. Outdoor Recreation Economy, 2012-2016
JO  - JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper summarizes the methodology and results of newly-released federal statistics describing the U.S. outdoor recreation economy. These new statistics show that outdoor recreation represented 2.2\% of the U.S. economy from 2012 to 2016, similar in size to the utilities and mining industries. Boating/fishing contributed \$38.2 billion to gross output in 2016, followed by game areas (includes golfing and tennis) (\$36.3 billion) and RVing (\$30.8 billion). Additionally, more than 4.5 million jobs were generated by the outdoor recreation economy in 2016, resulting in \$213.6 billion of compensation paid to U.S. workers. These new statistics provide for the first time a comprehensive and consistent measure of the value of outdoor recreation to the U.S. economy. Any future updates to these statistics may consider adding regional data and a longer time series to provide even more meaningful statistics to researchers and policymakers. Management implications: New statistics provide estimates of the outdoor recreation economy from an unbiased source: the outdoor recreation satellite account (ORSA). The ORSA provides a solid framework to measure the outdoor economy and can be used -To show the significance of the outdoor recreation economy -To compare its relevance with other economic sectors -To examine the growth of the outdoor recreation economy over time in a detailed manner -To pay attention to specific outdoor recreation activities and their respective changes over time.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Pollution is one of the leading risk factors for the deterioration of the environment, mankind's poor health, and endangerment of the plant kingdom. The exploration of water pollution levels through a new remote sensing model “Water Pollution Index” makes this study unique, which is derived from the weighted overlay technique using land surface temperature, Chlorophyll Index, NCAI, and backscattering values from Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, and Landsat 8 data sets. This chapter is concerned with the qualitative study of water pollution of the Yamuna river stretch, Delhi. To substantiate the results, sources are taken from different published papers and ground surveys. The objective is to define the pollution level and its contributing factors, algae blooming, sewage debris, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shutdown impact, and rain in different seasons for two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. A noticeable difference is found in the annual result indicating less pollution in 2020 especially in premonsoon data compared to 2019. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Method For The Estimation Of Finely-Grained Temporal Spatial Human Population Density Distributions Based On Cell Phone Call Detail Records
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Estimating and mapping population distributions dynamically at a city-wide spatial scale, including those covering suburban areas, has profound, practical, applications such as urban and transportation planning, public safety warning, disaster impact assessment and epidemiological modelling, which benefits governments, merchants and citizens. More recently, call detail record (CDR) of mobile phone data has been used to estimate human population distributions. However, there is a key challenge that the accuracy of such a method is difficult to validate because there is no ground truth data for the dynamic population density distribution in time scales such as hourly. In this study, we present a simple and accurate method to generate more finely grained temporal-spatial population density distributions based upon CDR data. We designed an experiment to test our method based upon the use of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). In this experiment, the highest spatial resolution of every grid cell is 125x125 square metre, while the temporal resolution can vary from minutes to hours with varying accuracy. To demonstrate our method, we present an application of how to map the estimated population density distribution dynamically for CDR big data from Beijing, choosing a half hour as the temporal resolution. Finally, in order to cross-check previous studies that claim the population distribution at nighttime (from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. on the next day) mapped by Beijing census data are similar to the ground truth data, we estimated the baseline distribution, first, based upon records in CDRs. Second, we estimate a baseline distribution based upon Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. The results also show the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is about 5000 while the two baseline distributions mentioned above have an RMSE of over 13,500. Our estimation method provides a fast and simple process to map people's actual density distributions at a more finely grained, i.e., hourly, temporal resolution.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Data-driven decision making is the key to providing effective and efficient wildfire protection and sustainable use of natural resources. Due to the complexity of natural systems, management decision(s) require clear justification based on substantial amounts of information that are both accurate and precise at various spatial scales. To build information and incorporate it into decision making, new analytical frameworks are required that incorporate innovative computational, spatial, statistical, and machine-learning concepts with field data and expert knowledge in a manner that is easily digestible by natural resource managers and practitioners. We prototyped such an approach using function modeling and batch processing to describe wildfire risk and the condition and costs associated with implementing multiple prescriptions for risk mitigation in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, USA. Three key aspects of our approach included: (1) spatially quantifying existing fuel conditions using field plots and Sentinel 2 remotely sensed imagery; (2) spatially defining the desired future conditions with regards to fuel objectives; and (3) developing a cost/revenue assessment (CRA). Each of these components resulted in spatially explicit surfaces describing fuels, treatments, wildfire risk, costs of implementation, projected revenues associated with the removal of tree volume and biomass, and associated estimates of model error. From those spatially explicit surfaces, practitioners gain unique insights into tradeoffs among various described prescriptions and can further weigh those tradeoffs against financial and logistical constraints. These types of datasets, procedures, and comparisons provide managers with the information needed to identify, optimize, and justify prescriptions across the landscape. © 2021 by the authors.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective: to analyze the characteristics of children and adolescents treated for external causes in an emergency service. Method: this is a retrospective, analytical study, developed in the emergency department of a sentinel hospital in southern Brazil. Seventy-nine children and adolescents, victims of external causes, participated in June to December 2018. Data were collected through access to medical records in May 2019. Descriptive analysis, frequency comparison and Odds Ratio were used to measure the association between the variables studied. Confidence Interval (CI) of 95% and P value of 5% were used. Results: approximately 9.3% of pediatric emergency and emergency care were due to external causes; of these, 57% of the victims are under 12 years old and most of them are male (67%). Accidents are the most frequent events (71%), but violence is more frequent (61%) among women (p=0.002). The chance of violence is four times higher in women, especially self-inflicted violence/suicide attempts. Conclusion: one out of ten pediatric emergency care is due to external causes, and emerging situations of violence and self-inflicted injuries stand out, a direct implication for public policies. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

TI  - A Retrieval And Validation Method For Shelterbelt Vegetation Fraction
JO  - Journal of Forestry Research
PY  - 2013
AB  - Shelterbelts are important in defending against natural disaster and maintaining ecological balances in farmland. Understanding of the shelterbelt vegetation fraction is fundamental to regional research of shelterbelts using remote sensing. We used SPOT5 imagery with 10×10m spatial resolution in combination with knowledge of the characteristics of shelterbelts to develop a method for retrieval of the vegetation fraction of shelterbelts by the pixel un-mixing model. We then used the method to retrieve values for shelterbelts in study area. By combining the parameters of photographic images with characteristics of shelterbelts, we developed a method for measuring the vegetation fraction of shelterbelts based on an advanced photographic method. We then measured the actual values to validate the retrieval result. The multiple correlation coefficients between the retrieved and measured values were 0. 715. Our retrieval and measuring methods presented in this paper accurately reflect field conditions. We suggest that this method is useful to describe shelterbelt structure using remote sensing. © 2013 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Bayesian Data Characterization And State Prediction For A Large Eddy Turbulent Flow Simulation: A Revisitation
JO  - International Conference on Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer
PY  - 2021
AB  - Environmental engineering remote sensing platforms using hyperspectral imagery and other multidimensional modalities are often responsible for monitoring coastal regions in order to safeguard national waters. This objective requires determining sub-surface turbulent structure from surface water flow spatial measurements for state assessment and decision-making. The inability of remote sensing platforms to penetrate the water column at depth because of turbulence-induced sediment-concentration modulation necessitates using models that dynamically link surface and sub-surface flow structure. Large eddy simulations (LES) are a useful proxy for the analysis of hyperspectral imagery due to the tri-dimensional structure of both information carrying modalities. Bayesian statistical models are used to revisit the analysis of a large-eddy simulated three-dimensional turbulent shear flow [1]. The purpose is the exploration of the feasibility of creating data characterization and state prediction system models for sub-surface vorticity and stress, and surface root mean square (rms) velocity and rms sediment concentration which could then be utilized in the analysis of environmental hyperspectral imagery. Nine turbulent feature time series were derived from forty-one three dimensional LES data cube realizations taken at distinct times during steady state conditions. Generative topographic mapping (GTM) [2] is a non-linear latent variable mapping which furnishes a two-dimensional organized representation of nonlinear multidimensional data in terms of latent variables. The nine-dimensional turbulent feature data points including vorticity, stress, rms cross-mean flow velocity, and rms sediment concentration were mapped using the GTM providing a clear segmentation of data points in latent space. This segmentation was characterized by a strong demarcation between low rms and high rms value data points. Vorticity time series and rms sediment concentration time series were selected for Gaussian mixture modeling and hidden Markov model parameter estimation to understand their statistical structure. Gaussian mixture modeling [2] results depict a covariance-based relationship between vorticity and rms sediment concentration which has a positive linear trend for low values of both variables, but which exhibits a negative linear trend at high values. Hidden Markov model parameter estimation [3] results substantiate this relationship between the two variables, in particular the nonlinear dynamics where high vorticity levels are associated with decreasing rather than increasing levels of rms sediment concentration. This trend is due to turbulence dampening where sediment concentration increases the effective viscosity of the sediment-laden fluid flow system to such a level that turbulent fluctuations can no longer sustain large sediment particle concentrations. Gaussian process [4] modeling is able to provide semi-linear extrapolations of future vorticity and rms cross-mean flow velocity values over time. A strong negative linear trend prediction, however, is only possible for rms sediment concentration because of not only the limited amount of data but also the limited dynamic range of data values. © 2021, Avestia Publishing.

TI  - Theory And Practice On Database Of Three-Dimensional Vegetation Quantity
JO  - Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica

AB  - The difference in spatial structure of urban greenery affects the environmental quality to a great extent. Taking the ability of absorbing CO2 and producing O2 as an example, the volume the forest produce is about five times as much as that produced by grass of the same size. It can be inferred that the methods of relative analysis often used are not very accurate in some sense. The three-dimentional vegetation quantity (hereinafter referred to as "3-D VQ") is a new concept put forward by the author. The3-D VQ means the volume of a space occupied by stem and leaves of a plant. Compared with those values concerning plane, the greenery value is the index that demonstrates the differences of urban greenery in spatial organization better. Therefore, it can be applied to calculate the theoretical value of environmental benefit in terms of greenery more accurately. After several years' research, a series of theories and techniques have been made out. Several major breakthroughs are described as follows: 1. In terms of the method of simulating the stereo quantity by the plane quantity, the remote sensing models of measuring and calculating the 3-D VQ were put forward. With them we surveyed and calculated the 3-D VQ through interpretation of color infrared aerial photos and simulation technology of computer. Especially the "Logistic curve" equation was successfully corrected; as a result, the precision of calculating the 3-D VQ has remarkably been improved. 2. The first database of 3-D VQ has been established. There are several advances in the studies of the theories and techniques of establishing data model and structure and arranging and coding files and data. 3. The 3-D VQ database has been developed into an advanced management system in the general form of GIS. This system has the functions of inquiry, statistics, amendment, charting and establishment of new 3-D VQ database with the basic characters of spatially locating and window- appearing. The system can directly serve the consumers of garden department as a macro-managemental system for the whole city. It gives a lot of help to make a scientific and automatic management of gardens. It has also provided theoretical and technological basis for some relative analyses between urban greenery and environment for other relative studies.

TI  - Exploring The Impacts Of Urban Expansion On Green Spaces Availability And Delivery Of Ecosystem Services In The Accra Metropolis
JO  - Environmental Challenges
PY  - 2021
AB  - As Accra, Ghana's capital city, expands at an unprecedented rate, the fragmentation and loss of natural and semi-natural ecosystems may be the greatest challenge to achieving sustainable development. This study investigates the impact of Accra's growth and expansion on its natural green spaces, availability, and ecosystem services delivery. The study uses remotely sensed imageries (Landsat 1991–2018) for land use change analysis, the i-Tree Canopy model to quantify and value of urban ecosystems and stakeholder interviews to explore perceptions on green space value. Results showed that the overwhelming number of stakeholders understand and are aware of the beneficial values of urban green spaces but highlight poor planning, coupled with land tenure challenges, as a threat to the conservation of green spaces. Land use and land cover change analysis shows that the urban built environment has expanded from 55.1% to 83.79% at the expense of the natural environment, including green spaces, which have declined from 41% to 15% over 27 years. Existing areas of green spaces, including the Achimota forest, the University of Ghana campus and street trees on major roads, were valued at US$37,610,980 for carbon sequestration and storage, US$1,478,173 for air pollution regulation and US$458 for avoided runoff. A rapid assessment of the availability, accessibility and management of urban green spaces in the Accra metropolis can be an essential step towards identifying and mapping their consumptive and non-consumptive use-value and introducing appropriate interventions necessary for enhancing the city's resilience in an era of climate change. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Combining Geostatistical Models And Remotely Sensed Data To Improve Tropical Tree Richness Mapping
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2011
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution and composition of biological communities is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Reliable maps of species richness across the landscape can be useful tools for these purposes. Acquiring such information through traditional survey techniques is costly and logistically difficult. The kriging interpolation method has been widely used as an alternative to predict spatial distributions of species richness, as long as the data are spatially dependent. However, even when this requirement is met, researchers often have few sampled sites in relation to the area to be mapped. Remote sensing provides an inexpensive means to derive complete spatial coverage for large areas and can be extremely useful for estimating biodiversity. The aim of this study was to combine remotely sensed data with kriging estimates (hybrid procedures) to evaluate the possibility of improving the accuracy of tree species richness maps. We did this through the comparison of the predictive performance of three hybrid geostatistical procedures, based on tree species density recorded in 141 sampling quadrats: co-kriging (COK), kriging with external drift (KED), and regression kriging (RK). Reflectance values of spectral bands, computed NDVI and texture measurements of Landsat 7 TM imagery were used as ancillary variables in all methods. The R-2 values of the models increased from 0.35 for ordinary kriging to 0.41 for COK, and from 0.39 for simple regression estimates to 0.52 and 0.53 when using simple KED and RK, respectively. The R-2 values of the models also increased from 0.60 for multiple regression estimates to 0.62 and 0.66 when using multiple KED and RK, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrate that these procedures are capable of greatly improving estimation accuracy, with multivariate RK being clearly superior, because it produces the most accurate predictions, and because of its flexibility in modeling multivariate relationships between tree richness and remotely sensed data. We conclude that this is a valuable tool for guiding future efforts aimed at conservation and management of highly diverse tropical forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Cross Comparison Framework For The Accuracies Of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture Products In A Climate-Sensitive Grassland Region
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological processes and is included in a wide range of global datasets; however, accurate indications of spatio-temporal characteristics of soil moisture remain limited for East Asia. This study focused on Hulunbeir, a typical climate-sensitive grassland area in East Asia. Four soil moisture datasets were retrieved from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), CMA Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and the differences between these datasets and measured soil moisture data were analyzed by correlation analysis. The key factors affecting soil water, such as slope, precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were selected to identify the main causes of errors between the product dataset values and measured data by multiple stepwise regression analysis. The four products tended to underestimate the soil moisture but exaggerated the temporal variation in winter and spring. The CLDAS and SMAP products provided good representation of the amplitude and spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture. The GLDAS product performed well with acceptable error metrics but failed to capture the vertical variation in soil moisture. The SMOS product had a missing data problem, which reduced its utility in the study area. Notably, NDVI and precipitation were the main factors leading to the underestimation by the above four products. This study provides an important reference for accurately describing the hydrological characteristics of climate-sensitive grassland areas to achieve efficient management of water resources.

TI  - Data Assimilation For Leaf Area Index Of Tobacco On The Basis Of The Ensemble Kalman Filter In Nanxiong
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2017
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) can be used as a monitoring index for assessing tobacco health in different growing periods. Hence, acquiring and updating accurate LAI data in a timely manner are necessary for managing the growth of tobacco. Growth information for tobacco in different seasons could provide valuable information for management on a national scale. Accurate and continuous tobacco LAI dynamics data are based on the data fusion framework of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which is an efficient recursive filter to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noise measurements, can be used to obtain optimal results. Nanxiong City in Guangdong Province was selected as the study area to extract LAI data for tobacco and test the effect of EnKF method on the basis of quantitative remote sensing data for the growing state of tobacco in 2014. Tobacco canopy hyperspectral reflectance data in different growing seasons were collected every 15 days by using AvaSpec-ULS2048 HandHeld spectroradiometer made by Avantes company in the Netherlands. Tobacco LAI data were retrieved using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which was calculated using the reflectance data. An improved tobacco growth model (LOGISTIC) was established using the LAI data collected around Nanxiong. This improved model used LAI and accumulated temperature to reveal the changes in LAI in different growing seasons. On the basis of integration of LAI data (obtained using remote sensing data) and LAI data (obtained using the simplified LOGISTIC model and EnKF method), continuous LAI data were obtained in the time series during the tobacco growing season in Nanxiong. Finally, we compared three different LAI computing methods in tobacco study: (a) calculated by NDVI, (b) simulated by the LOGISTIC model and (c) data assimilation was based on EnKF. The results indicated that these three methods could describe the growth status of tobacco to a certain extent, especially in the mature growth period, however, the LAI assimilation method was the best, which was able to adjust measured values and model values dynamically, LAI data were more consistent with the practical growth conditions of tobacco. Method (a) was imperfect at early and late growth seasons of tobacco (in these two seasons, the LAI data were either less or more), and method (b) was more dependent on accumulated temperature data (LOGISTIC model could not effectively describe the unexpected changes in tobacco LAI). The results showed that the EnKF algorithm could obtain better estimation on the basis of the dynamic model, and assimilate remote sensing data into the dynamic model to obtain optimal estimation for LAI. The assimilated LAI data were closer to the real values, and the LAI curve was more consistent with actual tobacco growth status. © 2017, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remotely Sensing Arthropod And Nutrient Stressed Plants: A Case Study With Nitrogen And Cotton Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
JO  - Environmental Entomology
PY  - 2010
AB  - Remote sensing can be used in combination with ground sampling to detect aphid(Aphis gossypii Glover) infested cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Changes in wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) have proven useful for such detection, but these changes can be confused with other factors stressing plants, such as water deficiency and nutrient status. This study was designed to test the utility of this technology to distinguish between two factors stressing plants: nitrogen deficiency and aphids. Field plots were created by applying varying rates of nitrogen to cotton at different dates in the growing season in 2003 and 2004. Subplots were created by applying disruptive insecticides, which increased aphid populations in a portion of the subplots. Airplane and satellite remote sensing data in 2003 and 2004 were supplemented with ground sampling of aphid populations in both years. Insecticide application, nitrogen application rate and date influenced aphid abundance. Cotton with higher aphid populations could be distinguished from cotton with natural aphid infestations independent of plant nitrogen status using a NIR wavelength in 2003 and a proprietary 2004 index. Complex distinctions among varying nitrogen treatments and aphid abundance were not possible using this data. In the future, possible confounding factors should be investigated from the perspective of their change on crop physiology before remote sensing can be used in an integrated pest management (IPM) program. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Identifying And Understanding Alternative States Of Dryland Landscape: A Hierarchical Analysis Of Time Series Of Fractional Vegetation-Soil Nexuses In China's Hexi Corridor
JO  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding and early identification of state transitions in dryland systems' landscape pattern are challenging but critical for conservation planning and sustainable management strategies. Currently the alternative states of drylands have been identified based on dynamics of single vegetation index (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index), with the interactions between vegetation and soil components often being neglected. Here, we proposed a framework for identifying the alternative states in relation to land degradation based on the interactive pathways of fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember nexuses. In this framework, we initially generated 16-day fractional green vegetation endmember (green vegetation {[}GV]) and soil-related endmembers (sand {[}SL], saline {[}SA], dark surface {[}DA]) time series using a standardized linear spectral mixture analysis model in the Hexi Corridor during 2001-2017. A discrete wavelet transform based trends and turning points detection (DWT-TTD) algorithm was proposed to detect trends, turning point types, and timing of these time series records. These metrics were subsequently used to identify eight state transition pathways for each endmember and synthetic degradation processes at the appropriate 5-10 year scale. We found that the unmixed fractional endmembers exhibited a consistent agreement with both field abundance values and estimated fractions from high-spatial-resolution Google Earth images. Based on the DWT-TTD algorithm derived alternative pathways, we found that four positive pathways of GV and DA fractions can be observed in the vegetated areas were integrated with corresponding negative pathways of SA and SL fractions. These pathways resulted in remarkably increasing GV (+4551.81 km2) and DA (+9749.26 km2) and significantly declining SA (-1452.70 km2) and SL (-9555.57 km2) from 2001 to 2017. These processes were linked to increased precipitation and temperature and reduced drought degree. Also, the timing of the turning points (around 2007 and 2013) was largely coincidental with the timing of ecological management, suggesting that ecological governance played a crucial role in the state shifts. However, because of drought trends in the barren regions, land desertification exhibited an increasing occurrence in extent (+2.5\% of total pixels) during the study period, which may increase in the future, as indicated by the large pixel proportion of initially positive reversal pathway for SL (9.31\%). Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the DWT-TTD algorithm, as a multi-resolution analysis method, has the potential to detect hierarchical temporal changes and disentangle the cross-scale inherent shifts of vegetation-soil systems. The framework can help devise sustainable management practices that maintain land degradation neutrality, especially when integrated with land use cover change analysis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of Vegetation Net Primary Productivity And Its Relationships With Climatic Factors In Hunan Province
JO  - Chinese Journal of Ecology
PY  - 2022
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator for evaluating the responses of ecosystems to climate change and anthropogenic activities. The monthly NPP datasets (250 m resolution) of Hunan Province from 2000 to 2019 were generated through combining the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and a series of spatial datasets such as the MODIS monthly vegetation index product, TerraClimate datasets, and land-cover map (i.e., ChinaCover2010). The NPP trend and its relationships with climatic factors at the watershed scale were investigated using the Mann-Kendall test and multiple regression model. The results showed that annual mean NPP of Hunan Province was 566.92 g C·m-2 ·a-1 between 2000 and 2019. The headwater of Xiangjiang River basin had the highest value of annual mean NPP of 625.28 g C·m-2·a-1, while the Dongting Lake basin had the lowest NPP value of 492.11 g C·m-2·a-1. The annual NPP fluctuations of the five watersheds were generally similar, with an increasing trend before 2008 and then a shortly but dramatically decreasing trend in 2009 with slowly NPP recovery since 2010. About 38% area exhibited a monotonic increasing trend and about 10% area a monotonic decreasing trend, which was mainly distributed in the Dongting Lake basin and the “Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan” urban agglomeration, respectively. The relative importance of the meteorological factors varied among the five watersheds, with an overall ranking of vapor pressure (0.331), temperature (0.318), solar radiation (0.299), and precipitation (0.062). The correlation between precipitation and NPP was not statistically significant. Our results demonstrated that extreme climate events (e.g., snow disasters, floods) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., land development, returning cropland to the lake) decreased vegetation NPP of Hunan Province. It is necessary to distinguish the differences in the ecological effects of such NPP changes when managing ecosystems in practice. © 2022 editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.
