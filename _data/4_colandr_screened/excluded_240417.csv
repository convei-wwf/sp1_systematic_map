6661281,NA,"An Analysis Of The Spatial And Temporal Changes In Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Service Functions","Since Westman (1977) and Ehrlich (1982) put forward the concepts of ""the service of nature"" and ""ecosystem service functions"", respectively, methods for conducting value accounting for them, and their practical application have become the subjects of intense study. Based on an overview of available research findings, we discuss three scientific hypotheses. First, the terrestrial ecosystem offers both positive and negative service functions. Second, changes in terrestrial ecosystem service functions lie not only in the number of ecosystem types and the coverage area of each type, but also in their quality. Third, the value of terrestrial ecosystem service functions should be assessed both in terms of the value stocked and the value added. We collected land use data from China during the period 1999-2008, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data based on remote sensing images from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies for the same period. We then calculated and analyzed spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service values over the 10-year period. Considering temporal change, the total value (stocked) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions decreased from 6.82 trillion Yuan RMB in 1999 to 6.57 trillion Yuan RMB in 2008. During that period, the positive value decreased by 240.17 billion Yuan RMB and the negative value increased by 8.85 billion Yuan RMB. The decrease in total value lies mainly in the humidity control, soil formation, and waste recycling functions. The total value (added) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions increased by 4.31 billion Yuan RMB in 2000, but decreased by 0.13 billion Yuan RMB in 2008 (based on the constant price of China in 1999). The value (added) was a negative figure. From the perspective of spatial change, we can see that the supply of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions fell slightly over the past 10 years, mainly in Northeast and Southern China. As a result of human activities on ecosystems, the loss of ecosystem service functions' value was relatively prominent in Shanxi and Gansu provinces, compared with an increase in value in Shaanxi Province. Terrestrial ecosystem service functions' value per unit area was relatively high in mid- and East China, showing a prominent spatial change over the 10-year period, but low in Western China. Some conclusions are drawn after an in-depth analysis of the factors causing the spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions, in the hope that our suggestions will be helpful for the management of China's terrestrial ecosystems.",2012,"{""Huang JinLou"",""Shi Yao"",""Wang RuSong"",""Yang WenRui""}","{""China's terrestrial ecosystems; ecosystem service functions; positive"",""negative value accounting; analysis of spatial"",""temporal change""}","ARTICLE",NA,"10.1007/s11434-012-4978-5","{}","{cco}",2024-04-11 22:10:51,32501,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}"
6447813,NA,"Virtual globes and geospatial health: the potential of new tools in the management and control of vector-borne diseases","The rapidly growing field of three-dimensional software modeling of the Earth holds promise for applications in the geospatial health sciences. Easy-to-use, intuitive virtual globe technologies such as Google Earth™ enable scientists around the world to share their data and research results in a visually attractive and readily understandable fashion without the need for highly sophisticated geographical information systems (GIS) or much technical assistance. This paper discusses the utility of the rapid and simultaneous visualization of how the agents of parasitic diseases are distributed, as well as that of their vectors and/or intermediate hosts together with other spatially-explicit information. The resulting better understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and the multidimensional environment in which they occur, are highlighted. In particular, the value of Google Earth™, and its web-based pendant Google Maps™, are reviewed from a public health view point, combining results from literature searches and experiences gained thus far from a multidisciplinary project aimed at optimizing schistosomiasis control and transmission surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the basic analytical capabilities of virtual globe applications are limited, we conclude that they have considerable potential in the support and promotion of the geospatial health sciences as a userfriendly, straightforward GIS tool for the improvement of data collation, visualization and exploration.

6447817,NA,"Quantifying flood mitigation services: The economic value of Otter Creek wetlands and floodplains to Middlebury, VT","Functioning ecosystems can buffer communities from many negative impacts of a changing climate. Flooding, in particular, is one of the most damaging natural disasters globally and is projected to increase in many regions. However, estimating the value of “green infrastructure” in mitigating downstream floods remains a challenge. We estimate the economic value of flood mitigation by the Otter Creek floodplains and wetlands to Middlebury, VT, for Tropical Storm Irene and nine other floods. We used first principles to simulate hydrographs for scenarios with and without flood mitigation by upstream wetlands and floodplains. We then mapped flood extents for each scenario and calculated monetary damages to inundated structures. Our analysis indicates damage reductions of 84–95% for Tropical Storm Irene and 54–78% averaged across all 10 events. We estimate that the annual value of flood mitigation services provided to Middlebury, VT, exceeds $126,000 and may be as high as $450,000. Economic impacts of this magnitude stress the importance of floodplain and wetland conservation, warrant the consideration of ecosystem services in land use decisions, and make a compelling case for the role of green infrastructure in building resilience to climate change.",2016,"{""Galford, Gillian"",""O'Niel-Dunne, Jarlath"",""Polasky, Stephen"",""Ricketts, Taylor"",""Watson, Keri B.""}","{""Climate resilience"",""Economic valuation"",""Ecosystem services"",""Flood mitigation"",""Green infrastructure""}","journal","Ecological Economics","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.05.015","{""url"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180091630595X"", ""date"": ""2016-10-01"", ""pages"": ""16"", ""end_page"": ""24"", ""access_date"": ""2023-10-05 19:01:23"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180091630595X/pdfft?md5=fe9f3ed3f747dcc1eaf9aa1742eb3f1c&pid=1-s2.0-S092180091630595X-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y"", ""short_title"": ""Quantifying flood mitigation services"", ""link_to_fulltext"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180091630595X"", ""database_provider"": ""ScienceDirect"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""Ecological Economics""}","{}",NA,NA,NA,NA
6447827,NA,"Floodnet: a telenetwork for acquisition, processing and dissemination of earth observation data for monitoring and emergency management of floods","The aim of FLOODNET is to provide a communications and data distribution facility specifically designed to meet the demanding temporal requirements of flood monitoring within the European Union (EU). Currently, remotely sensed data are not fully utilized for flood applications because potential users are not familiar with the procedure for acquiring the data and do not have a defined route for obtaining help in processing and interpreting the data. FLOODNET will identify the potential user groups within the EU and will, by demonstration, education and the use of telematics, increase the awareness of users to the capabilities of earth observation (EO) and the means by which they can acquire EO data. FLOODNET will act as a filter between users and satellite operation planners to help assign priorities for data acquisition against previously agreed criteria. The network will encourage a user community and will facilitate cross-sector information transfer, particularly between ‘flood experts’ and administrative decision makers. The requirement for two levels of flood mapping is identified: (1) a rapid, ‘broad-brush’ approach to assess the general flood situation and identify areas at greatest risk and in need of immediate assistance; (2) a detailed mapping approach, less critical in time, suitable for input to hydrological models or for flood risk evaluation.

6447820,NA,"Conserving ecosystem services and biodiversity: Measuring the tradeoffs involved in splitting conservation budgets","Conservation organizations increasingly target ecosystem services alongside biodiversity, yet it remains unclear whether ecosystem service goals reinforce or detract from those for biodiversity. We assess tradeoffs between biodiversity and ecosystem services and test the hypothesis that the severity of this tradeoff is a function the breadth of taxa and ecosystem services targeted. We identify optimal conserved lands networks for four taxa, four ecosystem services, and all possible combinations of each. We then assess the amount of biodiversity and ecosystem service contained within each network, its conservation cost, and its overlap with every other network. We find that overlap varies widely across individual ecosystem services and taxa, and that networks targeting multiple services contain more biodiversity than networks targeting a single service. Safeguarding a given amount of ecosystem service and biodiversity through joint optimization requires a 13% increase in conservation budgets relative to achieving targets for biodiversity alone, and results in a 22% budget savings relative to achieving targets for each though separate efforts. We conclude that including ecosystem services goals alongside those for biodiversity is likely have a net positive impact on biodiversity, especially when a broad suite of services are targeted.",2020,"{""Galford, Gillian L."",""Ricketts, Taylor H."",""Sonter, Laura J."",""Watson, Keri B.""}","{Biodiversity,""Conservation planning"",""Ecosystem services""}","journal","Ecosystem Services","10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101063","{""url"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221204162030005X"", ""date"": ""2020-04-01"", ""pages"": ""101063"", ""access_date"": ""2023-10-05 19:01:06"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221204162030005X/pdfft?md5=dce49ea5b6a231c2fa727170bbfc191c&pid=1-s2.0-S221204162030005X-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y"", ""short_title"": ""Conserving ecosystem services and biodiversity"", ""link_to_fulltext"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221204162030005X"", ""database_provider"": ""ScienceDirect"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""Ecosystem Services""}","{}",NA,NA,NA,NA

6447819,NA,"Optimizing wetland restoration to improve water quality at a regional scale","Excessive phosphorus (P) export to aquatic ecosystems can lead to impaired water quality. There is a growing interest among watershed managers in using restored wetlands to retain P from agricultural landscapes and improve water quality. We develop a novel framework for prioritizing wetland restoration at a regional scale. The framework uses an ecosystem service model and an optimization algorithm that maximizes P reduction for given levels of restoration cost. Applying our framework in the Lake Champlain Basin, we find that wetland restoration can reduce P export by 2.6% for a budget of 50 M and 5.1% for a budget of 200 M. Sensitivity analysis shows that using finer spatial resolution data for P sources results in twice the P reduction benefits at a similar cost by capturing hot-spots on the landscape. We identify 890 wetlands that occur in more than 75% of all optimal scenarios and represent priorities for restoration. Most of these wetlands are smaller than 7 ha with contributing area less than 100 ha and are located within 200 m of streams. Our approach provides a simple yet robust tool for targeting restoration efforts at regional scales and is readily adaptable to other restoration strategies.",2019,"{""Gourevitch, Jesse D."",""Polasky, Stephen"",""Ricketts, Taylor H."",""Rizzo, Donna M."",""Singh, Nitin K."",""Watson, Keri B."",""Wemple, Beverley C.""}",NA,"journal","Environmental Research Letters","10.1088/1748-9326/ab1827","{""url"": ""https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab1827"", ""date"": ""2019/05//"", ""pages"": ""064006"", ""access_date"": ""2023-10-05 19:01:13"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab1827/pdf"", ""database_provider"": ""Institute of Physics"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""Environ.

6666308,NA,"Effects Of Land Use Changes On The Ecosystem Service Values Of A Reclamation Farm In Northeast China","Intensive agricultural development can change land use, which can further affect regional ecosystem services and functions. With the rapid growth of the population and the national demand for food, the northeast of China, which is located in the high latitudes, has experienced four agricultural developments since the 1950s. The original wetlands of this area were developed for farmland. The evaluation of ecosystem services is conducted to reveal the ecosystem status and variable trends caused by land reclamation. The aim of this study is to provide scientific basis for environmental management and for the sustainable development of agriculture in Northeast China. With GIS-RS technology, a typical farm was chosen to analyze variations in the ecosystem service value in response to land use changes during the study period. The total ecosystem service value of the farm decreased from 7523.10 million Yuan in 1979 to 4023.59 million Yuan in 2009 with an annual rate of -1.6 % due to the decreasing areas of woodland and wetland. The increased areas of cropland, water area and grassland partly offset the loss of the total value, but the loss was still greater than the compensation. Waste treatment and climate regulation were the top two service functions with high service values, contributing to approximately 50 % of the total service value. The spatial difference of the ecosystem service value also was analyzed. The wetlands located in the central and northeastern sections of the farm changed significantly. From the aspect of ecosystem service value, the wetland and water area should be conserved, as they have the highest value coefficients. The accuracy of the value coefficient, however, needs to be studied further in future research. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2012,"{""Hao, F."",""Lai, X."",""Ouyang, W."",""Song, K."",""Wei, X."",""Xu, Y.""}","{""Agricultural development"",Agriculture,""Annual rates"",China,""Conservation of Natural Resources"",Ecosystem,""Ecosystem service value"",""Ecosystem service values"",""Ecosystem services"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental management"",Farm,Farms,""Geographic Information Systems"",""High Latitudes"",""Land reclamation"",""Land use"",""Land-use change"",Northeast,""Northeast China"",""Population statistics"",""Rapid growth"",""Service functions"",""Spatial differences"",""Total values"",""Waste treatment"",""Water areas"",Wetlands,""accuracy assessment"",""agricultural land"",""alternative agriculture"",""conservation management"",""ecosystem service"",""future prospect""}","journal",NA,"10.1007/s00267-012-9923-5","{}","{cco}",2024-04-11 22:04:33,32501,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}"
6447826,NA,"Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES): A framework for monitoring environmental changes from Earth Observations","Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale. This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.",2017,"{""Alexandris, Nikos"",""Allenbach, Karin"",""Chatenoux, Bruno"",""Dao, Hy"",""De Bono, Andrea"",""De Laborie, Pierric"",""Giuliani, Gregory"",""Peduzzi, Pascal"",""Rodila, Denisa""}","{""Big Data"",""Earth Observations"",""Environmental changes"",Interoperability,Monitoring,""Sustainable development""}","journal","Remote Sensing of Environment","10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.040","{""url"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302481"", ""date"": ""2017-12-01"", ""pages"": ""222"", ""end_page"": ""233"", ""access_date"": ""2023-11-14 22:59:49"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302481/pdfft?md5=3cadc983783556390199689dd3dcbdb1&pid=1-s2.0-S0034425717302481-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y"", ""short_title"": ""Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES)"", ""tertiary_title"": ""Big Remotely Sensed Data: tools, applications and experiences"", ""link_to_fulltext"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302481"", ""database_provider"": ""ScienceDirect"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""Remote Sensing of Environment""}","{}",NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper reviews a number of emerging application areas, drawing on examples from both natural disasters such as earthquakes, and man-made events including recent terrorist attacks. In terms of mitigation and preparedness, remote sensing is making an increasing contribution towards inventory development, hazard and risk assessment and logistical planning. After a disaster has occurred, remote sensing offers a rapid low-risk method of assessing damage to critical infrastructure and the urban built environment. In particular, high resolution coverage enabled the detection of bridge damage following the Northridge earthquake and collapsed buildings following various earthquakes in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Once the initial chaos has subsided, the value of remote sensing data lies in post-event monitoring; tracking changes in hazard location and extent. Reference is made to emergency operations following the World Trade Center attack, where remote sensing imagery supported various response efforts. In terms of secondary applications, details are given concerning innovative new research, using information derived from remote sensing coverage for running traffic rerouting programs, and as a supplementary data source for loss estimation models. © 2006 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

6447818,NA,"Effects of human demand on conservation planning for biodiversity and ecosystem services","Safeguarding ecosystem services and biodiversity is critical to achieving sustainable development. To date, ecosystem services quantification has focused on the biophysical supply of services with less emphasis on human beneficiaries (i.e., demand). Only when both occur do ecosystems benefit people, but demand may shift ecosystem service priorities toward human-dominated landscapes that support less biodiversity. We quantified how accounting for demand affects the efficiency of conservation in capturing both human benefits and biodiversity by comparing conservation priorities identified with and without accounting for demand. We mapped supply and benefit for 3 ecosystem services (flood mitigation, crop pollination, and nature-based recreation) by adapting existing ecosystem service models to include and exclude factors representing human demand. We then identified conservation priorities for each with the conservation planning program Marxan. Particularly for flood mitigation and crop pollination, supply served as a poor proxy for benefit because demand changed the spatial distribution of ecosystem service provision. Including demand when jointly targeting biodiversity and ecosystem service increased the efficiency of conservation efforts targeting ecosystem services without reducing biodiversity outcomes.

6447824,NA,"A new normative economics for the formation of shared social values","There is mounting evidence that a new set of principles is required to form and express, rather than capture, social values for sustainability. This is because many policy questions are sufficiently complex that individual people do not—possible cannot—hold fully pre-formed values with respect to them. Thus, when people are faced with such issues, a process is required to enable them collectively to form and express a bespoke set of values that are shared. This process of shared social value formation can be understood as normative, to the extent that those involved participate in a process of ascribing values to others. This invites us to reconsider the role of normative economics, because it implies that both procedural and distributive justice is unlikely to be achieved through conventional economic logic and processes. The paper argues that the theoretical traditions that have juxtaposed positive and normative economics have been lost, such that rational choice has been progressively limited to the maximisation of economic surplus. This may be acceptable for some policy areas where the state and the individual dominate. However, the formation of social values for sustainability demands a composite approach that enables individuals to work together to form values with respect to issues about which they may have little immediate reference. The paper identifies five principles for establishing normative shared social values, relating to social units of analysis, procedural and distributive justice, dialectical decision-making and the development of social value transfer as a means of relating the shared social values formed and expressed in one context with those appropriate for a related context. The paper concludes with an agenda for research that can test, develop and refine the five principles for normative deliberated social values for sustainability.",2019,"{""Ravenscroft, Neil""}","{Deliberation,""Distributive justice"",""Normative economics"",""Shared social values"",""Social value transfer""}","journal","Sustainability Science","10.1007/s11625-018-0652-4","{""url"": ""https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0652-4"", ""date"": ""2019-09-01"", ""pages"": ""1297"", ""end_page"": ""1307"", ""access_date"": ""2023-11-14 23:04:36"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11625-018-0652-4.pdf"", ""database_provider"": ""Springer Link"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""Sustain Sci""}","{}",NA,NA,NA,NA
6447811,NA,"Opportunities for Increasing the Impact of NASA’s Earth Observations along Environmental Justice Dimensions","Environmental justice (EJ) is an important social priority and has become a policy goal at the federal level. Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, requires all federal agencies to develop programs, policies, and activities to address the disproportionately high adverse environmental impacts faced by marginalized communities. This raises the question of how NASA can increase the impact of its scientific outputs along EJ dimensions. How can the agency’s existing data products be leveraged to enable progress on EJ-related questions? What new scientific information can NASA produce to help reduce environmental inequities? Many of NASA’s earth observations (EOs) offer complete geographic coverage and thus have strong potential to help systematically quantify the unequal burden of environmental harm and promote the equal enforcement of environmental law. For example, this report shows that using satellite-derived measures for monitoring compliance with environmental regulations could have potentially large equity implications. But despite recent efforts to increase the use of satellite data for such policy applications, satellite resources remain largely underutilized. While state and federal agencies are increasingly turning to satellite data for EJ research studies, these results often fall short of influencing decisionmaking (Holloway and Bratburd 2021). Barriers to use for EOs include difficulty in handling the native observations, a lack of trust in the accuracy of the data, and incompatibility of satellite-derived measures with legal compliance monitoring requirements (Prados et al. 2021). Produced as part of the VALUABLES Consortium, this paper aims to outline ways that NASA can use its data products to promote EJ and overcome the barriers faced in the use of satellite data to influence decisionmaking. Importantly, the set of recommendations provided here is not intended to substitute for NASA’s direct engagement with EJ communities to learn what would be of most value to them, but rather is meant to complement these efforts by providing a perspective from the environmental policy community. Specifically, the insights that this perspective can provide are based on environmental policy scholars’ understanding of how scientific information, including remotely sensed information, plays a role in the formation of policy within a variety of economic, political, and social contexts. In addition, the recommendations here are informed by the literature on policy evaluation and knowledge of which kinds of policies have proven to be more effective than others, including those with EJ dimensions. This report focuses on four broad categories of opportunities for promoting EJ: 1. leveraging EOs to reduce the inequitable burden of environmental harm 2. making NASA’s data products more accessible to EJ communities 3. developing new sensors and missions to fill EJ data gaps 4. contributing to the development of quantifiable metrics to measure progress toward EJ goals. This set of recommendations builds on existing efforts at NASA to increase the impact of satellite data along EJ dimensions. In particular, NASA’s Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (HAQAST) has a Tiger Team tasked with leveraging satellite data for EJ. HAQAST members are working with public stakeholders to identify communities disproportionately affected by environmental health risks, build capacity among EJ communities for using and interpreting satellite data sets, and increase the accessibility of satellite data for EJ applications. Additionally, in 2021, NASA announced a new funding opportunity providing an estimated $3 million in awards to advance progress on EJ domestically through the application of earth science, geospatial, and socioeconomic information. The aim of this document is to reinforce the need for this type of work at NASA and identify additional opportunities for advancing EJ using agency resources.",2023,"{""Druckenmiller, Hannah""}",NA,"report",NA,NA,"{""date"": ""2023/04//"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://media.rff.org/documents/WP_23-08.pdf"", ""database_provider"": ""Zotero""}","{}",NA,NA,NA,NA

Public land managers use various strategies for managing landscape conditions that can affect wildﬁre, broadly: fuel treatment (and other pre-ﬁre risk mitigation), ﬁre suppression, and post-ﬁre landscape rehabilitation. However, with any of these strategies there is considerable uncertainty in the outcomes that managers can obtain, and thus on the societal costs and beneﬁts associated with wildland ﬁre management. Managers address that uncertainty by using available information to inform their strategy choices. The value of information (VOI) to the land manager is deﬁned as the expected gains from improved wildland ﬁre management outcomes that result from using the information. This paper discusses estimating the value of information using two approaches: a microeconomic theoretical approach, and the Bayesian decisiontree approach frequently used in the VOI literature.

6447822,NA,"Landsat continuity: Issues and opportunities for land cover monitoring","Initiated in 1972, the Landsat program has provided a continuous record of earth observation for 35 years. The assemblage of Landsat spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, over a reasonably sized image extent, results in imagery that can be processed to represent land cover over large areas with an amount of spatial detail that is absolutely unique and indispensable for monitoring, management, and scientific activities. Recent technical problems with the two existing Landsat satellites, and delays in the development and launch of a successor, increase the likelihood that a gap in Landsat continuity may occur. In this communication, we identify the key features of the Landsat program that have resulted in the extensive use of Landsat data for large area land cover mapping and monitoring. We then augment this list of key features by examining the data needs of existing large area land cover monitoring programs. Subsequently, we use this list as a basis for reviewing the current constellation of earth observation satellites to identify potential alternative data sources for large area land cover applications. Notions of a virtual constellation of satellites to meet large area land cover mapping and monitoring needs are also presented. Finally, research priorities that would facilitate the integration of these alternative data sources into existing large area land cover monitoring programs are identified. Continuity of the Landsat program and the measurements provided are critical for scientific, environmental, economic, and social purposes. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Landsat; there are no other systems in orbit, or planned for launch in the short-term, that can duplicate or approach replication, of the measurements and information conferred by Landsat.

6670465,NA,"Wildland Fire Management And Air Quality In The Southern Sierra Nevada: Using The Lion Fire As A Case Study With A Multi-Year Perspective On Pm2.5 Impacts And Fire Policy","Management of fire is an important and controversial policy issue. Active fire suppression has led to a backlog of fuels, limited the ecological benefits of fire, and reduced short-term smoke impacts likely delaying these emissions to future generations over a larger spatial extent. Smoke impacts can be expected to increase as fire size and intensity increase and the fuel backlog is consumed; whether through reintroduction of fire under desirable conditions or through stand replacing fire. Land Management Agencies would like to increase the use of naturally ignited fires to burn during favorable conditions as a way to reduce catastrophic fires. This study provides information about the levels of air quality impacts expected from these types of fires and discusses some of the policy controversies of managed fire that propagate inconsistencies between agencies and enter the public discourse. The Lion Fire, a primarily low intensity 8,370ha fire that was extensively monitored for Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), is used to quantify impacts to air quality. PM2.5 monitoring sites are used to assess exposure, public health impacts, and subsequently quantify annual air quality during a year with a fire that is within the historic normal fire size and intensity for this area. Ground level PM2.5 impacts were found to be localized with 99% of the hourly Air Quality Index readings in the moderate or good category for the sites impacted by the fire. PM2.5 concentrations at sites nearest the fire were below annual federal air quality standards for PM2.5 with annual 98th percentile at the most impacted sites (Johnsondale, Kernville, and Camp Nelson) of 35.0, 34.0, and 28.0μgm-3 respectively. Smoke impacts to PM2.5 concentrations were not found to reach the populated Central Valley. The findings suggest that this type of fire can be implemented with minimal public health impacts thus allowing an opportunity for air and fire managers to alter policy to allow additional burning in an area with severe anthropogenic air pollution and where frequent widespread fire is both beneficial and inevitable. The more extensive air quality impacts documented with large high intensity fire may be averted by embracing the use of fire to prevent unwanted high intensity burns. A widespread increase in the use of fire for ecological benefit may provide the resiliency needed in Sierra Nevada forests as well as be the most beneficial to public health through the reduction of single dose exposure to smoke and limiting impacts spatially. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"{""Cisneros, R."",""Schweizer, D.""}","{""Air Pollutants"",""Air quality"",California,""Conservation of Natural Resources"",Fires,Humans,""Particle Size"",""Particulate Matter"",Policy,""Public health"",""Sierra Nevada [California]"",""Smoke impacts"",""United States"",""Wildland fire"",""air monitoring"",""air pollutant"",""air pollution"",""air pollution control"",""air quality standard"",""ambient air"",analysis,article,control,""ecosystem resilience"",""environmental impact"",""environmental impact assessment"",""environmental management"",""environmental planning"",""environmental protection"",fire,""fire management"",fuel,human,""population density"",""prescribed burning"",prevention,procedures,""protocol compliance"",""satellite imagery"",smoke,wildfire,""wildland fire management""}","journal",NA,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.06.007","{}","{cco}",2024-04-11 22:19:25,32501,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}"

6447816,NA,"Spatial and Temporal Dynamics and Value of Nature-Based Recreation, Estimated via Social Media","Conserved lands provide multiple ecosystem services, including opportunities for nature-based recreation. Managing this service requires understanding the landscape attributes underpinning its provision, and how changes in land management affect its contribution to human wellbeing over time. However, evidence from both spatially explicit and temporally dynamic analyses is scarce, often due to data limitations. In this study, we investigated nature-based recreation within conserved lands in Vermont, USA. We used geotagged photographs uploaded to the photo-sharing website Flickr to quantify visits by in-state and out-of-state visitors, and we multiplied visits by mean trip expenditures to show that conserved lands contributed US $1.8 billion (US $0.18–20.2 at 95% confidence) to Vermont’s tourism industry between 2007 and 2014. We found eight landscape attributes explained the pattern of visits to conserved lands; visits were higher in larger conserved lands, with less forest cover, greater trail density and more opportunities for snow sports. Some of these attributes differed from those found in other locations, but all aligned with our understanding of recreation in Vermont. We also found that using temporally static models to inform conservation decisions may have perverse outcomes for nature-based recreation. For example, static models suggest conserved land with less forest cover receive more visits, but temporally dynamic models suggest clearing forests decreases, rather than increases, visits to these sites.

The importance of taking social and cultural values of nature into account is increasingly recognised within ecosystem services research and policy. This notion is informing the development and application of social (or socio-cultural) valuation methods that seek to assess and capture non-material social and cultural aspects of benefits of ecosystems in non-monetary terms. Here, ‘values’ refer to the products of descriptive scientific assessments of the links between human well-being and ecosystems. This precise use of the values term can be contrasted with normative modes of understanding values, as underlying beliefs and moral principles about what is good and right, which also influence science and institutions. While both perspectives on values are important for the biodiversity and ecosystem services agenda, values within this space have mainly been understood in relation to assessments and descriptive modes of values. Failing to acknowledge the distinction between descriptive and normative modes bypasses the potential mismatch between people’s current values and sustainability transformations. Refining methodologies to more accurately describe social values risks simply giving us a more detailed account of what we already know—people in general do not value nature enough.

6659452,NA,"Identifying Associations Between Management Practices And Antimicrobial Resistances Of Sentinel Bacteria Recovered From Bulk Tank Milk On Dairy Farms","There is increasing emphasis on the need to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU) on dairy farms to reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria which could compromise animal health and impact human medicine. In addition to AMU, the role of farm management is an area of growing interest and represents an alternative route for possible interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of farm management practices and AMU on resistances of sentinel bacteria in bulk milk. Dairy farms from two, geographically separate locations within the British Isles were recruited as part of two study groups. Farm management data from study group 1 (n = 125) and study group 2 (n = 16) were collected by means of a face-to-face questionnaire with farmers carried out during farm visits. For study group 2, additional data on AMU was collated from veterinary medicine sales records. Sentinel bacterial species (Enterococcus spp. and E. coli), which have been reported to be of value in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) studies, were isolated from bulk tank milk to monitor antimicrobial susceptibilities by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). MIC data for both groups was used to generate an overall ""score"" for each farm. For both groups, this overall farm mean MIC was used as the outcome variable to evaluate the impact of farm management and AMU. This was achieved through use of elastic net modelling, a regularised regression method which also featured a bootstrapping procedure to produce robust models. Inference of models was based on covariate stabilities and bootstrapped P-values to identify farm management and AMU practices that have significant effects on MICs of sentinel bacteria. Practices which were found to be of importance with respect to Enterococcus spp. included management of slurry, external entry of livestock to the dairy herd, use of bedding materials and conditioners, cubicle cleaning routines and antibiotic practices, including use of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Practices deemed to be of importance for E. coli MICs included cubicle and bedding management practices, teat preparation routines at milking and the milking procedure itself. We conclude that a variety of routine farm management practices are associated with MICs of sentinel bacteria in bulk milk. Amendment of these practices offers additional possible routes of intervention, alongside alterations to AMU, to mitigate the emergence and dissemination of AMR on dairy farms.",2022,"{""Bradley, Andrew"",""Dottorini, Tania"",""Giebel, Katharina"",""Green, Martin"",""Hyde, Robert"",""Leach, Katharine"",""McLaughlin, Daniel""}","{""Dairy; Antimicrobial resistance; Farm management; Regularised regression; Bootstrap""}","ARTICLE",NA,"10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105666","{}","{cco}",2024-04-11 22:15:37,32501,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}"
6447812,NA,"Seasonal synchrony: the key to tick-borne encephalitis foci identified by satellite data","A previous analysis of tick infestation patterns on rodents in Slovakia suggested that the key to the focal distribution of western-type tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEv) in Europe is the geographically variable degree of synchrony in the seasonal activity of larval and nymphal Ixodes ricinus ticks. This prediction is here tested by examining records, from 7 different countries, of the seasonal variation in the abundance of larvae and nymphs feeding on rodents or questing on the vegetation. Larvae consistently started feeding and questing earlier in the year at sites within TBEv foci than elsewhere, so that they appeared in the spring as soon as nymphs were active. Such larval–nymphal synchrony is associated with a rapid fall in ground-level temperatures from August to October as revealed by the satellite-derived index of Land Surface Temperature (LST). Likewise, of 1992 pixels sampled on a grid across Europe, the 418 that fell within TBEv foci were characterized by a higher than average rate of autumnal cooling relative to the peak midsummer LST. It is proposed that such a seasonal temperature profile may cause unfed larvae to pass the winter in quiescence, from which they emerge synchronously with nymphs in the spring.",2000,"{""Green, R.

6669933,NA,"A Wireless Sensor Network For Urban Environmental Health Monitoring: Urbansense","Urban areas are generators of environmental emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), harmful air pollutants and noise, all with the potential to negatively impact the health and wellbeing of its human and non-human inhabitants. There is an urgent need to understand the characteristics of urban areas associated with variability in emissions and the potential for exposure to potential harmful environmental conditions. UrbanSense is a wireless sensor network (WSN) infrastructure designed to monitor environmental conditions at different temporal and spatial scales. The scalable infrastructure includes an extended range outdoor wireless sensing and data aggregation system, a web-based data management and visualization platform, and real-time event-based data stream integration. Sensors monitor changes in carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), noise (LAeq), as well as several meteorological conditions including wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. The implementation will provide opportunities for real-time data integration and an analysis system for environmental quality assessment, and may be realized on top of products arising from spatio-temporal (statistical) analyses and remotely-acquired data products such as satellite data. Sensor swapping and co-location with sensors from projects with different aims (traffic volume modelling and human tracking research) will add value for research in transportation planning, environmental regulation and policy and epidemiological studies focused on associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes.",2016,"{""Rainham, D.""}","{""Carbon dioxide"",""Carbon monoxide"",""Data integration"",""Data visualization"",""Environmental conditions"",""Environmental emissions"",""Environmental quality assessment"",""Environmental regulations"",""Epidemiological studies"",Health,""Information management"",""Meteorological condition"",""Noise generators"",""Scalable infrastructure"",Temporal,""Urban planning"",Wind,""Wind speed"",""Wireless sensor networks"",""atmospheric pollution"",""data management"",directions,""ecosystem health"",""environmental monitoring"",""environmental quality"",""health risk"",infrastructure,noise,sensor,""spatial scale"",""transportation planning"",""urban area"",visualization,""wind velocity""}","conference proceeding",NA,"10.1088/1755-1315/34/1/012028","{}","{cco}",2024-04-11 22:06:47,32501,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}"
6662042,NA,"Effects Of Farm Management Practices And Environmental Factors On Bulk Tank Milk Antibodies Against Gastrointestinal Nematodes In Dairy Farms Across Canada","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been used as a diagnostic tool to quantify levels of gastrointestinal nematodes in dairy cattle by measuring Ostertagia ostertagi antibodies in milk. Higher levels of O. ostertagi antibodies measured by ELISA methods, referred to as optical density ratios (ODRs), are associated with decreased milk production in dairy cattle. On-farm management practices (e.g. pasturing techniques and anthelmintic usage) can influence the exposure of cattle to nematode infections and the magnitude of acquired worm burdens. Additionally, environmental and climatic factors, such as land elevation and precipitation, may also influence the levels of gastrointestinal parasitism. This repeated cross-sectional study investigated the effect of farm management practices and surrounding environmental factors on bulk tank (BT) ODRs in herds from provinces across Canada, and further examined the potential effects of various anthelmintic treatment protocols on BT ODRs. A total of 195 herds contributed an average of 3.5 BT samples between December 2003 and April 2005. The farm management practices were recorded from a questionnaire asking producers about their pasturing methods (confined, pastured, etc.), pasture sharing practices (e.g. mixing heifers with milking cows) and anthelmintic treatments. Environmental data were downloaded online from various governmental databases (e.g. Natural Resources Canada, Statistics Canada, Environment Canada, etc.). Statistical models, accounting for repeated measures (multiple BT ODRs for each farm) and for clustering of farms within a region (province or ecoregion), were used to analyze environmental and farm management data. Overall, the greater the exposure that heifers and milking cows had to pasture, the higher the levels of anti-parasite antibodies detected in BT samples. Treating the entire herd or treating milking cows at calving reduced BT ODR values. Farms in areas with higher number of rainy days, higher normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, and lower land surface temperatures (LSTs), were also likely to have higher BT ODRs. Seasonal variation was such that late summer and early fall, when parasite load was at its highest, yielded larger BT ODRs. Due to the high clustering effect at the herd level, factors at the herd level (e.g. pasturing methods, anthelmintic administration) had a higher potential impact on bulk-tank measurements than the herd's surrounding environmental factors.

This disruption is unprecedented in the modern era of global observing networks, pervasive sensing and large-scale tracking of human mobility and behaviour, creating a unique test bed for understanding the Earth System. In this Perspective, we hypothesize the immediate and long-term Earth System responses to COVID-19 along two multidisciplinary cascades: energy, emissions, climate and air quality; and poverty, globalization, food and biodiversity. While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour.

6663910,NA,"Cold Atom Interferometry In Satellite Geodesy For Sustainable Environmental Management","Our Earth is a complex system. By monitoring the integrated geodetic-geodynamic processes, we can understand its sub-systems and geographical distribution of its resources. With the development of space techniques and artificial satellites, satellite geodesy era started, e.g., it became possible to observe a wide range of processes, occurring both on and below the Earth's surface. Such observations can be exploited not only in environmental activities, but also in societal activities like natural disasters monitoring. Thus, satellite geodesy can bring great benefits to “Climate action”, one of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nation: we can estimate the ice-sheet mass balance and study the impact of climate change by monitoring sea levels. This paper aims to investigate the possible implementation of cold atom sensors for future satellite gravity missions, which would improve our current knowledge of the Earth’s gravity field and contribute into the sustainable environmental management.

6668962,NA,"Environmental Intelligence For More Sustainable Infrastructure Investment","Intelligence is the ability to learn, understand and thus manage new or trying situations through reasoning (inferences based on facts or premises). Environmental Intelligence brings together multiple data streams (facts) from ground-based, satellite and citizen sources with cutting-edge hardware, software and analytical technology employing human reasoning and machine learning to better understand and manage the environment. The EC H2020 ReSET project (Restarting Economy in Support of Environment through Technology) funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 FET Proactive Programme under grant agreement No 101017857, brings together environmental scientists, social scientists, informatics specialists and stakeholders from five European countries to develop state of the art investment policy support systems. These combine the best available earth observation, crowdsourced and field-monitored data with sophisticated spatial policy support systems for biophysical and social processes. Harnessing combined machine and human intelligence, we seek to to understand best-bet options for 'build back better' investments that maximise environmental, economic and employment benefits. We are working at a series of demonstration sites in Europe where 'build back better' investments are active: Thames Gateway, OxCam Arc and Strand Aldwych in UK; Carasuhat Wetlands in Romania; Castilla Leon and Rivas VaciaMadrid in Spain and Bologna in Italy. Proposed investments include urban greening and traffic management to reduce air pollution and thermal extremes (Strand Aldwych, Bologna, Rivas Vaciamadrid); Natural Flood Management (Thames Gateway, OxCam Arc, Castilla-Leon), land use zoning for low impact tourism (Carasuhat) and green-grey approaches to flood and drought management (Castilla Leon). We bring together new hardware technologies enabling low-cost, distributed, IoT environmental monitoring using the FreeStation.org platform with further developments of our widely used policy support systems CotingNature and Eco:Actuary and enhanced activity and agent-based modelling in the Metronamica modelling framework. This is to better understand current environmental conditions in the areas proposed for investment and to simulate the impact of investment alternatives (business as usual grey, blended grey-green and fully green) on environment, economy and employment in the ReSET investment policy support system. Through this work, we tackle some key challenges of operationalizing environmental intelligence discussed here: • technology as an enabler of research and innovation rather than the key focus of research • live integration of complex data streams • ensuring usability and ease of use through co-design • scalability and relevance to a range of investment types and settings • reducing costs, enabling local maintenance and ensuring accessibility and legacy © 2021 ACM.",2021,"{""Burke, S."",""Douglas, C."",""Giordano, R."",""Lopez-Gunn, E."",""Mulligan, M."",""Scrieciu, A."",""Shi, M."",""Van Delden, H."",""Van Soesbergen, A.""}","{""Autonomous agents"",""Computational methods"",Economic,Economics,""Environmental intelligence"",""Environmental technology"",""Flood control"",""Flood management"",Floods,""Green infrastructure"",""Hardware technology"",""Infrastructure investment"",Investment,""Investment policies"",Investments,""Land use"",""Machine learning"",""Nature based solution"",""Nature based solutions"",""Policy support"",""Simulation platform"",""Support systems"",""Sustainable development"",""Sustainable infrastructure"",""social effects""}","conference proceeding",NA,"10.1145/3462203.3475916","{}","{cco}",2024-04-11 22:10:06,32501,"excluded","{""Value is not measured""}"

6447821,NA,"What’s It Worth? Estimating the Potential Value of Early Warnings of Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms for Managing Freshwater Reservoirs in Kansas, United States","Cyanobacterial blooms are an issue drawing increasing concern in freshwater lakes and reservoirs in the United States due to the real and sometimes perceived harms they can cause through cyanotoxin production or other effects. These types of blooms are often referred to as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). Cyanotoxin exposure can potentially lead to human health effects through recreation and consumption of drinking water and may impact fisheries, wildlife, domestic pets, and livestock. Characterizing the societal impacts of cyanotoxin production, exposure, and effects and estimating the potential value of information of an early warning system can inform and support freshwater lake and reservoir management decisions and future research directions. A Bayesian decision tree analysis was utilized to identify uses, users, and benefits of the information provided by this research. Specifically, the potential value related to a cyanoHAB early warning system, based on potential toxicity, was analyzed that would provide information two additional days earlier relative to cyanoHAB toxicity. The evaluation considers the application of this information for freshwater lake management - whether or not to post an advisory or warning to avoid recreational water contact. The model was parameterized with data from the state of Kansas and the value of avoided foregone recreation and avoided health effects was derived. The estimated annual value of information ranges between $565 thousand to $2.3 million (2018 United States Dollars (USD)) for the state of Kansas alone based on provided assumptions. The results demonstrate a lower bound of the value of a cyanoHAB early warning system and suggest additional research to understand how the use and value of this information could support research prioritization and further illustrate the return on research investment. This analysis does not incorporate the full suite of potential societal costs that may be associated with a cyanoHAB event such as drinking water treatment, impacts to irrigation, or power generation.",2022,"{""Loftin, Keith"",""Pindilli, Emily J.""}",NA,"journal","Frontiers in Environmental Science",NA,"{""url"": ""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.805165"", ""date"": ""2022-01-19"", ""access_date"": ""2023-10-05 19:00:53"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.805165/pdf?isPublishedV2=False"", ""short_title"": ""What’s It Worth?"", ""database_provider"": ""Frontiers""}","{}",NA,NA,NA,NA
