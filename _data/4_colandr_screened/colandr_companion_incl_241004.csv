6862826,"Where's Woolly? An Integrative Use Of Remote Sensing To Improve Predictions Of The Spatial Distribution Of An Invasive Forest Pest The Hemlock Woolly Adelgid","Non-native pests and pathogens present serious challenges to the management of forested ecosystems around the world. Early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented. Species distribution models (SDMs) and remote sensing (RS) methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage. However, previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used RS metrics that have biological meaning. We use RS difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, locations using MaxEnt in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DWGNRA). Brightness, greenness, wetness, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for December 1982 and 2010. A difference for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value. We compared two models, one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance. Variables with low importance were removed from both models, leaving NDVI, Wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models. The difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values. Despite this small difference in accuracy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1\% of total area) was approximately 1/2 of that predicted by the single year model (9.6\% of total area). These results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50\%, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach. This method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

6862721,"Land Use Change And Environmental Sustainability: The Case Of Lagos Metropolis","Land use is a most important factor in the distribution and functioning of ecosystems and benefits derived by man. The Malthusian geometric population growth and continuous demands for food, shelter, clothing, energy and even pleasure has led to depletion of natural resources. Land is limited in supply and its finite nature makes it a scarce resource that cannot meet its demand. The use of land is a reflection of our decisions, which will determine how sustainable our future will be. Detecting land use changes requires timely and accurate information which can be assured by using remotely sensed data and GIS. Analyzing the correlation between land use changes and their impacts is essential for spatial planning at various spatial levels (global, national, regional and local levels). A cursory look at the sporadic growth of the Lagos metropolis reveals an unquestionable exert of pressure on the existing rural land, agricultural and forests resources. This paper examines Spatio-temporal trends in land use and land cover changes in the Lagos Metropolitan region, especially the loss of forest resources and agricultural land to urban development. Landsat images were used to produce land use classification maps for a period spanning sixteen years (1990 and 2006). The study was limited to these two dates due to cost and difficulty of acquiring satellite imageries. The dynamics of land use change and its impact were discussed as major findings. The paper submits that effective spatial planning could minimize the impacts of land use changes that threaten biodiversity and ecosystems though timely and proper monitoring using remotesensing and GIS; it also recommends integrated spatial planning approach and deployment of environmental management plans. © 2012 WIT Press.","{""Dekolo, S.

6863292,"Using Bioacoustics To Enhance The Efficiency Of Spotted Owl Surveys And Facilitate Forest Restoration","The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an older-forest associated species that resides at the center of forest management planning in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, USA, which are experiencing increasingly large and severe wildfires and drought-related tree mortality. We leveraged advances in passive acoustic survey technologies to develop an acoustically assisted survey design that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project-level surveys for spotted owls, allowing surveys to be completed in a single year instead of in multiple years. We deployed an array of autonomous recording units (ARUs) across a landscape and identified spotted owl vocalizations in the resulting audio using BirdNET. We then evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in spotted owl vocalizations near occupied territories and the ability of a crew naïve to the location of occupied territories to locate spotted owls based on patterns of acoustic detections. After only 3 weeks of acoustic surveys, ≥1 ARU within 750 m of all 17 occupied territories obtained spotted owl detections across ≥2 nights. When active surveys using broadcast calling were conducted near ARUs with spotted owl detections by surveyors naïve to territory occupancy status and locations, surveyors located owls in 93% to 100% of occupied territories with ≤3 surveys. To further improve the efficiency of spotted owl surveys, we developed a statistical model to identify and prioritize areas across the Sierra Nevada for different survey methods (active only, acoustically assisted, no surveys) based on the expected probability of occupancy predicted from remotely sensed measurements of tree height and historical occupancy. Depending on managers' tolerance for false negatives, this model could help identify large areas that might not benefit from surveys based on low expected occupancy probabilities and areas where acoustically assisted surveys might enhance survey effectiveness and efficiency. Collectively, these findings can help managers streamline the survey process and thus increase the pace of forest restoration while minimizing potential near-term adverse effects on California spotted owls. © 2023 The Authors.

6903586,"Modelling And Evaluation Of Land Use Changes Through Satellite Images In A Multifunctional Catchment: Social, Economic And Environmental Implications","Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. ""S-Upstream"", ""S-Downstream"" and ""S-Total"". Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11\%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3\% for S-Up; 8.6\% for S-Down and 13\% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.",NA,"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101777",2024-09-26 00:50:29,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6863288,"Characterizing Off-Highway Road Use With Remote-Sensing, Social Media And Crowd-Sourced Data: An Application To Grizzly Bear (Ursus Arctos) Habitat","Characterizing roads is important for conservation since the relationship between road use and ecological impact can vary across species. However, road use is challenging to monitor due to limited data and high spatial-temporal variability, especially for unpaved roads, which often coincide with critical habitats. In this study, we developed and evaluated two methods to characterize off-highway road use across a large management area of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) habitat using: (1) a 'network-based' approach to connect human activity hotspots identified from social media posts and remotely detected disturbances and (2) an 'image-based' approach, in which we modeled road surface conditions and travel speed from high spatial resolution satellite imagery trained with crowd-sourced smartphone data. To assess the differences between these approaches and their utility for characterizing roads in the context of habitat integrity, we evaluated how behavioural patterns of global positioning system (GPS)-collared grizzly bears were related to road use characterized by these methods compared to (a) assuming all roads have equal human activity and (b) using a 'reference' road classification from a government database. The network- and image-based methods showed similar patterns of road use and grizzly bear response compared to the reference, and all three revealed nocturnal behaviour near high-use roads and better predicted grizzly bear habitat selection compared to assuming all roads had equal human activity. The network- and image-based methods show promise as cost-effective approaches to characterize road use for conservation applications where data is not available.","{""Coops, Nicholas C."",""Goodbody, Tristan R.

6691623,"Position paper: evaluation methods and techniques","This paper reviews methodologies in economics for valuing the benefits of geospatial data and services; including the value of open data. Section 2 explores the meaning of socioeconomic value and reviews the methodologies underpinning value assessment. It explains the theoretical background to economic welfare analysis, total turnover analysis and value added analysis. The use of different methods for economic impact assessment is then outlined. The methods include benefit cost analysis, multiplier analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling1. This section also outlines the background to value chain analysis and real options analysis. Examples of the application of these techniques are discussed. They include the application of earth observation to agricultural and water resource management and the use of mapping to improve decision making in areas such as emergency management, managing endangered species, conducting property tax assessments and verifying insurance claims. These examples illustrate the potential for geospatial data to deliver value over a wide and growing range of applications. Section 3 addresses the issues that arise in applying these techniques. It points out that the methodology selected must address the questions being asked by policy makers and/or users of geospatial data. In the current defensive fiscal environment experienced by governments in many OECD countries, it is important that the valuation method links the use of geospatial data services to a clearly defined and quantifiable outcome. There needs to be a ‘line of sight’ between application of geospatial data services and the benefits that are identified. The paper suggests that evaluations should clearly outline such relationships and suggests a hierarchy of methods that can be applied in such circumstances. The methods include cost effectiveness analysis, benefit cost analysis and regional and economy wide economic modelling. Section 4 comments on the issues that arise draws some conclusions and raises some questions for discussion. It concludes that there is a need to: align methodology to the decision maker’s needs; develop better evidence based economic assessments; adopt more structured approaches to addressing the rapid evolution in the use and application of geospatial data; develop greater capability in building better business cases; and reaching a consensus on internationally recognised methodologies. It also raises the possibility of greater international collaboration and research into building better business cases and establishing a community of experts to help advance the discipline of socioeconomic evaluation as applied to geospatial data and services.","{""Smart, Alan""}","https://www.geovalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Background-Position-paper-Smart1.pdf",2024-04-22 23:41:30,"included",NA,2014,"{}",NA
6447803,"Estimating the Value of Near-real-time Satellite Information for Monitoring Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon","We estimate the amount of avoided deforestation due to the use of near-real-time satellite imagery (DETER) to support the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), the conservation of indigenous and other protected areas, and compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (FC). We develop a Directed Acyclical Graph (DAG) that outlines some of the econometric challenges that arise from the role of policy in the estimation of satellite data on deforestation and consider that policy could be a mediator and/or a moderator along this causal chain. We control for policies that were introduced simultaneously with DETER, and allow for changes in the influences of prices, agricultural settlement, and forest conservation policies on deforestation after near-real-time monitoring was introduced. We find both direct impacts of DETER on deforestation, and indirect impacts via changes in the influences of commodity prices on deforestation. In total we estimate the amount of avoided deforestation is approximately 467-471 thousand km2 between 2001-2015, an area that is larger than the state of California, more than twice the amount of deforestation recorded in that region in the same time period, and translates to approximately 12 billion tons of avoided CO2. The net benefits of satellite monitoring range from US$1-5.4 billion per year when estimated using the WTP to preserve Amazon rainforest and between US$54 US$197 billion per year when estimating using the social cost of carbon.","{""Biggs, Trent"",""Caviglia-Harris, Jill"",""Mullan, Katrina"",""Ribeiro, Jime Rodrigues"",""Santiago, Thaís Ottoni"",""Sills, Erin"",""West, Thales A P""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2022,"{benchmark}",NA
6691648,"CEOS contributions to informing energy management and policy decision making using space-based Earth observations","Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the ""space arm"" for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan. This paper describes a coordinated program of demonstration projects conducted by CEOS member agencies and partners to utilize Earth observations to enhance energy management end-user decision support systems. We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers.

6691588,"Free satellite imagery and digital elevation model analyses enabling natural resource management in the developing world: studies from Eastern Indonesia","Decentralization of governance and natural resource management is an ongoing process in many parts of Africa and Asia. Natural resource management requires spatial land resource data for planning. However, currently the financial and human capacity for natural resource mapping, monitoring and modelling remains low in local governments. In this context, this paper explores how new opportunities provided by the increasing availability of free satellite imagery, digital elevation data and open source spatial analysis software, can be applied by local government and NGOs to conduct sophisticated natural resource mapping and modelling in ways that meet their needs and incorporates local knowledge. Reported are cases of a local government using free geospatial data and GIS software to improve evidence-based natural resource management in the developing world with a focus on raster data applications for satellite image analysis and terrain modelling. It is argued that, through removing barriers to uptake, such applications provide a means of decentralizing landscape analysis skills to improve local natural resource management. This hypothesis is supported through examples of a local government applying these tools in eastern Indonesia, and within this context barriers to wider adoption are explored.","{""Fisher, Rohan""}","https://doi.org/10.1111/sjtg.12210",2024-04-22 23:39:07,"included",NA,2017,"{maybe}","{""GIS|remote sensing|capacity building| open source|DEM|decentralization""}"
6863101,"On The Future Of Argo: A Global, Full-Depth, Multi-Disciplinary Array","The Argo Program has been implemented and sustained for almost two decades, as a global array of about 4000 profiling floats. Argo provides continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar. The successful installation of the Argo array and its innovative data management system arose opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and technological innovation. Through the data system, Argo provides fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of autonomous profiling floats. Following recent advances in platform and sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years ago to (i) improve Argo's global coverage and value beyond the original design, (ii) extend Argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to global implementation is described. The objective is to create a fully global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary Argo Program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in situ elements of the Global Ocean Observing System (Legler et al., 2015). The integrated system will deliver operational reanalysis and forecasting capability, and assessment of the state and variability of the climate system with respect to physical, biogeochemical, and ecosystems parameters. It will enable basic research of unprecedented breadth and magnitude, and a wealth of ocean-education and outreach opportunities.","{""Alford, Matthew H."",""Bakker, Dorothee"",""Baringer, Molly"",""Belbeoch, Mathieu"",""Bittig, Henry C."",""Boss, Emmanuel"",""Calil, Paulo"",""Carse, Fiona"",""Carval, Thierry"",""Chai, Fei"",""Claustre, Herve"",""Conchubhair, Diarmuid O."",""Dall'Olmo, Giorgio"",""Desbruyeres, Damien"",""Fennel, Katja"",""Fer, Ilker"",""Ferrari, Raffaele"",""Forget, Gael"",""Freeland, Howard"",""Fujiki, Tetsuichi"",""Garabato, Alberto Naveira"",""Gehlen, Marion"",""Greenan, Blair"",""Hallberg, Robert"",""Hibiya, Toshiyuki"",""Hosoda, Shigeki"",""Jayne, Steven"",""Jochum, Markus"",""Johnson, Gregory C."",""Johnson, Kenneth"",""Kang, KiRyong"",""King, Brian"",""Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas"",""Kortzinger, Arne"",""Le Traon, Pierre-Yves"",""Lenn, Yueng-Djern"",""Maze, Guillaume"",""Mork, Kjell Arne"",""Morris, Tamaryn"",""Moum, James"",""Nagai, Takeyoshi"",""Nash, Jonathan"",""Oke, Peter"",""Olsen, Are"",""Owens, W.

6691571,"Enhancing the standardized drought vulnerability index by integrating spatiotemporal information from satellite and in situ data","Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.","{""Oikonomou, Panagiotis""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.058",2024-04-26 18:46:25,"included",NA,2019,"{}","{""Drought|Drought vulnerability|Drought impacts|SDVI|Water resources|South platte""}"

Coupled with variable rate application technologies, this added information has the potential to provide environmental benefits through reduced pesticide applications. However, producers face a complicated adoption decision because output prices and crop yields are uncertain. A model is developed to examine the potential value of remote sensing information to pesticide applications in an option-value framework under uncertainty. Simulations suggest that remote sensing information could decrease pesticide use, but uncertainty and irreversibility are likely to limit technological adoption by farmers.

6903665,"Spatial Coverage Of Monitoring Networks: A Climate Observing System Simulation Experiment","Observing systems consisting of a finite number of in situ monitoring stations can provide high-quality measurements with the ability to quality assure both the instruments and the data but offer limited information over larger geographic areas. This paper quantifies the spatial coverage represented by a finite set of monitoring stations by using global data-data that are possibly of lower resolution and quality. For illustration purposes, merged satellite temperature data from Microwave Sounding Units are used to estimate the representativeness of the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN). While many metrics exist for evaluating the representativeness of a site, the ability to have highly accurate monthly averaged data is essential for both trend detection and climatology evaluation. The calculated correlations of the monthly averaged upper-troposphere satellite-derived temperatures over the GRUAN stations with all other pixels around the globe show that the current 9 certified GRUAN stations have moderate correlations (r >= 0.7) for approximately 10\% of the earth, but an expanded network incorporating another 15 stations would result in moderate correlations for just over 60\% of the earth. This analysis indicates that the value of additional stations can be quantified by using historical, satellite, or model data and can be used to reveal critical gaps in current monitoring capabilities. Evaluating the value of potential additional stations and prioritizing their initiation can optimize networks. The expansion of networks can be evaluated in a manner that allows for optimal benefit on the basis of optimization theory and economic analyses.",NA,"10.1175/jamc-d-17-0040.1",2024-09-27 22:39:09,"included",NA,NA,"{""probably not""}",NA

While conservation scientists now more often aim to incorporate human-related factors, a critical yet unquantified challenge remains: to identify which areas people use for recreation outside urban centers. To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media ""big data"" and remote sensing tools. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between 2004 and 2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and seminatural areas attracting visitors were defined as areas both highly photographed and non-lit. The number of Flickr photographers within protected areas was found to be a reliable surrogate for estimating visitor numbers as confirmed by local authority censuses (r = 0.8). Half of all visitors' photos taken in protected areas originated from under 1\% of all protected areas on Earth (250 of 27 000). The most photographed protected areas globally included Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks (USA), and the Lake and Peak Districts (UK). Factors explaining the spatial variation in protected areas Flickr photo coverage included their type (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites have higher visitation) and accessibility to roads and trails. Using this approach, we identified photography hotspots, which draw many visitors and are also unlit (i.e., are located outside urban centers), but currently remain largely unprotected, such as Brazil's Pantanal and Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni. The integrated big data approach developed here demonstrates the benefits of combining remote sensing sources and novel geo-tagged and crowd-sourced information from social media in future efforts to identify spatial conservation gaps and pressures in real time, and their spatial and temporal variation globally.","{""Crandall, David"",""Kark, Salit"",""Levin, Noam""}","10.1890/15-0113.1.sm",2024-07-12 19:45:45,"included",NA,2015,"{}","{""conservation; defense meteorological satellite program (DMSP); Flickr; geo-tagged data; light pollut""}"

To date, the empirical evidence for this comes from studies that have shown how enhanced soil information can alter agricultural practices to yield higher returns. This study attempts to estimate the economic value of soil information generated by a host of new proximal and in situ geophysical methods for the assessment of the following soil properties: carbon content, water content, clay content, bulk density, and soil depth. The study also adopts a novel approach to the economic valuation of soil information by employing for the first time a choice experiment to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of potential users of the digital maps and their features. The choice experiment took the form of an online survey, administered to about a thousand individuals from the wider soil community. The results reveal significant WTP for maps of high resolution and accuracy that offer map interpretation in addition to a number of soil properties.","{""Diafas, Iason""}","https://doi.org/10.2136/vzj2012.0198",2024-04-26 18:57:30,"included",NA,2012,"{}",NA

6863150,"Portability Of Semantic And Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning Methods To Analyse Social Media For Near-Real-Time Disaster Monitoring","Up-to-date information about an emergency is crucial for effective disaster management. However, severe restrictions impede the creation of spatiotemporal information by current remote sensing-based monitoring systems, especially at the beginning of a disaster. Multiple publications have shown promising results in complementing monitoring systems through spatiotemporal information extracted from social media data. However, various monitoring system criteria, such as near-real-time capabilities or applicability for different disaster types and use cases, have not yet been addressed. This paper presents an improved version of a recently proposed methodology to identify disaster-impacted areas (hot spots and cold spots) by combining semantic and geospatial machine learning methods. The process of identifying impacted areas is automated using semi-supervised topic models for various kinds of natural disasters. We validated the portability of our approach through experiments with multiple natural disasters and disaster types with differing characteristics, whereby one use case served to prove the near-real-time capability of our approach. We demonstrated the validity of the produced information by comparing the results with official authority datasets provided by the United States Geological Survey and the National Hurricane Centre. The validation shows that our approach produces reliable results that match the official authority datasets. Furthermore, the analysis result values are shown and compared to the outputs of the remote sensing-based Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The information derived from different sources can thus be considered to reliably detect disaster-impacted areas that were not detected by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, particularly in densely populated cities.","{""Havas, Clemens"",""Resch, Bernd""}","10.1007/s11069-021-04808-4",2024-07-13 00:12:58,"included",NA,2021,"{}","{""Social media; Disaster management; Machine learning; Semantic topic analysis; Geospatial analysis""}"

For many years Landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made Landsat data accessible via the internet for free. Substantial increases in downloads of Landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, serving government, private sector, and civil society. The Landsat program hence provides an example to space agencies worldwide on the value of open access for Earth Observation data and has spurred the adaption of similar policies globally, including the European Copernicus Program.

6863338,"Assessing The Influence Of Land-Cover Change And Conflicting Land-Use Authorizations On Ecosystem Conversion On The Forest Frontier Of Madre De Dios, Peru","Despite the many benefits natural forests provide, they are being lost worldwide at unsustainable rates as development frontiers expand. One approach to improving the efficacy of natural forest conservation efforts is to refine local forest conservation policies based on insights from the place-based study of conservation policies and land-use and land-cover change (LULC) dynamics. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of LULC and conservation policies on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru. The main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efficacy of designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conversion of granting conflicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation areas. Using statistical matching and a GIS-based analysis of LULC, this research shows that for the period 2006-2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios significantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly variable across conservation designations. Also, when present, conflicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, specifically overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation. This finding demonstrates that authorizing conflicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes. This case study also provides examples of how local forest conservation policies can be improved through detailed and frequent analyses of LULC and conservation policies, particularly in dynamic frontier landscapes where LULC and socio-economic conditions are rapidly changing.

Large amounts of international aid poured in to assist in the relief and reconstruction efforts. Amongst this effort, were investments in basic earth observation data from in-situ, airborne and space observations. While the use of this data is assumed to be crucial, few efforts have gone into quantifying the benefits of its acquisition. The objectives of this study were to interview a cross-section of agencies operating in Banda Aceh and across the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam on the use, sources and quality of earth observation data in the relief/reconstruction effort; and to analyze and quantify the value that earth observation data brings to the relief/reconstruction effort based on the survey results and specific examples. Key findings from the interviews point to an overall improvement in the spatial data situation since the tsunami. Problems identified included insufficient training, lack of timely data and sometimes poor spatial resolution. Specific examples of the costbenefits of earth observation data were typically on the order of millions of dollars and involved large time savings.","{""McCallum, Ian""}","http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/8741/",2024-04-23 22:07:54,"included",NA,2008,"{}",NA

6863506,"Sar And Lidar Temporal Data Fusion Approaches To Boreal Wetland Ecosystem Monitoring","The objective of this study was to develop a decision-based methodology, focused on data fusion for wetland classification based on surface water hydroperiod and associated riparian (transitional area between aquatic and upland zones) vegetation community attributes. Multi-temporal, multi-mode data were examined from airborne Lidar (Teledyne Optech, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, Titan), synthetic aperture radar (Radarsat-2, single and quad polarization), and optical (SPOT) sensors with near-coincident acquisition dates. Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA). The methodology was repeated in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) to determine the transferability of the methods to other boreal environments. Water mask frequency analysis showed accuracies of 93\% to 97\%, and kappa values of 0.8-0.9 when compared to optical data. Concordance results comparing the semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 were found to be 98\% similar, suggesting little change in wetland surface water extent between these two years. The results illustrate that the decision-based methodology and data fusion could be applied to a wide range of boreal wetland types and, so far, is not geographically limited. This provides a platform for land use permitting, reclamation monitoring, and wetland regulation in a region of rapid development and uncertainty due to climate change. The methodology offers an innovative time series-based boreal wetland classification approach using data fusion of multiple remote sensing data sources.","{""Brisco, Brian"",""Chasmer, Laura"",""Cobbaert, Danielle"",""Devito, Kevin"",""Hopkinson, Chris"",""Montgomery, Joshua""}","10.3390/rs11020161",2024-09-30 21:36:17,"included",NA,2019,"{maybe?}","{""SAR; Lidar; boreal wetlands; data fusion; decision-based methodology; time series""}"

In our model, the air patrolling schedule is determined by the Nesterov index, which is calculated from observed weather data. We use two weather data sets based on ldquoroughrdquo and ldquofinerdquo grids. The reduction of the total burned area, associated with an air patrolling schedule based on the ldquofinerdquo grid, indicates the benefits of using better weather observations. We, also, consider a stochastic model to simulate forest fires and explore the sensitivity of the model with respect to the quality of input data. Finally, we investigate the system of systems effect.

Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning–based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning–based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","{""Smythe, Isabella""}","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120025119",2024-04-26 19:08:16,"included",NA,2022,"{}","{""poverty|targeting|satellite imagery|Nigeria""}"

Periodic wildfires are an urgent problem to be solved. This research uses big data from relevant departments to extract environmental indicators that affect wildfires, including satellite images, meteorological observations, and field surveys and establishes a risk model for the Spatio-temporal distribution of wildfires based on risk analysis. Previous studies using Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to assess fire severity and distinguish wildfire ruins did not deal with the impact of atmospheric humidity on dNBR values. In this study, an adjustable fire threshold was developed to enable dNBR to improve the accuracy of identifying wildfire locations. Regarding the temporal distribution of wildfire risks, environmental vulnerability cannot specifically reflect the frequency of actual wildfires. If the hazard degree is introduced to calculate the wildfire risk, the coefficient of determination can be increased from 0.49 to 0.79. The verification of the village boundary zone depicts that the risk analysis can effectively show the temporal and spatial distribution of wildfire hotspots. On this basis, a village-level wildfire disaster prevention strategy can be formulated.","{""Chen, Yung-Chau"",""Lin, Chao-Yuan"",""Shieh, Pei-Ying"",""Wang, Po-Cheng"",""Wu, Shao-Wei""}","10.1007/s11069-022-05300-3",2024-07-12 19:32:54,"included",NA,2022,"{}","{""Remote sensing; Principal component analysis; Fire hazard; Fire vulnerability; Normalized burn ratio""}"

Since the most common methods of landslide hazard assessment using simple inventories and weighted overlays are heavily dependent on three-dimensional terrain visualization and analysis, stereo satellite images from the IKONOS Very High Resolution (VHR) sensor are used for this study. The DEMs created from IKONOS stereo images appear to be much more accurate and sensitive to micro-scale terrain features than a DEM created from digital contour data with a 2 m contour interval. Pan-sharpened stereo IKONOS images permit interpretation of recent landslides as small as 2-3 m in width as well as relict landslides older than 50 years. A cost-benefit analysis comparing stereo air photo interpretation with stereo satellite image interpretation suggests that stereo satellite imagery is usually more cost-effective for detailed landslide hazard assessment over large areas. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

6691527,"A Scalable Earth Observations-Based Decision Support System for Hydropower Planning in Africa","Hydropower is a key part of the increasing shift in power production from nonrenewables to renewable energy. In regions such as Africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty elimination. However, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often suboptimal due to the lack of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts. Here, we present a decision support system (DSS) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal time scales by combining data from earth observation satellites (EOS) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical models and hydrologic modeling. The large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based measurements. In addition, an EOS evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow in calibrating hydrologic models. Compared to a DSS forced with a climatological forecast (zero-skill), the hydropower production with the new DSS increased by 20%. The study highlights the advantage of using data from EOS in overcoming the issue of data scarcity in water resources applications, particularly in developing regions of the world such as Africa.","{""Koppa, Akash""}","https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12914",2024-04-23 22:15:21,"included",NA,2021,"{maybe}","{""hydropower|decision support system|remote sensing|water resources""}"
6903588,"Mapping For Coral Reef Conservation: Comparing The Value Of Participatory And Remote Sensing Approaches","Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66\%; RS: 76\%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.1325",2024-09-26 00:31:49,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6863157,"Global Multi-Scale Grid Integer Coding And Spatial Indexing: A Novel Approach For Big Earth Observation Data","With the exponentially growing earth observation data of specific sensor-determined resolutions and update frequencies, earth observation has irreversibly arrived in the Big Data era, enabling new insights in science and engineering. With great opportunity comes great challenges regarding efficient and effective data management because earth observation data is of different scales and characterized by complexity in spatial relationships related to the real world. To overcome the challenges is crucial for, for instance, data mining, land surveying, and especially emergency mapping for disaster response. To improve the querying efficiency of big earth observation data, we proposed a novel data management approach: Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding and Spatial Indexing. Among our contributions are: (1) proposing Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding Model (GMGICM), which presents clustering property in both the scale dimension and spatial dimension, and theoretically facilitates an efficient querying; (2) deliberately applying GMGICM on multi-scale earth observation data spatial indexing, which results in one-dimensional data index, which can be queried using simple B-tree, inversion, and other one-dimensional indexes; (3) designing a strategy to assure the completeness of spatial querying, which is not well solved by existing grid-based coding models. The advantages of our proposed approach have been demonstrated with both simulated and real remote sensing data, with spatial operation 20 times as fast as Geohash and spatial querying 10 times as fast as Oracle Spatial on average. The proposed approach can be easily adapted for three or higher-dimensional earth observation data and bring potential benefit to all big earth observation data analytic projects.","{""Guo, Congzhou"",""Lai, Guangling"",""Lei, Yi"",""Li, He"",""Qiu, Chunping"",""Tong, Xiaochong"",""Wu, Xiangyu"",""Zhang, Yong"",""Zhang, Yongsheng""}","10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.03.010",2024-07-12 19:29:39,"included",NA,2020,"{}","{""Multi-scale grid; Integer Coding; Clustering property; Data management; Big earth observation data; "",querying}"

6447795,"Value of information for climate observing systems","The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions.

This paper also highlights how the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) would contribute to ensure the actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda; and how the Global Earth Observations System of Systems meets requirements for efficient investments in science and technology and a good return on investment, which is elaborated in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on development financing. Through a number of examples, we first discuss how extensive EO use would: provide a substantial contribution to the achievements of the SDGs by enabling informed decision-making and by allowing monitoring of the expected results; improve national statistics for greater accuracy, by ensuring that the data are “spatially-explicit” and directly contribute to calculate the agreed SDG Targets and Indicators support the fostering of synergy between the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements by addressing cross-cutting themes such as climate and energy; and facilitate countries’ approaches for working across different development sectors, which is, according to the special adviser on the 2030 Agenda, a key challenge to achieve the SDGs. We then focus on the role that GEO could play in enabling actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda by directly addressing the Strategic Development Goal 17 on partnerships.","{""Anderson, Katherine""}","https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2017.1333230",2024-04-23 22:11:28,"included",NA,2017,"{maybe}","{""Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)|Group on Earth Observations (GEO)|the 2030 Agenda|Earth observati""}"
6863414,"Analysis Of Suspended Particulate Matter And Its Drivers In Sahelian Ponds And Lakes By Remote Sensing (Landsat And Modis): Gourma Region, Mali","The Sahelian region is characterized by significant variations in precipitation, impacting water quantity and quality. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of 'values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27\% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.","{""Diawara, Mamadou"",""Grippa, Manuela"",""Kergoat, Laurent"",""Martinez, Jean-Michel"",""Merlet, Sebastien"",""Robert, Elodie"",""Soumaguel, Nogmana""}","10.3390/rs9121272",2024-07-15 22:54:01,"included",NA,2017,"{}","{""SPM; turbidity; surface water; remote sensing; West Africa""}"

As fire costs continue to rise, timely and comprehensive fire information becomes increasingly critical to response and rehabilitation efforts. The NASA Rehabilitation Capability Convergence for Ecosystem Recovery (RECOVER) post-fire decision support system is a server-based application designed to rapidly provide land managers with the information needed to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This study evaluated the efficacy of RECOVER through structured interviews with land managers (n = 19) who used RECOVER and were responsible for post-fire rehabilitation efforts on over 715 000 ha of fire-affected lands. Although the benefit of better-informed decisions is difficult to quantify, the results of this study illustrate that RECOVER's decision support capabilities provided information to land managers that either validated or altered their decisions on post-fire treatments estimated at over US\$ 1.2 million and saved nearly 800 h of staff time by streamlining data collection as well as communication with local stakeholders and partnering agencies.","{""Lindquist, Eric"",""Lippitt, Frances"",""Schnase, John L."",""Stegner, Tesa"",""Toombs, William"",""Weber, Keith""}","10.1071/wf18010",2024-07-16 23:29:48,"included",NA,2018,"{}","{""communication; fire management; planning; remote sensing""}"

Variability in climate has been linked to variability in fisheries, specifically salmon stocks of the Pacific Northwest. The ability to forecast El Niño events already exists and is likely to improve in coming years. An accurate prediction may have value because it allows for better management decisions. In this article, we develop a bioeconomic model of the coho salmon fishery and derive the value of information from improved El Niño forecasting ability. We find that a perfect El Niño forecast results in an annual welfare gain of approximately $1 million, while imperfect forecasts lead to smaller gains. Results also suggest that optimal management in the face of uncertainty involves a “conservative” management strategy, resulting in lower harvest, higher wild fish escapement, and lower hatchery releases than management in the absence of such uncertainty.","{""Costello, Christopher""}","https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1244062",2024-04-25 02:28:50,"included",NA,2020,"{}","{""coho salmon|El Nino|value of information|Q220|Q250|economic analysis""}"

In fact, the term ‘public good’ has a more specific meaning, originating in the discipline of Economics, which carries with it a set of assumptions and implications about how markets operate. In this context a public good has two main characteristics: non-rivalry and nonexcludability. In their most common digital format, Earth observation data can appear to be both nonrivalrous and non-excludable. However, it is not the digital medium itself which controls the ‘publicness’ of a good but the conditions of access to that good.

6862756,"Evaluation Of Earth Observation Systems For Estimating Environmental Determinants Of Microbial Contamination In Recreational Waters","Public health risks related to the microbial contamination of recreational waters are increased by global environmental change. Intensification of agriculture, urban sprawl, and climate change are some of the changes which can lead to favorable conditions for the emergence of waterborne diseases. Earth observation (EO) images have several advantages for the characterization and monitoring of environmental determinants that could be associated with the risk of microbial contamination of recreational waters in vast territories like Canada. There are a large number of EO systems characterized by different spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolutions. Also, they have different levels of accessibility. In this study, we compared several EO systems for the estimation of environmental determinants to assess their usefulness and their added value in monitoring programs of recreational waters. Satellite images from EO systems WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, SPOT-5/HRG, Landsat-5/TM, Envisat/MERIS, Terra/MODIS, NOAA/AVHRR, and Radarsat-2 were acquired in 2010 and 2011 in southern Quebec, Canada. A supervised classification of these images with a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to estimate five key environmental determinants (agricultural land, impervious surfaces, water, forest, and wetlands) within the area of influence of 78 beaches. Logistic regression models were developed to establish the relationship between fecal contamination of beaches and environmental determinants derived from satellite images. The power prediction of these models and criteria such as accuracy of classified images, the ability of the sensor to detect environmental determinants in the area of influence of beaches, the correlation between the estimated environmental determinants in the area of influence by the sensor with those estimated by very high spatial resolution reference sensors (WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1), and general criteria of accessibility (cost of the images, imaging swath, satellite revisit interval, hours of work, and expertise and material required to process the images) were used to evaluate the EO systems. The logistic regression model establishing the relationship between environmental determinants from Landsat-5/TM images and the level of fecal contamination of beaches is the one which performs best. These images are also those that best meet all of the evaluation criteria. This study showed that environmental determinants like agricultural lands and impervious surfaces present in the area of influence of beaches are those which contribute the most to the microbial contamination of beaches. Our study demonstrated the utility and the added value that EO images could bring to programs monitoring the microbial contamination of recreational waters. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","{""Brazeau, S."",""Essono, F.

6863515,"Monitoring Canopy Quality And Improving Equitable Outcomes Of Urban Tree Planting Using Lidar And Machine Learning","Urban tree canopies are fundamental to mitigating the impacts of climate change within cities as well as providing a range of other important ecosystem, health, and amenity benefits. However, urban tree planting initiatives do not typically utilize data about both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the tree canopy, despite height being a critical determinant of the quality and value of urban canopy cover. We present a novel pipeline that uses airborne LiDAR data to train a multi-task machine learning model to generate estimates of both canopy cover and height in urban areas. We apply this to multi-source multi-spectral imagery for the case study of Chicago, USA. Our results indicate that a multi-task UNet convolutional neural network can be used to generate reliable estimates of canopy cover and height from aerial and satellite imagery. We then use these canopy estimates to allocate 75,000 trees from Chicago's recent green initiative under four scenarios, minimizing the urban heat island effect and then optimizing for an equitable canopy distribution, comparing results when only canopy cover is used, and when both canopy cover and height are considered. Through the introduction of this novel pipeline, we show that including canopy height within decision-making processes allows the distribution of new trees to be optimised to further reduce the urban heat island effect in localities where trees have the highest cooling potential and allows trees to be more equitably distributed to communities with lower quality canopies.","{""Disney, Mathias"",""Francis, John"",""Law, Stephen""}","10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128115",2024-09-30 17:12:33,"included",NA,2023,"{}","{""Canopy Cover; Canopy Height; Environmental Equity; Green Infrastructure; Urban Heat Island""}"

Traditional techniques, including satellite remote sensing and ground-based techniques used to assess habitat condition, have limitations in terms of costs and low resolution of satellite platforms. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI (GNDVI) have potential for assessing habitat condition, e.g., forage quantity and quality, vegetation cover and degradation, soil erosion and salinization, fire, and pollution of vegetation cover. We, therefore, examined how the recently emerged Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform and the traditional Sentinel-2 differs in indications of habitat condition using NDVI and GNDVI. We assigned 13 survey plots to random locations in the major land cover types: three survey plots in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands, and two in riverine and mosaics cover types. We used a UAV-mounted, multi-spectral sensor and obtained Sentinel-2 imagery between February and March 2020. We categorized NDVI and GNDVI values into habitat condition classes (very good, good, poor, and very poor). We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and linear regression model in R-software. The results revealed higher sensitivity and ability of UAV to provide the necessary preliminary diagnostic indications of habitat condition. The UAV-based NDVI and GNDVI maps showed more details of all classes of habitat conditions than the Sentinel-2 maps. The linear regressions results showed strong positive correlations between the two platforms (p < 0.001). The differences were attributed primarily to spatial resolution and minor atmospheric effects. We recommend further studies to test other vegetation indices.","{""Alward, Richard D."",""Bukombe, John K."",""Kija, Hamza K."",""Mangewa, Lazaro J."",""Munishi, Linus K."",""Nasolwa, Emmanuel R."",""Ndakidemi, Patrick A.""}","10.3390/earth3030044",2024-07-15 22:55:24,"included",NA,2022,"{}","{""remote sensing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; vegetation indices; wildlife habitats; satellite platforms;""}"

A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves.

There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts.

However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017-2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%-30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.",NA,"10.5194/tc-16-159-2022",2024-09-27 18:39:31,"included",NA,NA,"{validation,""probably not""}",NA

Despite this potential, these datasets continue to be underused around the world. In this article, we combine a recently established global water resources reanalysis that was developed within the EartH2Observe research project, and in-situ data in the Magdalena Cauca Macrobasin in Colombia. Through rigorous hydrological modelling we evaluate the contribution of this new information to the derivation of water availability indices used to support water policy and management. Results confirm the complementarity of the reanalysis, with water management indices derived from the reanalysis data showing good comparison to values obtained using in-situ data only. Indeed, the estimation of simple indices such as an Aridity Index and a Water Regulation Index show to be a suitable method for assessing and comparing the different reanalysis datasets. We also explore the value of the reanalysis and earth observations datasets in the study of climate and land use change scenarios in the basin. While considering the associated uncertainties, results show that on average rainfall is projected to increase in the basin and thus available water resources. Deforestation will increase the water balance due to lower evapotranspiration. However, reduced fog deposition in deforested cloud forest areas will lead to a decrease in the water balance. The promising results of the comparison have bolstered the confidence of the national hydro-meteorological agency to include the evaluated reanalysis datasets in the national water resources evaluation, complementing available in-situ datasets.","{""Arboleda, Pedro"",""Burke, Sophia"",""Duque, Nicolas"",""Garcia, Camila"",""Kaune, Alexander"",""Lopez, Patricia"",""Rodriguez, Erasmo"",""Sanchez, Ines"",""Vega, Carolina"",""Werner, Micha"",""Zamora, David""}","10.1007/s11269-019-02236-5",2024-07-19 18:26:33,"included",NA,2020,"{}","{""eartH2Observe project; Magdalena-Cauca Macrobasin (MCMB); Hydrological modelling; Colombia; Aridity ""}"

This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5â€“10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.","{""Bouma, Jetske A.""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.07.023",2024-04-22 02:29:11,"included",NA,2011,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""Value of information|Earth Observation|Cost-effectiveness analysis|Marine water quality management|B""}"
6903585,"Vermont Global Warming Solutions Act: The Costs Of Inaction From Land Conversions","The Vermont (VT) Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA, 2020) sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets at 26\% below 2005 by 2025, 40\% below 1990 by 2030 and 80\% below 1990 by 2050 for energy-related emissions only. Vermont's omission of GHG emissions from land conversions could result in significant costs of inaction (COI), which could hinder the state's mitigation and adaptation plans and result in climate crisis-related risks (e.g., credit downgrade). Science-based spatio-temporal data of GHG emissions from soils because of land conversions can be integrated into the conceptual framework of ""action"" versus ""inaction"" to prevent GHG emissions. The application of soil information data and remote sensing analysis can identify the GHG emissions from land conversions, which can be expressed as ""realized"" social costs of ""inaction"". This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for VT by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. These results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions, which can be linked to VT's climate action plan. A failure to considerably reduce emissions from land conversions would increase climate change costs and potential legal consequences for VT and beyond its borders.",NA,"10.3390/laws11030048",2024-09-30 01:45:05,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6903632,"Enhancing Land Cover Mapping And Monitoring: An Interactive And Explainable Machine Learning Approach Using Google Earth Engine","Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been applied to solve various remote sensing problems. To fully leverage the power of AI and ML to tackle impactful remote sensing problems, it is essential to enable researchers and practitioners to understand how AI and ML models actually work and thus to improve the model performance strategically. Accurate and timely land cover maps are essential components for informed land management decision making. To address the ever-increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution maps, this paper developed an interactive and open-source online tool, in Python, to help interpret and improve the ML models used for land cover mapping with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The tool integrates the workflow of both land cover classification and land cover change dynamics, which requires the generation of a time series of land cover maps. Three feature importance metrics are reported, including impurity-based, permutation-based, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) value-based feature importance. Two case studies are presented to showcase the tool's capability and ease of use, enabling a globally accessible and free convergent application of remote sensing technologies.

6862973,"Can Remote Sensing Fill The United States' Monitoring Gap For Watershed Management?","Remote sensing has been heralded as the silver bullet in water quality modeling and watershed management, and yet a quantitative mapping of where its applicability is likely and most useful has not been undertaken so far. Here, we combine geospatial models of cloud cover as a proxy for the likelihood of acquiring remote scenes and the shortest time of travel to population centers as a proxy for accessibility to ground-truth remote sensing data for water quality monitoring and produce maps of the potential of remote sensing in watershed management in the United States. We generate several maps with different cost-payoff relationships to help stakeholders plan and incentivize remote sensing-based monitoring campaigns. Additionally, we combine these remote sensing potential maps with spatial indices of population, water demand, ecosystem services, pollution risk, and monitoring coverage deficits to identify where remote sensing likely has the greatest role to play. We find that the Southwestern United States and the Central plains regions are generally suitable for remote sensing for watershed management even under the most stringent costing projections, but that the potential for using remote sensing can extend further North and East as constraints are relaxed. We also find large areas in the Southern United States and sporadic watersheds in the Northeast and Northwest seaboards and the Midwest would likely benefit most from using remote sensing for watershed monitoring. Although developed herein for watershed decision support in the United States, our approach is readily generalizable to other environmental domains and across the world.","{""Kumar, Saurav"",""Kumar, Swetha Madhur"",""Sridharan, Vamsi Krishna""}","10.3390/w14131985",2024-07-12 19:22:02,"included",NA,2022,"{}","{""remote sensing; geographical information systems; watershed management; water quality; decision supp""}"

Now, citizens and rights advocacy groups are increasingly utilising satellite-collected images to interrogate justice issues; to document, prevent and verify rights abuses; and to imagine and propose social change. Yet while other communication technologies have received substantial critical analysis regarding their value as tools of social justice, activism and resistance, satellites have received comparatively scant attention. This article examines the uses of satellite-collected images in human rights contexts including the opportunities, challenges and risks they pose.

If prediction of impending disaster is to be useful, those affected by catastrophe and those who come to their aid must work together. A global strategy based on a vision for disaster management will fail if those affected by hazards are not involved in their own disaster preparation, relief efforts and rehabilitation. Local people are experts in ground knowledge; all that is needed is for those with expertise in remote sensing to pass on their skills, knowledge and data in a way that can be understood and valued. To do this, those threatened by catastrophe must understand how disaster relates to their lives, how satellite data can be used with confidence to prepare for local hazards and how to apply information that can help lessen the effects of catastrophe. This can be achieved by making available remotely sensed images with simple explanations that enhance vegetation, topography and geology.

We then assessed, under the maturity matrix framework (MMF 2.0), the current potential of satellite data applications on the SDG indicators that were classified into the sustainability pillars. Despite the SDG framework having more focus on socio-economic aspects of sustainability, there has been a rapidly growing literature in the last few years giving practical examples in using earth observation (EO) to monitor both environmental and socio-economic SDG indicators; there is a potential to populate 108 indicators by using EO data.

6863675,"Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland By Coupling Optical And Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote Sensing","Plastic Mulching (PM) is criticized for causing environmental problems in spite of the benefits to increase crop yield. Accurate map of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) is demanded to monitor the usage of plastic mulches and to mitigate its environmental damages. However, mapping PMF with remote sensing data over large scale is still technically challenging due to its variable spectral characteristic. This paper proposed a Random Forest (RF) workflow to map PMF by coupling multi-resource satellite observations, including high- and medium- resolution optical imageries and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries. Under the context of two typical PMF regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, China, we test the performance of the proposed method. Results indicated that coupling optical and SAR remote sensing data improved the mapping accuracy significantly. There were different strategies for optimal data coupling. Coupling of three data, which are the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) data, Landsat-8 data and Radarsat-2 data, generated the highest mapping accuracy. Besides, coupling the GF-1 data with SAR data produced better accuracy than coupling the Landsat-8 data with SAR data. Compared with the accuracies derived from the coupling of two data (such as coupling GF-1 data with Radarsat-2 data and coupling Landsat-8 data with Radarsat-2 data), coupling the three data improved the overall accuracies by 0.39 to 4.93%. Compared with the mapping accuracy produced from Radarsat-2 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling increased by 20.96 and 26.06%, respectively, in Jizhou and Guyuan. When compared with the mapping accuracy of GF-1 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling improved by 4.77% both in Jizhou and Guyuan. In general, contribution of optical remote sensing data was greater than that of SAR data for mapping PMF. Whereas, the SAR data also made great contribution to improve the mapping accuracy of PMF. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","{""Fei, L."",""Yuncai, H."",""Zhongxin, C.""}","10.1080/01431161.2020.1763510",2024-07-12 19:40:52,"included",NA,2020,"{}","{China,""Decision trees"",""Environmental damage"",""Environmental problems"",Farms,Guyuan,""Ningxia Huizu"",""Optical remote sensing data"",""Overall accuracies"",Photomapping,""Radar imaging"",""Remote sensing"",""Remote sensing data"",""Synthetic aperture radar""}"
6863531,"The Gavkhouni Wetland Dryness And Its Impact On Air Temperature Variability In The Eastern Part Of The Zayandeh-Rud River Basin, Iran","The Gavkhouni wetland provides many environmental and economic benefits for the central region of Iran. In recent decades, it has completely dried up several times with substantial impacts on local ecosystems and climate. Remote sensing-based Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in combination with in-situ data were used to investigate the trend of the Gavkhouni wetland dryness and the associated impact on the variability of local air temperature. The results indicate that the wetland has increasingly experienced drier conditions since the year 2000. The wetland was almost completely dry in 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017. In addition, the results show that Gavkhouni wetland dryness has a significant impact on local climate, increasing the mean seasonal air temperature by ~1.6◦ C and ~1◦ C in spring and summer, respectively. Overall, this study shows that remote sensing imagery is a valuable source for monitoring dryness and air temperature variations in the region. Moreover, the results provide a basis for effective water allocation decisions to maintain the hydrological and ecological functionality of the Gavkhouni wetland. Considering that many factors such as latitude, cloud cover, and the direction of prevailing winds affect land surface and air temperatures, it is suggested to use a numerical climate model to improve a regional understanding of the effects of wetland dryness on the surrounding climate. © 2022 by the authors.

6863684,"Historical Eco-Environmental Quality Mapping In China With Multi-Source Data Fusion","Since the initiation of economic reforms and opening up, China has witnessed an unprecedented rate of development across all sectors. However, the country has also experienced severe ecological damage, surpassing that of many other nations. The rapid economic growth has come at the expense of the environment, revealing a significant lack of coordination between urbanization and eco-environmental protection in China. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and continuous historical dataset of China’s eco-environmental quality (EEQ) based on remote sensing, allowing for the analysis of spatial and temporal changes. Such data would provide objective, scientific, and reliable support for China’s eco-environmental protection and pollution prevention policies, while addressing potential ecological risks resulting from urbanization. To achieve this, the entropy value method is employed to integrate multi-source remote sensing data and construct an evaluation system for China’s EEQ. Historical data from 2000 to 2017 is plotted to illustrate China’s EEQ over time. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The entropy method effectively facilitates the construction of China’s eco-environmental quality assessment system. (2) From 2000 to 2017, approximately 39.7% of China’s regions witnessed a decrease in EEQ, while 60.3% exhibited improvement, indicating an overall enhancement in EEQ over the past eighteen years. (3) The Yangtze and Yellow River basins experienced improved EEQ due to China’s ecological restoration projects. (4) The future EEQ in China demonstrates a subtle positive trend across diverse contexts. This study departs from conventional approaches to EEQ evaluation by leveraging the advantages of multivariate remote sensing big data, including objectivity, timeliness, and accessibility. It provides a novel perspective for future eco-environmental quality evaluation. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Cao, L."",""Wu, S."",""Xu, D."",""Zhao, C.""}","10.3390/app13148051",2024-07-15 16:04:46,"included",NA,2023,"{}","{China,""eco-environment quality"",""entropy method"",""remote sensing""}"
6863115,"The Role Of Remote Sensing Data And Methods In A Modern Approach To Fertilization In Precision Agriculture","The precision fertilization system is the basis for upgrading conventional intensive agricultural production, while achieving both high and quality yields and minimizing the negative impacts on the environment. This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost-and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions. State-of-the-art remote sensing techniques allowed hybrid interpolation to predict the sampled data supported by remote sensing data such as high-resolution multispectral, thermal and radar satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imagery in the analyzed studies. The representative overview of conventional and modern approaches to precision fertilization was performed based on 121 samples with phosphorous pentoxide (P2 O5 ) and potassium oxide (K2 O) in a common agricultural parcel in Croatia. It visually and quantitatively confirmed the superior prediction accuracy and retained local heterogeneity of the modern approach. The research concludes that remote sensing data and methods have a significant role in improving fertilization in precision agriculture today and will be increasingly important in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

6691710,"Integrating Earth observation data into geospatial databases that support public health decisions","There are several reasons why public health communities do not use information from Earth observations routinely. Most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads. The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the United States. Several Earth observations (EO) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement. Output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Eta version) model (NCEP/Eta). Simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by NCEP/Eta’s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based Continuous Air Monitoring System (CAMS). The simulations were rerun after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from MODIS (MOD-12). For the CAMS test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns. Additional EO data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from SRTM, dustgenerating areas derived from MOD-15’s Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, soil moisture data from AMSR-E, and aerodynamic surface roughness. Ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence.","{""Morain, S.A.""}","https://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVI/part4/WG-VIII-2-2.pdf",2024-04-25 02:21:49,"included",NA,2006,"{}","{""Earth observation|System integration|Internet GIS|Public health/medical|Environmental monitoring|Spa""}"

The workshop, entitled ""Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations: Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions,"" brought together more than 60 international experts including economists, scientists, and engineers to consider the state of the science and applications of valuing Earth observations (EO).\n\nThis 2-day workshop built upon previous activities developed under the GEOValue initiative. This workshop brought together expert analysts from multiple disciplines and backgrounds who are developing methods to identify and measure the value of information generated from the use of satellite and in-situ data. The mix of government agencies, international financial institutions, and independent consultants who participated in the workshop blended to develop a rich mix of views, approaches, and outcomes.\n\nDuring the first part of the workshop, the focus was on the latest science in valuing EO. A number of methodologies were described. Approaches generally assess the societal benefits of specific actions (for example, investments in EO). Some methods focus on broad measures of economic activity (for example, gross domestic product) or methods to assess total economic value such as contingent valuation surveys. Alternatively, use-case approaches (a use case is defined as an evaluation in which one or more decisions, applications, or other uses of data, information, and information products are specifically considered) start with the specific actions and how information is used to support decision making and affect outcomes. \n\nThe second part of the meeting was focused on the use and development of value chains and decision trees. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. In terms of EO, the value chain approach can be applied to consider societal benefits of the data and assess the value of data and data features. The EO value chain considers the geospatial data sources and the processing of the data into value added information to be incorporated into decision-support systems, leading to decision maker's actions. To understand the value of EO, one would also need to recognize the demand side of the equation or how EO benefits users. Extending the value chain concept and incorporating tenets of Bayesian decision making, a decision tree would include one or more use cases. The value provided by the marginal increase in information could flow from one or several parts of the supply side of the value chain. The decision tree is based on the premise that information has no value if it is not used in at least one decision. By connecting the value chain and the decision tree, a framework is created that allows for conceptualizing the value of EO in its many uses. One can then apply economic techniques to monetize the marginal benefit of an outcome with information versus one without. \n\nA third part of the meeting applied the value chain and decision-tree frameworks to five specific thematic areas, each with the focus of using information for a decision point: \n- Effect of increasing temperatures on human health; \n- Flooding- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts to safety and property damage; \n- Energy and mineral supply- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts of shortfalls on the economy; and\n- Effects of natural hazards on transportation systems- Effects on mobility, safety, and the economy.\n\nDuring the working session, five separate groups worked to define and delineate the value chains and decision trees associated with each topic, discussing the related challenges and data needs. The outcomes were reported back to the full group. Because of the complexity of the topics, most groups first identified a network of value chains and then narrowed the scope to develop a single value chain to address their group's topic. Although they worked separately and on different topics, the groups came to similar conclusions, concurring that the value chain and decision-tree frameworks are very effective for informing quantitative impact assessments and developing a relatable narrative to assist the public in understanding the link between EO and citizens.","{""Pearlman, Francoise""}","https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20191033",2024-04-22 02:48:01,"included",NA,2019,"{}",NA

In particular, satellites and RS can be used for space and earth observations, support military operations, precision agriculture, meteorological forecasting, communication and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking and monitoring of utility networks. In this paper, we analyse the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellites and RS.

6691696,"A Conceptual Framework for Assessing the Benefits of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems","The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “benefit chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.","{""Fritz, Steffen""}","https://doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2008.926688",2024-04-22 02:30:50,"included",NA,2008,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""Benefit assessment|conceptual framework|cost-benefit analysis|Global Earth Observation System-of-Sys""}"
6903569,"A Data-Driven Approach To Hurricane Debris Modeling","The large amount of debris generated in the aftermath of hurricane and storm events can cause severe financial and logistical burdens to coastal communities. Existing debris estimation models mainly focus on wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50\%, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that can account for other types of debris while improving accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic framework to estimate the presence and amount of waterborne debris following a severe storm using machine learning (ML) techniques as a function of relevant storm and landcover parameters. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models, employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris removal database for Hurricane Ike, respectively. The results show that the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a misclassification error of 5.56\% for the debris presence predictive model, and a normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 11.98 for the debris volume model, the lowest RMSE of the tested algorithms. Dual-layer ML models are also investigated, incorporating the debris presence as a predictor in the debris volume model. The results show a percent error of 11.29\% for the dual-layer model and an approximately 5.4\% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not incorporate debris presence. The generated debris volume and presence models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource allocation following a storm event.",NA,"10.1061/jwped5.wweng-1945",2024-10-01 17:55:48,"included",NA,NA,"{""probably not""}",NA

6691653,"Identifying Methods for Quantifying the Societal Impacts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generates tremendous value for the nation. The Agency provides critical environmental data, forecasts, cutting edge knowledge, management and stewardship that the United States needs to plan for and react to in a constantly changing global environment. The Agency, however, needs to do more to understand and measure exactly how its activities, products and services affect the well-being of the nation. Existing and emerging social science methods can be harnessed to help the Agency assess the degree to which we are meeting our mission goals and to improve the value we provide to society. The first NOAA Science Challenge workshop brought together policy makers at NOAA with social science leaders from inside and outside of the Agency to explore methods for better quantifying the ways in which NOAA affects society. As an initial step in better understanding the broader societal impacts of NOAA, we focused on the NOAA line offices and programs that deal most directly with the public: the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (including the National Sea Grant College Program), and the programs that support climate activities at NOAA (the Climate Program Office and the National Climate Data Center). While it is easy to see why society needs NOAA, the workshop revealed just how difficult it can be to rigorously quantify the societal impact of NOAA’s activities, products, and services. As a first step, the line offices identified specific NOAA products, services, and activities (outputs) for which they would like to quantify societal impacts. These examples were meant to highlight a diversity of products and services. We focused initially on relatively straightforward examples that could serve as both a departure for discussion and illustrations of how programs within the Agency might begin thinking about quantifying the societal impact of their work. For each output, the line offices developed a narrative (story) that linked the output with a sector of society and ultimately a state of societal well-being. Workshop participants further developed these stories and explored methods and approaches to better quantify how these NOAA outputs affect societal well-being. The workshop identified many methods that can be applied to better understand the way the Agency affects society. One class of methods is data denial, in which intermediate and final users of NOAA data products are asked to operate in the absence of NOAA data. Other methods involve retrospective analyses of the ways in which the public and private sector have used NOAA outputs. Still other approaches require that users imagine how their decisions would differ in the absence of NOAA activities, products and services.Table 1 provides a sampling of value chains, metrics, and methods developed at the workshop. The participants identified a variety of metrics to measure societal well-being and change including revenues, economic value, lives saved, sense of place, preferences and attitudes, property damages, and crop yields. While one day is insufficient to fully develop these methods and approaches, the workshop was an important opportunity for policy makers at NOAA and social scientists to work together to understand how the Agency can harness social science methods to do a better job of meeting its mission goals. Certain line offices are still more adept at measuring the baseline of societal well-being than in trying to tease out the contribution of any single program or activity. This corresponds, in large part, to the enterprise nature of many activities at the Agency – many programs inside and outside of the Agency combine to achieve our mission goals. As the Agency moves forward in its efforts to understand how NOAA affects society, the methods and metrics used to do so will be refined and improved. Possible next steps in the process include:\n○ More enterprise level approaches to developing value chains and valuations.\n○ Follow-up workshops or symposia on methods for quantifying the societal impacts of specific types of NOAA outputs including: research, information, and weather.","{""Atmospheric Administration"",""National Oceanic""}","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353247247_NOAA_Science_Challenge_Workshop_Identifying_Metho",2024-04-22 03:01:11,"included",NA,2011,"{}",NA

6863626,"From Forest Dynamics To Wetland Siltation In Mountainous Landscapes: A Rs-Based Framework For Enhancing Erosion Control","Human activities have caused a significant change in the function and services that ecosystems have provided to society since historical times. In mountainous landscapes, the regulation of services such as water quality or erosion control has been impacted by land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially the loss and fragmentation of forest patches. In this work, we develop a Remote Sensing (RS)-based modelling approach to identify areas for the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) (i.e., natural forest conservation and restoration) that allow reducing the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to siltation in mountainous regions. We used time series Landsat 5TM, 7ETM+, 8OLI and Sentinel 2A/2B MSI (S2) imagery to map forest dynamics and wetland distribution in Picos de Europa National Park (Cantabrian Mountains, northern Spain). We fed RS-based models with detailed in situ information based on photo-interpretation and fieldwork completed from 2017 to 2021. We estimated a forest cover increase rate of 2 ha/year comparing current and past LULC maps against external validation data. We applied this forest gain to a scenario generator model to derive a 30-year future LULC map that defines the potential forest extent for the study area in 2049. We then modelled the distribution of wetlands to identify the areas with the greatest potential for moisture accumulation. We used an S2 mosaic and topography-derived data such as the slope and topographic wetness index (TWI), which indicate terrain water accumulation. Overall accuracy scores reached values of 86\% for LULC classification and 61\% for wetland mapping. At the same time, we obtained the potential erosion using the NetMap software to identify potential sediment production, transport and deposition areas. Finally, forest dynamics, wetland distribution and potential erosion were combined in a multi-criteria analysis aiming to reduce the amount of sediment reaching selected wetlands. We achieved this by identifying the most suitable locations for the conservation and restoration of natural forests on slopes and in riparian areas, which may reduce the risk of soil erosion and maximise sediment filtering, respectively. The results show a network pattern for forest management that would allow for controlling erosion effects across space and time at three levels: one, by reducing the load that originates upslope in the absence of forest cover; two, by intersecting runoff at watercourses related to sediment transport; and three, by a lack of former barriers, by trapping erosion near to the receiving wetland systems, main river axes and contributing streams. In conclusion, the proposed methodology, which could be transferred to other mountain regions, allows to optimise investment for erosion prevention and wetland conservation by using only very specific areas of the landscape for habitat management (e.g., for NBS implementation).","{""Alvarez-Martinez, Jose Manuel"",""Barquin, Jose"",""Hernandez-Romero, Gonzalo"",""Perez-Silos, Ignacio"",""Silio-Calzada, Ana"",""Vieites, David R.""}","10.3390/rs14081864",2024-07-18 21:44:30,"included",NA,2022,"{maybe}","{""Cantabrian Cordillera; Ecosystem Services; habitat mapping; LULC; mountainous wetlands; nature-based""}"
6863625,"Mapping Floristic Gradients Of Forest Composition Using An Ordination-Regression Approach With Landsat Oli And Terrain Data In The Central Hardwoods Region","Mapping forest properties with supervised remote sensing has historically and increasingly remained vital to research and management efforts, and the demand for such products will only increase as better tools and data increase the usability of such maps. Multispectral imagery by the Landsat program has been an invaluable resource for forest type characterization for several decades. As an alternative to traditional classification approaches dominating these efforts, we instead employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping forest composition as floristic gradients across a ∼5000-km2 forestland in southeastern Ohio's Central Hardwoods. Plot data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) from a comprehensive sample of both overstory and understory woody plants across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination solution. Floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reflectance provided by a multitemporal Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI) image and various terrain variables using Random Forests models. Approximately 61%, 49%, and 25% of the floristic variation among the three axes of the NMDS ordination were related to the remotely-sensed variables during regression modeling. The axes were predicted onto three images and merged to a RGB color composite for the final floristic gradient map, displaying multivariate vegetation variation across the landscape in terms of variation in color. The color values, by referencing ordination space position within the original solution, provide a statistical approximation of the taxonomic composition of individual forest stands in relation to the plot data. We found this approach highly effective and an attractive alternative to traditional classifications. It is time-efficient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is expressed in continuous fields rather than arbitrary breaks, and less subjective, overcoming the generalization problem inherent in categorizing vegetation assemblages a priori. Moving forward, our model will be a valuable tool in developing suitable management options on individual forest stands for the restoration of desired species, adapting to a changing climate, and improving wildlife habitat in forestlands across the Central Hardwoods. © 2018","{""Adams, B.

6691578,"Using satellite data to fill the gaps in the US air pollution monitoring network","Compliance with the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is determined at the county level using local air pollution monitors. However, the vast majority of counties have zero or one monitor, and air pollution concentrations can vary dramatically over short distances. In addition, recent evidence suggests monitor placement may be skewed to make NAAQS compliance easier. As a result, the network of air pollution monitors may not detect all areas with pollution levels that exceed the NAAQS. This paper explores this possibility using satellite-derived data on fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) to assess NAAQS compliance for the continental United States at a 1 kilometer (km) resolution. We compare the satellite-based assessments with official attainment designations made by the terrestrial monitor network and calculate the number of people living in “misclassified” areas—areas with PM2.5 levels that exceed the NAAQS but are classified as being in attainment based on the ground monitors and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) official determination. We estimate that about 24.4 million people are living in these misclassified areas— about as many as are living in properly classified nonattainment areas—and that if such areas had sped up their PM2.5 reductions as much as nonattainment areas did, 5,452 premature deaths would have been avoided, a welfare gain to society of $49 billion.","{""Sullivan, Daniel""}","https://www.rff.org/valuables/impact-assessments/",2024-04-26 18:56:51,"included",NA,2018,"{}","{""Clean Air Act|Ambient Air Pollution|Air Pollution Minitoring""}"

In situ monitoring of subsidence in this large geographic area has historically been limited. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) sought the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's assistance for satellite- and aircraft-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) monitoring of subsidence during the 2012-2016 drought. InSAR was successful in cost-effectively providing first-ever synoptic measurement of land subsidence over the entire San Joaquin Valley. The purpose of the monitoring was screening or hotspot detection of impact areas affecting critical water infrastructure. Long-term cumulative land subsidence has substantially reduced the conveyance capacity of sections of major valley canals and the monitoring revealed that subsidence rates observed during the drought ranked with maximum historically observed rates, highlighting risks to water infrastructure. InSAR also identified new and rapidly emerging hotspots adjacent to critical water infrastructure. The success of the InSAR monitoring for drought response resulted in CDWR's decision to subsequently provide InSAR data as technical assistance to local agencies required to comply with recent state groundwater management legislation.","{""Bekaert, David P.

Benefit estimates (as measured by revenue increases) are based on the assumptions that when better data is delivered those data will be integrated into stock assessment models; when better data are integrated into the models the new data will actually improve the reliability of the models; and when the reliability of the models is improved predictions will be accepted by managers or industry members.","{""Wellman, Katharine""}","https://doi.org/10.1080/08920750701868051",2024-04-26 23:07:42,"included",NA,2008,"{}","{""Alaska fisheries|coastal observing systems|economic benefits|value of information""}"
6863661,"Global Flood Mapper: A Novel Google Earth Engine Application For Rapid Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Sar","Timely and accurate information about the extent of floodwater is critical for emergency planning and disaster management efforts. Despite the advances in computational resources and in the field of remote sensing, there is a clear gap that restricts the disaster community from leveraging the technological resources in real time, which impedes on-ground response efforts. To bridge this gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, the paper presents a new web application, the Global Flood Mapper (GFM) that allows the user to generate flood maps quickly and without getting into technical intricacies. To derive the flood extent from Sentinel-1 satellite data, the pre-flood collection is considered as base and anomaly cells in the during-flood image(s) are identified using Z-Score values. Second, it advances an existing flood mapping method to (a) Map the peak of the floods by combining ascending and descending scenes when necessary, and (b) Check for false positives in hilly terrains by adding slope and elevation mask parameters. By comparing our results with Sentinel-2 MSI derived flood maps and field photographs, we show that the GFM can generate flood maps with precision. The GFM can be used to map and download the extent of multiple flood events of an area as vector data (.kml format), which can be a critical input for flood modeling and risk and impact assessments.

6447798,"The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response","Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions “on the ground” more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) from applying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.","{""Bolten, John D."",""Oddo, Perry C.""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019,"{benchmark}",NA

Outcomes are driven by differences across two data products that can be used to inform regulations to limit ship strikes. In the reference case, vessel speed limits depend on species distribution data from shipboard surveys. In the counterfactual case, speed limits depend on species distributions predicted by WhaleWatch, a federal data product incorporating information from several remote sensing technologies. The VOI is identified as the difference in costs to marine shipping operators under the reference and counterfactual cases for regulation of vessel speeds. We estimate that the annual VOI of WhaleWatch is US$21–332 million, depending on the conservation goals of the modeled regulation.

However, remote sensing images still have some difficulty generating continuous long-term river discharge. To address this problem, we developed a new method coupling the remote sensing hydrology station method (RSHS) with statistical regression downscaling, using data from optical satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), radar satellites (Sentinel-1), and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We applied this method to monitor monthly river discharge for small- and medium-scale rivers from 2016 to 2020 on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and evaluated the accuracy of the results. The results show that (1) by applying the newly constructed method, the water body continuity index obtained by Landsat-8 increased by 7\% and the average river length percentage in the channel reached 90.7\%, a 40\% increase; (2) there were only 10 river flow data points, on average, in the 5-year period obtained before this method was applied; after this method was applied, more than 50 river flow data points could be obtained, on average, extending the quantity of data fivefold; in addition, improper extreme values could also be avoided; (3) with better continuity of water body distribution, the images provided steadier river widths. The relative error of daily flow estimation from Landsat-8 images was reduced by 60\% and the mean percentage error was reduced by one-fourth. The relative error of the multisource remote sensing composited flow was reduced by 37\% with a reduction in the mean percentage error of over a half; (4) in addition, we found that when the threshold difference between water bodies and land in remote sensing images is more than 0.2, the impact of water body recognition error on flow accuracy can be ignored. This method helps to overcome the absence of remote sensing methods for the long-term estimation of flow series in small- and medium-scale rivers, improves the accuracy of remote sensing methods for calculating flow, and provides ideas for regional water resource management and utilization.",NA,"10.3390/rs14081798",2024-09-26 00:41:42,"included",NA,NA,"{""probably not"",maybe}",NA
6903587,"Evaluating Remote Sensing Approaches For Mapping The Bathymetry Of Lake Manzala, Egypt","Lake Manzala is considered the largest lagoon in Egypt. The lake has significant economic and environmental impacts that should be managed based on management models. The bathymetry of this lake, which is time consuming and laborious to obtain in the field, is one of the key input files for developing hydrological models of the lake. Remote sensing technology is used to determine satellite bathymetric maps with reasonable accuracy. The objective of the present work was to utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to determine the bathymetry of Lake Manzala. Generalized linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, bagging (BAG, an ensemble regression algorithm), least-squares boosting fitting ensemble (LSB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used in this study to process the images and manage the database of each image. The Landsat images were corrected for atmospheric conditions and the sunglint effect. Then values from the logarithms of corrected reflectance bands (coastal, blue, green, and red) and their ratio logarithms at locations corresponding to GPS surveys were extracted. Two assessing metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation (R), were used to calibrate the derived logarithm values for the model using observed data for the lake. The results show that the BAG and decision tree approaches perform well for Lake Manzala. Such methodologies should be applied for bathymetry determination, especially for shallow lakes, to save monitoring effort and costs. This approach facilitates the development of management models for lakes.",NA,"10.1007/s41207-021-00285-0",2024-09-26 00:45:19,"included",NA,NA,"{maybe}",NA
6863297,"Design Of Terrace Drainage Networks Using Uav-Based High-Resolution Topographic Data","Hillslope viticulture has a long history in Mediterranean Europe, and still holds important cultural and economic value. Steep hillsides have widely been levelled by terraces, in order to control surface water flow and facilitate cultivation. However, under unsustainable management and growing rainfall aggressiveness, terraced vineyards have become one of the most erosion-prone agricultural landscapes. The Valcamonica valley in Lombardy (Italy) presents a typical example of an ancient wine production region where rural land abandonment has previously caused widespread degradation of the traditional terracing systems. Recently, a local revival of wine production led to restoration plans of the terraces and their drainage functioning, to safeguard productivity and hydrogeologic safety. In this study, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey was carried out to reconstruct an accurate and precise 3D terrain model of a Valcamonica vineyard through photogrammetry. The resulting high-resolution topographic data allowed insights of surface flow-induced soil erosion patterns based on the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII). Three diverse drainage networks were designed and digitally implemented, allowing scenario analysis of the costs and benefits in terms of potential erosion mitigation. The presented methodology could likely improve the time-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of similar restoration plans in degraded landscapes.","{""Pijl, Anton"",""Roder, Giulia"",""Sofia, Giulia"",""Tarolli, Paolo"",""Tosoni, Michele""}","10.3390/w11040814",2024-09-30 17:34:32,"included",NA,2019,"{}","{""terraces; drainage design; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); high-resolution topography; remote sensing""}"
6863481,"Normalizing Land Surface Temperature For Environmental Parameters In Mountainous And Urban Areas Of A Cold Semi-Arid Climate","Normalization of land surface temperature (LST) relative to environmental factors is of great importance in many scientific studies and applications. The purpose of this study was to develop physical models based on energy balance equations for normalization of satellite derived LST relative to environmental parameters. For this purpose, a set of remote sensing imagery, meteorological and climatic data recorded in synoptic stations, and soil temperatures measured by data loggers were used. For modeling and normalization of LST, a dual-source energy balance model (dual-EB), taking into account two fractions of vegetation and soil, and a triple-source energy balance model (triple-EB), taking into account three fractions of vegetation, soil and built-up land, were proposed with either regional or local optimization strategies. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different modeling results, correlation coefficients and root mean square difference (RMSE) were computed between modeled LST and LST obtained from satellite imagery, as well as between modeled LST and soil temperature measured by data loggers. Further, the variance of normalized LST values was calculated and analyzed. The results suggested that the use of local optimization strategy increased the accuracy of the normalization of LST, compared to the regional optimization strategy. In addition, no matter the regional or local optimization strategy was employed, the triple-EB model out-performed consistently the dual-EB model for LST normalization. The results show the efficiency of the local triple-EB model to normalize LST relative to environmental parameters. The correlation coefficients were close to zero between all of the environmental parameters and the normalized LST. In other words, normalized LST was completely independent of the environmental parameters considered by this research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

6863535,"Wetland Landscape Spatio-Temporal Degradation Dynamics Using The New Google Earth Engine Cloud-Based Platform: Opportunities For Non-Specialists In Remote Sensing","The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica. We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region. This GEE application illustrates new opportunities for biosystems engineers and other scientists to integrate historical vegetation and land cover data into comprehensive datasets to understand human impacts on ecosystems, and provides the guidance to do so.","{""Alonso, A."",""Kennedy, R.

6691528,"Enhancing the Application of Earth Observations for Improved Environmental Decision-Making Using the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX)","The mitigation of losses due to extreme climate events and long-term climate adaptation requires climate informed decision-making. In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWX’s core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described. Then, a comprehensive overview of the Viewer, which is a web-based interface used to access EOs, is provided. This includes a description of (i) the maps and associated features to access gridded EO data and anomalies for different temporal averaging periods, (ii) time series graphs and associated features to access EOs aggregated over polygons such as administrative boundaries, and (iii) commonly used EOs served by the EWX that provide assessments of climate and vegetation conditions. Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted. Regional implementation of the EWX facilitates access to regionally focused EOs and their availability at polygon boundaries most relevant to the local decision-makers. Similar instances of EWX implemented in other regions, especially those susceptible to food and water security, will likely further enhance the application of EOs for informed decision-making.","{""Shukla, Shraddhanand""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2020.583509",2024-04-25 02:29:21,"included",NA,2021,"{maybe}","{""USAID|USGS|DARPA|ARO|earth observation|food security|water security|web service|drought|climate serv""}"

Satellite remote sensing offers a unique potential for mapping and monitoring fires at large spatial scales. Active fire information from satellites is one of the fundamental data in mitigating the smoke haze effect; therefore, active fire monitoring has become an essential tool for daily fires and smoke haze control, management, and mitigation in Thailand. The three critical sources of active fire hotspot information used in Thailand and elsewhere include (a) NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS); (b) the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), Active Fire Alert System; and (c) the Colorado School of Mines VIIRS NightFire Alert System. On their own, satellite-derived active fire information is insufficient, but the combination of satellite-derived data and traditional fire monitoring from ground-based methods can work well. Adding advanced geostationary fire detection is needed as a next step to enable fire suppression teams to reach fires as quickly as possible, resulting in much more efficient and safer fire control. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","{""Davies, D."",""Elvidge, C."",""McCarty, J.

6691543,"Valuation of Calibration for Satellite Constellations","Earth observation systems, consisting of in-space and air borne platforms and sensors, are providing a growing number of high resolution spatial and temporal services including agricultural crop yield predictions, local weather forecasts, and traffic management. As the complexity of these systems increases with multi-platform elements and sophisticated processing and modeling, there are also increasing avenues for introduction of errors. It is important to characterize and quantify the uncertainties and errors. Here, it shown that a value-chain approach can be used for conceptualizing errors and modeling uncertainties relevant for final decisions. This approach can then be applied for improving system value assessments and obtaining an ‘error-adjusted’ value of the remote sensing system. The error-adjusted value can be used in optimization or trade-studies for system design. This value system is then applied, as an example, to the FLARE real world calibration/validation system to look at potential Return on Investment (ROI) of better calibration to satellite image prices and market penetration.","{""Siddiqi, Alfreen""}","https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/calcon/CALCON2020/all2020content/30/",2024-04-22 02:58:24,"included",NA,2020,"{}",NA

The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations’ (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users’ needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie). This study represents one viable method to assess the priority of Earth observations from the perspective of users.

6863466,"Development Of A Hydrological Telemetry System In Bago River","Hydrological monitoring is one of the key aspects in early warning systems that are vital to flood disaster management in flood-prone areas such as Bago River Basin in Myanmar. Thousands of people are affected due to the perennial flooding. Owing to the increasing pressure of rapid urbanization in the region and future climate change impacts, an early warning system in the basin is urgently required for disaster risk mitigation. This paper introduces the co-establishment of the telemetry system by a group of stakeholders. The co-establishment of the system through intensive consultations, proactive roles in responsibility sharing, and capacity building efforts, is essential in developing a base platform for flood forecasting and an early warning system in the basin. Herein, we identify the key challenges that have been central to the participatory approach in co-establishing the system. We also highlight opportunities as a result of the ongoing process and future impact on the disaster management system in the basin. We also highlight the potential for scientific contributions in understanding the local weather and hydrological characteristics through the establishment of the high-temporal resolution observation network. Using the observation at Zaung Tu Weir, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite estimates were assessed. Near real-time and standard versions of both satellite estimates show potential utility over the basin. Hourly aggregation shows slightly higher than 40% probability of detection (POD), on average, for both satellite estimates regardless of the production type. Thus, the hourly aggregation requires correction before usage. The results show useful skills at 60% POD for standard GSMaP (GSMAP-ST), 55% POD for near real-time GSMaP (GSMAP-NR), and 46% POD for GPM, at 3-hourly aggregations. Six-hourly aggregations show maximum benefit for providing useful skill and good correspondence to gauge the observation with GSMAP-ST showing the best true skill score (TSS) at 0.54 and an equitable threat score (ETS) at 0.37. While, both final run GPM and GSMAP-NR show lower POD, TSS, and ETS scores. Considering the latency of near real-time satellite estimates, the GSMAP-NR shows the best potential with a 4-hour latency period for monitoring and forecasting purposes in the basin. The result of the GSMAP-NR does not vary significantly from the GSMAP-ST and all GPM estimates. However, it requires some correction before its usage in any applications, for modeling and forecasting purposes. © 2018, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.","{""Acierto, R.

6863583,"Management Recommendation Generation For Areas Under Forest Restoration Process Through Images Obtained By Uav And Lidar","Evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management. However, the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious, and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult. The use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images, combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations, can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas. The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A. (recently acquired by Suzano S.A.), in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers. The most frequent management recommendation was ""weed control + plant seedlings"" (34%) for all evaluated methods. The image monitoring methods suggested by this study proved to be efficient, mainly by reducing the time and cost necessary for field monitoring and increasing the accuracy of the generated management recommendations. © 2019 by the authors.","{""Filho, E.

6691713,"Simulating the value of El Nino forecasts for the Panama Canal","The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canal’s primary storage facility, for operations—principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (July–December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914–1997. Operational capabilities to predict\ntropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment ‘‘virtual’’ canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981–1998. The results show the following main points:\n(i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate.\n(ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies.\n(iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments.\n(iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately $US 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.","{""Graham, Nicholas""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2005.12.005",2024-04-26 18:59:12,"included",NA,2006,"{}","{""El Nino forecasts|Panama Canal management|Forecast uncertainty|Seasonal forecasting|Management under""}"

In recent years, many humanitarian actors have joined forces to complement traditional, reactive mechanisms with a forward-looking approach that can be activated before a disaster strikes. Anticipatory action (AA) uses forecasts of extreme weather events and combines them with risk information to identify and implement locally-led early actions with the goal of protecting lives and livelihoods more efficiently. AA is still a relatively new approach. Hence, monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL) is crucial to measure its effectiveness and adjust where necessary, as well as for (government) donors that want to see the added value of their investment maximized. However, evidence-based studies that investigate potential limitations and the exact impact pathway of AA at household level are time-consuming, costly, and therefore scarce. Satellite earth observation can become a game changer in AA by strengthening the evidence base via rapid, low-cost assessments. Both commercial and freely available satellite-derived data have reached an unprecedented level of quality, spatial, and temporal resolution. Simultaneously, there are major uncertainties regarding where, when, how, and under what conditions satellite data can support MEAL for AA at all. We argue that satellite data for an advanced MEAL framework should be considered already in the design phase of AA projects and that the translation of satellite data into actionable information will require a cross-cutting community of practice.",NA,"10.3389/fclim.2022.923852",2024-09-26 00:46:04,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6863443,"Mapping A Specific Class For Priority Habitats Monitoring From Satellite Sensor Data","The European Union's Habitats Directive aims to protect biodiversity through the conservation of habitats. If a habitat of interest corresponds to spectrally separable land cover class(es), then this activity can benefit from the production of accurate land cover maps from remotely sensed imagery. Traditionally, the image classification techniques used assume that the set of classes has been defined exhaustively, which requires all of the classes in the region to be included explicitly in the analysis. Often, however, interest focuses on just one or a small sub-set of the classes occurring in the region that represent the habitat(s) of particular interest. Moreover, given that the size of a training set required for an image classification is typically taken to be a function of the number of classes and discriminating variables (e. g. wavebands) used in the classification, the satisfaction of the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes requires that much effort is directed wastefully on classes of little, if any, direct interest. Savings in training could be achieved by focusing on the class(es) of specific interest. A more appropriate approach for mapping a specific class may be to adopt a binary classification analysis that simply seeks to separate the class of interest from all others. In this way the analysis focuses on the class(es) of interest and a small training set may be used. An attractive means to achieve this is through the adoption of decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches to classification. This paper evaluates the accuracy with which a habitat of interest to the EU Habitats Directive, fen, can be mapped from Landsat ETM+ imagery of the Norfolk Broads using such classifiers as well as, for comparative purposes, a standard maximum likelihood decision rule implemented by a discriminant analysis. All analyses yielded accurate classifications, with a conventional approach based on a maximum likelihood allocation providing an overall classification accuracy of 88.4\%. However, both the decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches provided classifications that were significantly more accurate than conventional maximum likelihood classification (p < 0.05), with overall accuracies of 91.6 and 93.6\%, respectively (table 3). The results highlight the ability to focus the analysis on the class of interest in a manner that is less wasteful of resources and effort and that yields a more accurate classification than the standard approach.","{""Boyd, Doreen S."",""Foody, Giles M."",""Sanchez-Hernandez, Carolina""}","10.1080/01431160600554348",2024-09-27 23:06:54,"included",NA,2006,"{maybe}",NA
6691541,"Knowledge generation using satellite earth observations to support sustainable development goals (SDG): A use case on Land degradation","Land degradation is a critical issue globally requiring immediate actions for protecting biodiversity and associated services provided by ecosystems that are supporting human quality of life. The latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Landmark Assessment Report highlighted that human activities are considerably degrading land and threating the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion\npeople. In order to reduce and ideally reverse this prevailing situation, national capacities should be strengthened to enable effective assessments and mapping of their degraded lands as recommended by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The indicator 15.3.1 (“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”) requires regular data production by countries to inform and assess it through space and time. Earth\nObservations (EO) can play an important role both for generating the indicator in countries where it is missing, as well complementing or enhancing national official data sources. In response to this issue, this paper presents an innovative, scalable and flexible approach to monitor land degradation at various scales (e.g., national, regional, global) using various components of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) platform to leverage EO resources for informing SDG 15.3.1. The proposed approach follows the Data-Information-Knowledge pattern using the Trends.Earth model (http://trends.earth) and various data sources to generate the indicator. It also implements additional components for model execution and orchestration, knowledge management, and visualization. The proposed approach has been successfully applied at global, regional and national scales and advances the vision of (1) establishing data analytics platforms that can potentially support countries to discover, access and use the necessary datasets to assess land degradation; and (2) developing new capacities to effectively and efficiently use EO-based resources.","{""Giuliani, Gregory""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102068",2024-04-23 22:19:26,"included",NA,2020,"{maybe}","{""Land degradation|Sustainable development goal|knowledge|earth observations|Vlab|GEOSS|Trends.Earth""}"
6691736,"A skill score based on economic value for probability forecasts","An approach to evaluating probability forecasts for dichotomous events, based on their economic value over all possible cost/loss ratio decision problems, is proposed. The resulting Value Score (VS) curve shows non-dimensionalised relative economic value as a function of the cost/loss ratios for different decision-makers, over their full meaningful range. The VS curve is similar in terms of computational mechanics and graphical display to the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, but the ROC curve is shown to be insensitive to either conditional or unconditional biases and thus to reflect potential rather than actual skill. The possibility of collapsing the VS curve into a single scalar score is addressed, and it is shown that the results can depend very strongly on the assumed distribution of cost/loss ratios in the community of forecast users.","{""Wilks, D.S.""}","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1350482701002092",2024-04-26 19:00:19,"included",NA,2001,"{""good general method"",""not applied?""}",NA

6863169,"Diagnosing Irrigation Performance And Water Productivity Through Satellite Remote Sensing And Secondary Data In A Large Irrigation System Of Pakistan","Irrigation policy makers and managers need information on the irrigation performance and productivity of water at various scales to devise appropriate water management strategies, in particular considering dwindling water availability, further threats from climate change, and continually rising population and food demand. In practice it is often difficult to access sufficient water supply and use data to determine crop water consumption and irrigation performance. Energy balance techniques using remote sensing data have been developed by various researchers over the last 20 years, and can be used as a tool to directly estimate actual evapotranspiration, i.e., water consumption. This study demonstrates how remote sensing-based estimates of water consumption and water stress combined with secondary agricultural production data can provide better estimates of irrigation performance, including water productivity, at a variety of scales than alternative options. A principle benefit of the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural performance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner. To demonstrate the advantages, the approach was applied in Rechna Doab irrigation system of Pakistan's Punjab Province. Remote sensing-based indicators reflecting equity, adequacy, reliability and water productivity were estimated. Inter- and intra-irrigation subdivision level variability in irrigation performance, associated factors and improvement possibilities are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the data landscape is changing. With emerging big data and cloud-based services, there are new opportunities for data collection, influencing both official data collection processes and the operation of the programmes they monitor.

6447794,"Assessing the value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs: An example from the Great Barrier Reef","The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reef protection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5–10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.","{""Bouma, Jetske A."",""Dekker, Arnold G."",""Kuik, Onno""}","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.07.023",NA,NA,NA,2011,"{benchmark}","{""Bayesian decision theory"",""Coral reef protection"",""Cost-effectiveness analysis"",""Earth Observation"",""Marine water quality management"",""Value of information""}"
6863497,"Open-Source Processing And Analysis Of Aerial Imagery Acquired With A Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial System To Support Invasive Plant Management","Remote sensing by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is a dynamic evolving technology. UAS are particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management because they have the capability to provide data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, data acquisition costs are lower than those of conventional methods such as extensive ground sampling, manned airplanes, or satellites. Small fixed-wing UAS in particular offer further potential benefits as they extend the operational coverage of the area under study at lower operator risks and accelerate data deployment times. Taking these aspects into account, UAS might be an effective tool to support management of invasive plant based on early detection and regular monitoring. A straightforward UAS approach to map invasive plant species is presented in this study with the intention of providing ready-to-use field maps essential for action-oriented management. Our UAS utilizes low-cost sensors, free-of-charge software for mission planning and an affordable, commercial aerial platform to reduce operational costs, reducing expenses with personnel while increasing overall efficiency. We illustrate our approach using a real example of invasion by Acacia mangium in a Brazilian Savanna ecosystem. A. mangium was correctly identified with an overall accuracy of 82.7\% from the analysis of imagery. This approach provides land management authorities and practitioners with new prospects for environmental restoration in areas where invasive plant species are present.","{""Buttschardt, Tillmann K."",""Heringer, Gustavo"",""Lehmann, Jan R.

6863602,"Satellite-Based Crop Production Monitoring In Ukraine And Regional Food Security","Every year weather vagaries have caused shortfalls of agricultural production regionally and every 3-4 years these shortfalls occurred globally. Therefore, early assessment of crop losses in response to weather fluctuations is an important task for the estimation of global, regional and countries food supply/demand, donor's decision to assists the nations in need and to those receiving the assistance. The new satellite-based technology has been recently developed to provide timely and accurate crops' monitoring and assessments. This technology includes the theory, algorithm, data base and operational implementation of vegetation health (VH) assessments from observations provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on NOAA operational polar-orbiting satellites. Several AVHRR-based VH indices were developed and used to provide weekly cumulative estimation of moisture, thermal and health conditions of vegetation canopy throughout the growing season. The indices were calculated for the entire 1981-2010 period of the AVHRR sensor in space and were compared with regional crop yields in the two dozens of countries. Strong correlation between wheat (both winter and spring), corn, soybeans and sorghum yield and VH indices was found during the critical period of the tested crops. The test results showed that VH indices can be used as proxy for early (2-5 months in advance of harvest) assessment of crop yield with the errors of estimation less than 10%.

6903640,"Integrating Detailed Timber Assortments Into Airborne Laser Scanning (Als)-Based Assessments Of Logging Recoveries","The methodology presented here can assist in making timber markets more efficient when assessing the value of harvestable timber stands and the amounts of timber assortments during the planning of harvesting operations. Information on wood quality and timber assortments is essential for wood valuation and procurement planning as varying wood dimensions and qualities may be utilized and refined in different places, including sawmills, plywood mills, pulp mills, heating plants or combined heat and power plants. We investigate here alternative approaches for generating detailed timber assortments for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula spp.) from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial images, harvester data and field data. For this purpose, we used 665 circular plots, and logging recovery information recorded from 249 clear-cut stands using cut-to-length harvesters. We estimated timber assortment volumes, economic values and wood paying capabilities (WPC) for each stand in different bucking scenarios, and used the resulting timber assortment estimates to assess logging recoveries. The bucking scenarios were (1) bucking-to-value using maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality (theoretical maximum), and (2) bucking-to-value using sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals for Norway spruce and Scots pine and veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m for birch, either excluding quality (the usual business practice) or including quality (a novel business practice). The results showed that our procedure can assist in locating stands that are likely to be more valuable and have the desired timber assortment distributions. We conclude that the method can estimate WPC with root mean square errors of 28.7\%, 66.0\% and 45.7\% in Norway spruce, Scots pine and birch, respectively, for sawlogs and 19.3\%, 63.7\% and 29.5\% for pulpwood.",NA,"10.3390/f12091221",2024-09-30 21:37:15,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6447792,"Utilizing Satellite Earth Observation Analyses and the Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology  Modelling Framework to Support the Yurok Tribe in Mitigating Climate Change Impacts through Natural  Resource Management","The Yurok Tribe is engaging in innovative conservation-based natural resource management to confront the impacts of climate change both on and off the Yurok Ancestral Territory. These indigenous-led efforts focus on protecting community safety and the natural forest, land, and river resources that are connected to their lifeways, economies and culture. However, decisions around the implementation of these efforts are challenging. Challenges include intersecting environmental and socioeconomic factors, understanding complex environmental trends, and a diverse network of stakeholders. This project aids the Nation-Building efforts of the Tribe by supplementing tribal decisionmaking as they develop solutions to mitigate climate impacts, reduce the rate of climate change, and balance resilience, revenue, and cultural values in natural resource management. To supplement Yurok decisionmakers and staff actions, a Decision Support System (DSS) is being developed as a collaborative project by the Tribe and the authors. The DSS incorporates satellite earth observation (EO) analyses and employs the Environment-VulnerabilityDecision-Technology (EVDT) modelling framework. The DSS considers the interactions between the environment, human vulnerability, decision-making and technology design. This work discusses the development of the EO analyses for this DSS. Regarding the environmental component of EVDT, tree cover is analysed towards understanding fire risk and forest trends with respect to different land management strategies. This analysis also relates to the human vulnerability component of EVDT, as it is integrated in the DSS with local socioeconomic data on the wildland-urban interface (to protect public safety) and Tribal Carbon Sequestration projects (to protect the carbon sequestered in these forests). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) mean anomaly is utilized to examine sustained tree cover change. Also, regarding human vulnerability, existing EO products on forest fire alerts and smoke are integrated with local socioeconomic information in the DSS towards minimizing these climaterelated impacts on Yurok communities. Additionally, analyses of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) space-based LiDAR data are utilized to provide information on forest structure change. This information is related to the decision-making component of EVDT, as it is employed by Yurok staff and decisionmakers in carbon sequestration initiatives and the Tribe’s natural resources portfolio project planning. These carbon sequestration projects provide the Tribe with meaningful revenues and seek to reduce the rate of climate change impacts. These analyses will be supplemented by aerial LiDAR data collection and further technological advances coupled with scientific and traditional ecological knowledge which is being explored by the Tribe. Future work will include EO analyses of tree species distribution to understand invasive conifer encroachment, forestry strategic actions, prairie restoration, wildlife protection and riparian vegetation on the Klamath and Trinity rivers to mitigate salmon depletion and aid in river restoration.","{""Israel, Dr. Steven"",""Kinney, Javier"",""Lombardo, Seamus"",""Wood, Prof. Danielle""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2022,"{benchmark}",NA
6862735,"The Value Of Remotely Sensed Vs. Field-Surveyed Habitat Structure For Predicting Bird Abundance: A Case Study In Traditional Orchards","Understanding environmental effects on the distribution and abundance of species is central to ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology. This led to the development of species distribution models (SDMs) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables. So far, SDMs rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determinant of bird distributions. While remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys. In this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance. Specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in South-Western Germany. 'Remote sensing SDMs' related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees. Alternative 'field survey SDMs' related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees. Additionally, both remote sensing and field survey SDMs included climate and land use variables. Accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use. The impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species. The remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abundance of seven species. In contrast, multiple field-surveyed variables had similar effect strength, with the overall strongest effect found for pear tree density, to which seven bird species showed a unimodal response. These analyses have conservation implications since they predict expected responses of bird species to ongoing changes in orchard structure. Moreover, they identify structural variables that will be most promising to measure via remote sensing data in the future.","{""Chaparro, Laura"",""Schmieder, Klaus"",""Schurr, Frank M.""}","10.1007/s10336-022-01970-9",2024-07-16 23:56:48,"included",NA,2022,"{}","{""Biodiversity conservation; Fine-scale vegetation structure; Habitat structure; Population density; R""}"
6863236,"Spectral Matching Based On Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization: A New Method For Terrestrial Water Body Extraction Using Multi-Temporal Landsat 8 Images","Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management.","{""Jia, Kai"",""Jiang, Weiguo"",""Li, Jing"",""Tang, Zhenghong""}","10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.012",2024-07-18 22:03:31,"included",NA,2018,"{}","{""Discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO); Flood inundation mapping; Landsat 8 Operational Land Im""}"

To help track these changes, our planet has been under continuous observation from satellites since 1972. Currently, petabytes of satellite Earth observation (EO) data are freely available. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized because many big data challenges and complexity barriers hinder their effective use. Consequently, facilitating the production of EVs using the wealth of satellite EO data can be beneficial for environmental monitoring systems. In response to this issue, a comprehensive list of EVs that can take advantage of consistent time-series satellite data has been derived.

6863640,"A Hybrid Kernel-Based Change Detection Method For Remotely Sensed Data In A Similarity Space","Detection of damages caused by natural disasters is a delicate and difficult task due to the time constraints imposed by emergency situations. Therefore, an automatic Change Detection (CD) algorithm, with less user interaction, is always very interesting and helpful. So far, there is no existing CD approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) multi-temporal images being corrupted by either noise or non-normalized radiometric differences; (c) difference images having overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other. Also, a low degree of automation is not optimal for real-time CD applications and also one-dimensional representations of classical CD methods hide the useful information in multi-temporal images. In order to resolve these problems, two automatic kernel-based CD algorithms (KCD) were proposed based on kernel clustering and support vector data description (SVDD) algorithms in high dimensional Hilbert space. In this paper (a) a new similarity space was proposed in order to increase the separation between change and no-change classes, and also to decrease the processing time, (b) three kernel-based approaches were proposed for transferring the multi-temporal images from spectral space into high dimensional Hilbert space, (c) automatic approach was proposed to extract the precise labeled samples; (d) kernel parameter w a s selected automatically by optimizing an improved cost function and (e) initial value of the kernel parameter was estimated by a statistical method based on the L2-norm distance. Two different datasets including Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were used for the accuracy of analysis of proposed methods. The comparative analysis showed the accuracy improvements of kernel clustering based CD and SVDD based CD methods with respect to the conventional CD techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction, Independent Component Analysis, Spectral Angle Mapper, Simple Image differencing and Image Rationing, and also the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of the proposed CD method in similarity space decreases the processing runtime. © 2015 by the authors.","{""Homayouni, S."",""Safari, A."",""Shah-Hosseini, R.""}","10.3390/rs71012829",2024-09-30 21:32:09,"included",NA,2015,"{maybe}","{Clustering,""Clustering algorithms"",""Cost benefit analysis"",""Cost functions"",""Damage detection"",""Data description"",Disasters,""Hilbert space"",""Hilbert spaces"",""Image analysis"",""Image enhancement"",""Independent component analysis"",""Kernel-based CD"",""One dimensional"",""One-class classifier"",""One-class classifiers"",""Quantum optics"",""Remote sensing"",""Remotely sensed data"",""Similarity space"",""Similarity spaces"",""Trees (mathematics)"",""Vector spaces""}"
6862950,"Determining The Optimal Phenological Stage For Predicting Common Dry Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris) Yield Using Field Spectroscopy","On-farm crop productivity and yield prediction are valuable for, among others, designing food policies, on-farm and after-farm planning and pricing, and marketing. Whereas existing prediction approaches are generally reliable, these require extensive and tedious field surveys and adequate ancillary agrometeorological data. Remote sensing offers great potential for quick and reliable means of predicting crop yield, but it necessitates establishment of optimal phenological and spectral bands. Given the socio-economic value of common dry bean, we sought to determine the potential of multi-temporal ground-based hyperspectral data to predict yield of three cultivars grown under irrigated and rain-fed regimes. Canopy-level hyperspectral data were collected from the Gadra, Ukulinga and Caledon cultivars at distinct phenological stages and sparse partial least squares regression was used for spectral analysis. Results indicated that variation in yield could be explained at specific growth stages under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. With the exception of the Gadra cultivar under irrigation, models developed with data at the flowering and pod development stage were more accurate. These findings highlight the potential of temporal phenological ground-based hyperspectral data in predicting common dry bean yield under different watering regimes.

6863116,"Avhrr Data For Real-Time Operational Flood Forecasting In Malaysia","Flash floods strike quickly and in most cases without warning. They are usually observed before any warning can be issued and usually persons and property have been affected before the warning reaches them. Such are the conditions prevalent in Malaysia's extreme monsoon weather that occasionally causes floods and results in the extensive damage to property and sometimes loss of lives. Over the years variously hydrological and structural engineering measures have been implemented for flood monitoring and forecasting. These measures have only yielded limited success as may be seen in the recurring flood situation. Yearly financial and property loss estimates have increased and an estimated cost of over 2.5 billion RM is projected for the year 2004 according to sources from the drainage and irrigation department of Malaysia. It has thus become apparent that Malaysia institutes an effective operational flood forecasting to arrest the persisting flood problem. In this paper we will expound on current flood management and forecasting system being implemented in the country, particularly the Klang Valley that includes Kuala Lumpur where there has been tremendous urban growth and development in the last one and half decades. The paper further discusses where current flood management systems have been lacking in the absence of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts. Where as hydrodynamic simulations and structural control measures have been emphasized in many flood management systems in Malaysia, the integration of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts have been conspicuously absent, rendering most in-situ flood forecasts and early warnings ineffective in address the flood problem in the country. Malaysia is a tropical country that lies along the path of the northeast and southwest monsoon. Although satellite image based NWP have proved useful for the tropical and equatorial regions of the world in flood forecasting, they have yet to be applied in Malaysia. Observations have generally shown heavy cumulonimbus clouds formation and thunderstorms precede the usual heavy monsoon rains that cause floods in the region. This makes quantitative precipitation forecast a must be input to any flood early warning design. Numerous empirical studies have determined that cloud top temperatures less that 235k in the tropics are generally expected to produce convective rainfall at the rate of 3mm/hr. In this study we thus investigate monsoon cloud formation that has the propensity to precipitate using NOAA-AVHRR data for real-time operational flood early warning in Malaysia. The AVHRR data has been preferred for its relatively high temporal resolution of at most 6/hours, its easy acquisition and cost effectiveness and its ability for automated geometric rectification when compared to GEOS and GMS data. Cloud cover and types are processed using cloud indexing and pattern recognition techniques on the AVHRR data. The cloud indexing technique was initially developed for NOAA but was later also adapted for Geostationary satellite images. The technique assigns rainfall levels to each cloud type identifies in an image based on the relationship between cold and bright clouds top temperature and the high probability of precipitation. We discuss how visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) techniques are applied to bi-spectral cloud classification and rain areas are determined by classifying pixel clusters in the VIS/IR histogram. Precipitation probability is evaluated based on the relationship between cold and brightness temperature of clouds. The near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) channels 3, 4, and 5 of the data are processed for temperature and brightness.

6903656,"Estimating District-Level Electricity Consumption Using Remotely Sensed Data In Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand","The intensive industrial development in special economic zones, such as Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, increases energy consumption, leading to an imbalance of energy supply and a challenge for energy management. Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2. The local government in developing countries with limited data and financial resources can adopt the proposed approach to benefit from utilizing commonly available remote sensing and statistical data with simple machine learning models such as DT (regression method) for sustainable electricity management.",NA,"10.3390/rs13224654",2024-09-26 00:57:11,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA

Our study is motivated by the continuing debate among policymakers over the value of the nation’s investment in Earth observations. We also consider the role of related factors including the spread of geographical information systems (GIS; a complementary tool for using Earth observations data) and the role of data prices. We first estimate a diffusion curve and then draw from standard bibliometric methods to evaluate further the extent to which the research field is growing.

We find evidence of increasingly widespread use of Earth observations in an ever-widening number of applications and geographic regions. GIS and data prices influence this diffusion.

6863293,"Dynamic Partitioning Of Tropical Indian Ocean Surface Waters Using Ocean Colour Data - Management And Modelling Applications","Over the past few decades, partitioning of the surface ocean into ecologically-meaningful spatial domains has been approached using a range of data types, with the aim of improving our understanding of open ocean processes, supporting marine management decisions and constraining coupled ocean-biogeochemical models. The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, alpha = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north-south gradient (PERMANOVA, alpha = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO(2) with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources - from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025\%a(-1) for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, alpha = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification. The optical partitioning scheme described here can be applied in Google Earth Engine to support management decisions at daily or monthly scales, and potential applications are discussed.","{""Schwarz, Jill N.""}","10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111308",2024-07-18 21:10:04,"included",NA,2020,"{maybe}","{""Remote sensing; Biogeography; Habitat fragmentation; Multi-sensor; Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OC""}"
6863329,"Assessing The Role Of Climate And Resource Management On Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem Changes In Arid Environments With The Landsat Archive","Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies. This work is supporting land and water managers for evaluation of GDEs with respect to climate, groundwater, and resource management. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

6863089,"Revisiting The Environmental Kuznets Curve For City-Level Co2 Emissions: Based On Corrected Npp-Viirs Nighttime Light Data In China","With the increasing trend of global warming, the Chinese government faces tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R-2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers. This study could be considered the first to simulate CO2 emissions at the provincial and city levels in China based on a NPP-VIIRS nighttime light model to explore the associated geographical distribution characteristics and potential influencing factors.

6691745,"Estimating the Social Value of Geologic Map Information: A Regulatory Application","People frequently regard the landscape as part of a static system. The mountains and rivers that cross the landscape, and the bedrock that supports the surface, change little during the course of a lifetime. Society can alter the geologic history of an area and, in so doing, affect the occurrence and impact of environmental hazards. For example, changes in land use can induce changes in erosion, sedimentation, and ground-water supply. As the environmental system is changed by both natural processes and human activities, the system’s capacity to respond to additional stresses also changes. Information such as geologic maps describes the physical world and is critical for identifying solutions to land use and environmental issues. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the economic value of applying geologic map information to siting a waste disposal facility. An improvement in geologic map information is shown to have a net positive value to society. Such maps enable planners to make superior land management decisions.","{""Bernkopf, Richard""}","https://doi.org/10.1006/jeem.1996.0963",2024-04-23 22:37:45,"included",NA,1997,"{}",NA
6863387,"Assessment Of The Utility Of Remote Sensing Techniques For Monitoring Compliance With Direct Payment Programs","The public-interest direct payment program involves providing direct payments to agricultural producers and rural residents through public funds, premised on performing public functions such as environmental conservation, stable food supply, and maintaining rural communities via agricultural activities. Scientific estimation of crop cultivation areas and production levels is crucial for formulating agricultural policies linked to regulating food supply, which increasingly impacts the national economy. Conducting comprehensive on-site inspections for compliance monitoring of direct payment programs has shown very low efficiency in relation to budget and time. The expansion of areas subject to compliance monitoring and various challenges in on-site inspections necessitate streamlining current monitoring methods and devising effective strategies. As a solution, the application of Remote Sensing technology and spatial information utilization, allowing swift acquisition of necessary information for policies without overall on-site visits, is being discussed as an efficient compliance monitoring method. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential use of remote sensing for improving operational efficiency in monitoring compliance with public-interest direct payment programs. Using satellite images during farming seasons in Gimje and Hapcheon, vegetation indices and spatial variations were utilized to identify cultivated areas, presence of mixed crops, validated against on-site inspection data.

(MWFP) Forest Management Agreement, the company has the right to harvest trees, grow trees, manage the forest and plan activities that assure forest productivity and industry profitability without jeopardizing the quality of the environment. Thus, as part of obtaining provincial government approval, the company has to submit a Detailed Forest Management Plan that includes a comprehensive assessment of the environmental implications of forestry operations and the mitigation of impacts. Forest management planning for environmental sustainability will become more and more difficult with increased land use pressures from other industries, agriculture and recreation. Therefore, the planning process will require increasingly more sophisticated modelling tools to identify and avoid significant impacts. The Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project proposes a hybrid modelling tool that relies on inexpensive remote sensing data, with few ground truthing requirements, to model streamflow, suspended solids and nutrients in streams on the Boreal Plain. Incorporating modelling tools into the MWFP planning process provides MWFP additional strategies to operate in an environmentally sensitive manner.

Although new monitoring tools are emerging, their specific advantages should be identified to optimise their simultaneous use. Based on the goodness-of-fit of linear models, we compared the potential of passive acoustics and environmental data for predicting the structure of coral reef fish assemblages in different environmental and biogeographic settings. Both data types complemented each other. Globally, the acoustic data showed relatively low added value in predicting fish assemblage structures. The predictions were best for the distribution of fish abundance among functional entities (i.e., proxies for fish functional groups, grouping species that share similar eco-morphological traits), for the simplest functional entities (i.e., combining two eco-morphological traits), and when considering diet and the level in the water column of the species. Our study demonstrates that Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) improves fish assemblage assessment when used in tandem with environmental data compared to using environmental data alone.

Millions of these are surface plastic land mines with low-pressure detonation regimes, such as the mass-produced Soviet PFM-1. These aerially deployed land mines are concentrated primarily in postconflict developing countries such as Afghanistan and represent a continued humanitarian threat, while also thwarting economic and social development in impacted regions. Identification of this particular type of MEC category poses a significant geophysical challenge, as these mines contain almost no metal (nonferrous aluminum). As a result, standard MEC detection and remediation methodologies based on geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic induction prove largely ineffective and possibly dangerous. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles can rapidly collect large remotely sensed data sets with no risk to MEC technicians.

Using two case studies from Malawi, inductive and deductive approaches to land-use/landcover monitoring illustrate the utility of linking geomatics and social analysis as complementary tools. While both studies integrate geomatics with community-based social analysis, the starting point for each is different. The first case study begins by identifying where environmental change is occurring without preconceived hypotheses of causes. The use of geomatics in this case guides the researchers in determining where to conduct more in-depth analysis of explanations of change. The second case study begins with an environmental policy question - ""What has been the effect of market liberalization on the environment?"" - and then uses remote sensing to evaluate a set of hypotheses. This is the deductive approach. Regardless of the starting point, integrating geomatics and social analysis can promote a cycle of inductive and deductive research.

As a collective response, sections of the hydrologic community have recently forged partnerships for the development of space-borne missions for cost-effective, yet global, hydrologic measurements by building upon the technological advancements since the last two decades. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art on flood monitoring in medium and large ungauged basins where satellite remote sensing can facilitate development of a cost-effective mechanism. We present our review in the context of the current hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in flood-prone developing nations situated in international river basins (IRBs). Given the large number of such basins and the difficulty in acquisition of multi-faceted geophysical data, we argue that the conventional data-intensive implementation of physically based hydrologic models that are complex and distributed is time-consuming for global assessment of the utility of proposed global satellite hydrologic missions. A more parsimonious approach is justified at the tolerable expense of accuracy before such missions begin operation. Such a parsimonious approach can subsequently motivate the identified international basins to invest greater effort in conventional and detailed hydrologic studies to design a prototype flood forecasting system in an effort to overcome the hydro-political hurdles to flood monitoring. Through a modeling exercise involving an open-book watershed concept, we demonstrate the value of a parsimonious approach in understanding the utility of NASA-derived satellite rainfall products. It is critical now that real-world operational flood forecasting agencies in the under-developed world come forward to collaborate with the research community in order to leverage satellite rainfall data for greater societal benefit for inhabitants in IRBs.","{""Hong, Yang"",""Hossain, Faisal"",""Katiyar, Nitin"",""Wolf, Aaron""}","10.1007/s11069-006-9094-x",2024-07-16 23:47:41,"included",NA,2007,"{}","{""flood monitoring; satellite remote sensing; precipitation; international river basins; forecasting; ""}"
6691547,"Assessing the full effects of public investment in space","Many space-related impact studies have been carried out in the past, but there is no conclusive, comprehensive evaluation of the economic and social effects of public investments in space. Such evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in official statistics; social benefits, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts from R&D are complex and occur in the long term. However, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts. The full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a ""bottom-up"" and a ""top-down"" perspective. In the bottom-up perspective, each effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the effects. Although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields both detailed and integrated results. Our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts. Next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identified, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies. Finally, suggestions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard. The core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost benefit analysis. Effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values. For effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion. Our core recommendations are to clearly define the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies. Social, strategic and environmental impacts deserve special attention, aiming at a more comprehensive coverage of impacts.

6903568,"Do Big Unstructured Biodiversity Data Mean More Knowledge?","Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of ""big unstructured data"" for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on ""big data."" Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritize data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs. standardized data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: (1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardized long-termspecies population studies; (2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and (3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2018.00239",2024-09-26 01:00:35,"included",NA,NA,"{interesting,maybe}",NA
6863347,"Competition And Burn Severity Determine Post-Fire Sapling Recovery In A Nationally Protected Boreal Forest Of China: An Analysis From Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery","Anticipating how boreal forest landscapes will change in response to changing fire regime requires disentangling the effects of various spatial controls on the recovery process of tree saplings. Spatially explicit monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery through moderate resolution Landsat imagery is a popular technique but is filled with ambiguous information due to mixed pixel effects. On the other hand, very-high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery accurately measures crown size of tree saplings but has gained little attention and its utility for estimating leaf area index (LAI, m2/m2) and tree sapling abundance (TSA, seedlings/ha) in post-fire landscape remains untested. We compared the explanatory power of 30 m Landsat satellite imagery with 0.5-m WorldView-2 VHR imagery for LAI and TSA based on field sampling data, and subsequently mapped the distribution of LAI and TSA based on the most predictive relationships. A random forest (RF) model was applied to assess the relative importance and causal mechanisms of spatial controls on tree sapling recovery. The results showed that pixel percentage of canopy trees (PPCT) derived from VHR imagery outperform all Landsat-derived spectral indices for explaining variance of LAI (R2VHR = 0.676 vs. R2Landsat = 0.427) and TSA (R2VHR = 0.508 vs. R2Landsat = 0.499). The RF model explained an average of 55.5% (SD = 3.0%, MSE = 0.382, N = 50) of the variation of estimated LAI. Understory vegetation coverage (competition) and post-fire surviving mature trees (seed sources) were the most important spatial controls for LAI recovery, followed by burn severity (legacy effect), topographic factors (environmental filter) and nearest distance to unburned area (edge effect). These analyses allow us to conclude that in our study area, mitigating wildfire severity and size may increase forest resilience to wildfire damage. Given the easily-damaged seed banks and relatively short seed dispersal distance of coniferous trees, reasonable human help to natural recovery of coniferous forests is necessary for severe burns with a large patch size, particularly in certain areas. Our research shows the VHR WorldView-2 imagery better resolves key characteristics of forest landscapes like LAI and TSA than Landsat imagery, providing a valuable tool for land managers and researchers alike. © 2019 by the authors.

6863566,"Demonstration Of A Modular Prototype End-To-End Simulator For Aquatic Remote Sensing Applications","This study introduces a prototype end-to-end Simulator software tool for simulating two-dimensional satellite multispectral imagery for a variety of satellite instrument models in aquatic environments. Using case studies, the impact of variable sensor configurations on the performance of value-added products for challenging applications, such as coral reefs and cyanobacterial algal blooms, is assessed. This demonstrates how decisions regarding satellite sensor design, driven by cost constraints, directly influence the quality of value-added remote sensing products. Furthermore, the Simulator is used to identify situations where retrieval algorithms require further parameterization before application to unsimulated satellite data, where error sources cannot always be identified or isolated. The application of the Simulator can verify whether a given instrument design meets the performance requirements of end-users before build and launch, critically allowing for the justification of the cost and specifications for planned and future sensors. It is hoped that the Simulator will enable engineers and scientists to understand important design trade-offs in phase 0/A studies easily, quickly, reliably, and accurately in future Earth observation satellites and systems. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Anstee, J."",""Antoine, D."",""Dekker, A."",""Drayson, N."",""Gensemer, S."",""Matthews, M.

Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of theSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction.

6691521,"Enhancing Access and Usage of Earth Observations in Environmental Decision-Making in Eastern and Southern Africa Through Capacity Building","Major strides have been made in the development of remote sensing, reanalysis, and model-based earth observations (EOs), which can be used for long-term climate variability mapping, as well as real-time environmental monitoring and forecasting. Such EOs are particularly valuable for environmental decision-making (e.g., for environmental resources management and disaster mitigation) in the Eastern and Southern Africa (E & SA) region, where ground-based EOs are sparse. Nonetheless, operational application of those EOs to inform decision-making in the region remains limited. This paper reports on a recently concluded (as of June 2019) NASA SERVIR-supported Applied Science Team project that contributed to the uptake of EO applications to inform decision-making in this region. This project was conducted in close collaboration with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)—the NASA SERVIR regional hub in E & SA. The capacity-building efforts leveraged RCMRD’s existing environmental service capacity, their long experience in capacity building in the region, and their extensive network of regional partners, with the goal of increasing RCMRD and their regional partners’ ability to uptake EOs to enhance their environmental services and, hence, improve the environmental decision-making process. The project focused on: (1) Transfer of technology—Transition and implementation of web-based tools to RCMRD to allow easy processing and visualization of EOs and (2) Capacity training—training of representatives from regional and national environmental service agencies in EO application based on targeted case studies. Here, we describe these capacity-building efforts, provide specific examples to demonstrate the benefits of those efforts in terms of enhanced uptake of EOs, and provide recommendations for furthering the uptake of EOs in the region and beyond.","{""Shukla, Shraddhanand""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.504063",2024-04-22 02:29:41,"included",NA,2021,"{}","{""earth observation|capacity building|Eastern Africa|Southern Africa|environmental services|decision-m""}"
6903583,"Index-Based Insurance For Climate Risk Management And Rural Development In Syria","Improving the adaptive capacity of rural producers to climate and weather risks may become an urgent issue in the early stages of political stabilization in Syria. Therefore, this study analyses the agro-ecological, economic and social benefits of - and the institutional challenges to - establishing index-based insurance markets to catalyse rural development in Syria. The paper examines the potential of three index insurance schemes for minimizing risk: (1) a statistical index, (2) an index based on agro-meteorological approach and (3) a remote sensing-based index. It also discusses how index-based insurance markets contribute to rural development in scenarios of increasing climate risks. The study identifies that all three insurance schemes have a very high potential to cope with increasing climate risk. Insurance schemes designed according to these indexes performed very well in terms of covering revenue losses in most of the extreme drought years observed in the country. Farmers purchasing an insurance contract may have better access to credit and find it easier to invest in agricultural production and improve productivity. Because such alternative index-based insurance programmes are low cost, they are more affordable for poor farmers and thus can potentially make an excellent contribution to economic growth in rural areas.",NA,"10.1080/17565529.2013.844676",2024-10-01 17:29:26,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA

This paper demonstrates a method that can value Landsat and other imagery to users. A survey of downloaders of Landsat images found: (a) established US users have a mean value of $912 USD per scene; (b) new US users and users returning when imagery became free have a mean value of $367 USD per scene. Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery.

6863341,"National Forest Carbon Inventories: Policy Needs And Assessment Capacity","Previous research has identified the importance of the role of land cover in the global carbon cycle. In particular, forests have been identified as a significant carbon sink that can mitigate the rate of global climate change. Policy makers are faced with complex and difficult challenges in getting timely and useful information in monitoring global forest resources. Recent advances in the tools and methods of forest carbon accounting have produced new, innovative approaches to forest-based carbon inventories. But it is important as new tools are developed that scientists understand the needs of policy makers and that policy makers understand the capabilities and limitations of forest inventory methods. This paper explores four different policy applications that rely, or could benefit from, national carbon inventories. The goal is to help build a bridge between the communities of climate policy makers and scientists specialized in forest carbon inventories. To this end, we pursue three specific objectives: First we provide an overview for policy makers about approaches to forest carbon inventories, paying particular attention to the contributions of remote sensing technologies. Second, we outline the issues particularly relevant to forest inventory scientists who are interested in responding to public policy needs. We then discuss the tradeoffs between information cost, accuracy, precision, transparency and timeliness that need to be balanced in long-term monitoring of forest carbon. Finally, the article concludes with a series of observations and recommendations for the implementation of forest carbon inventories as increasingly central components of global climate change policy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","{""Andersson, K."",""Evans, T.

6862795,"Remote Sensing Of Soil And Water Quality In Agroecosystems","Mismanagement of soil and water resources may not only contribute to an escalation of global poverty but also jeopardize ecosystem services, with significant costs to the environment. Although not concentrated within one geographic location (3,500 million hectares), an equivalent of approximately 24 % of the earth's land surface is degraded land, and about 2 billion people (one third of the global population) lack access to safe and affordable water for domestic purposes. It is therefore critical to develop strategies targeted at the root causes of these problems. However, to do so would require a rapid and reliable information system that has been elusive because of the complexity of the environment and the limitations of the existing tools. The increased availability and development of remote sensing and geographic data analysis tools have opened up new possibilities for exploring and monitoring environmental variables influencing key land use and soil management options.

6903604,"Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Prediction And Satellite Data For Forecasting Us Maize Yield","Seasonal agricultural production forecasting is essential for agricultural supply chain and economic prediction. However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble. (3) Using the ""T + P + VPD + EVI"" model with climate prediction from bias-corrected climate prediction from CFSv2 outperformed the yield forecast in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates reports released by the United States Department of Agriculture, with root-mean-square error of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79\% of multiyear averaged yield) by early August. Plain Language Summary Given the significant advances in both seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing, these data have not been fully used in crop yield forecasting at regional scale, and their benefits are to be quantified compared to survey-based approaches. Here we evaluated the benefits of using seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing data in forecasting U.S. maize yield at both national and county levels. To achieve this goal, we built a seasonal forecasting system for U.S. maize yield by bridging the most advanced seasonal climate prediction products from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) with a statistical crop modeling framework. We found we could not achieve a better forecasting performance than the official survey-based forecast from United States Department of Agriculture until we used both climate and remote sensing observations in our model. Compared with using historical climate information for the unknown future in each growing season, using climate prediction from NCEP gave better forecasting performance once we corrected the bias in the seasonal climate prediction products. Using our climate-remote sensing combined model and bias-corrected climate prediction from NCEP, we achieved a better forecasting performance than the United States Department of Agriculture forecast.

The aim was to understand the spatio-temporal behaviour of subfield areas identified by the K-means algorithm from NDVI maps obtained from satellite images and the ground yield data variability to increase the efficiency of delimiting management zones in an organic farming system. Experiments were conducted on a surface of 29 ha. NDVI time series derived from Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithm for rapidly delineating the sunflower subfield areas were used. The crop achene yields in the whole field ranged from 1.3 to 3.77 t ha-1 with a significant within-field spatial variability. The cluster analysis of hand-sampled data showed three subfields with achene yield mean values of 3.54 t ha-1 (cluster 1), 2.98 t ha-1 (cluster 2), and 2.07 t ha-1 (Cluster 3). In the cluster analysis of NDVI data, the k-means algorithm has early delineated the subfield crop spatial and temporal yield variability. The best period for identifying subfield areas starts from the inflorescences development stage to the development of the fruit stage. Analyzing the NDVI subfield areas and yield data, it was found that cluster 1 covers an area of 42.4\% of the total surface and 50\% of the total achene yield; cluster 2 covers 35\% of both surface and yield. Instead, the surface of cluster 3 covers 22.2\% of the total surface with 15\% of achene yield. K-means algorithm derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI images delineates the sunflower subfield areas. Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithms can improve an efficient assessment of subfield areas in sunflower crops. Identifying subfield areas can lead to site-specific long-term agronomic actions for improving the sustainable intensification of agriculture in the organic farming system.","{""Marino, Stefano""}","10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19507",2024-07-18 23:30:12,"included",NA,2023,"{maybe}","{""Yield; Cluster analysis; K -means; Remote sensing; Semi -automatic classification""}"

Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.","{""Zaitchik, Benjamin""}","https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JHM951.1",2024-04-26 19:06:40,"included",NA,2008,"{}","{""Land surface model|Rivers|Satellite observations|Data assimilation|Kalman filters|Hydrologic models""}"

It can enable both experts and citizen scientists to co-create new knowledge. Better understanding of local environmental, social, and geographical contexts can help in designing appropriate plans for sustainable development. However, a lack of geospatial data, especially in the context of developing countries, often precludes context-specific development planning. This study therefore tests an innovative approach of volunteer citizen science and an open mapping platform to build resilience to natural hazards in the remote mountainous parts of western Nepal. In this study, citizen scientists and mapping experts jointly mapped two districts of Nepal (Bajhang and Bajura) using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. Remote mapping based on satellite imagery, capacity building, and mobilization of citizen scientists was performed to collect the data. These data were then uploaded to OSM and later retrieved in ArcGIS to produce a usable map that could be exploited as a reference resource for evidence-based decision-making. The collected data are freely accessible to community members as well as government and humanitarian actors, and can be used for development planning and risk reduction. By piloting in two communities of western Nepal, we found that using open data platforms for collecting and analyzing location-based data has a mutual benefit for researchers and communities. Such data could be vital in understanding the local landscape, environmental risk, and distribution of resources.

We created land use regression (LUR) models for SO2, NO2 and PM10 for Tianjin, China. Traffic volumes, road networks, land use data, population density, meteorological conditions, physical conditions and satellite-derived greenness, brightness and wetness were used for predicting SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. We incorporated data on industrial point sources to improve LUR model performance. In order to consider the impact of different sources, we calculated the PSIndex, LSIndex and area of different land use types (agricultural land, industrial land, commercial land, residential land, green space and water area) within different buffer radii (1 to 20 km). This method makes up for the lack of consideration of source impact based on the LUR model. Remote sensing-derived variables were significantly correlated with gaseous pollutant concentrations such as SO2 and NO2. R-2 values of the multiple linear regression equations for SO2, NO2 and PM10 were 0.78, 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, and the RMSE values were 0.32, 0.18 and 0.21, respectively. Model predictions at validation monitoring sites went well with predictions generally within 15\% of measured values. Compared to the relationship between dependent variables and simple variables (such as traffic variables or meteorological condition variables), the relationship between dependent variables and integrated variables was more consistent with a linear relationship.

The valuation of government-owned satellite systems providing a public good with a complex array of instruments is a nascent field of study. Many different sensor configurations are possible, but there are restrictions due to physical and budget constraints. Accounting for economic considerations during the design and planning phase for satellite constellations helps to ensure that the most cost effective instruments are selected. To assess whether the HSS instrument should be included on GeoXO, we applied a value of information approach and found the benefits associated with this instrument are likely to substantially outweigh the costs. Value of information studies often focus on data and information that has a direct use case. Estimating benefits for the HSS is especially challenging because data are not used directly by decision makers. Instead these data along with information from other Earth observing (EO) satellites play a key role in producing the inputs necessary for modern numerical hydrometeorological modeling. We describe strategies to assess the marginal (i.e., incremental) contribution of an instrument that is part of a complex information production process. We make several recommendations that, if implemented, would improve the quality of future studies of this kind. This includes (1) a systems approach to observing system planning, (2) improving the design of observing system experiments (OSSE and OSE), and (3) better tracking of the decisions and needs of end-users, especially those external to the agency.","{""Adkins, Jeffery"",""Conran, Joseph"",""Lauer, Christopher""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2021,"{benchmark}",NA

Therefore, CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations, governments and forest data end-users, particularly those engaged in forestry, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation projects such as REDD+.","{""Koh, Lian Pin"",""McCall, Michael K."",""Napoletano, Brian M."",""Paneque-Galvez, Jaime"",""Wich, Serge A.""}","10.3390/f5061481",2024-09-27 23:36:45,"included",NA,2014,"{}","{""degradation; conservation"",""safeguard information systems; deforestation"",""unmanned aircraft systems; unmanned aerial vehicle; remote sensing; tropical forests; community-base""}"

It brought together around 60 economists, engineers, scientists, policy makers and key personnel from space agencies and international organisations to discuss the motivations, the approaches and the challenges for valuing EO. During a dense three days programme, the participants shared ideas about areas for improvement and elaborated concrete recommendations to support the advancement of EO valuation practices. The working sessions, addressing separately different types of\nbenefits (i.e. socio-economic, socio- environmental, regulatory, on innovation and entrepreneurship and on scientific research), stimulated the participants to discuss the challenges intrinsic to the measurement of the different impacts. The splinter sessions allowed concrete and interactive discussions among small groups, whose conclusions were brought together during a final session.

6903653,"Costs And Benefits Of Satellite-Based Tools For Irrigation Management","This paper presents the results of a collaborative work with farmers and a cost-benefit analysis of geospatial technologies applied to irrigation water management in a semi-arid agricultural area in Lower Austria. We use Earth observation (Eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (Et) and webGlS technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers. The study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments. The calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers. In most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops. At the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types. Our data clearly indicates that economic benefits could be achieved by reducing irrigation volumes, especially for water-intensive crops. Regarding the qualitative evaluation, most of the farmers expressed a very positive interest in the provided information. In particular, information related to crop ET was appreciated as this helps to make better informed decisions on irrigation. The majority of farmers (54\%) also expressed a general willingness to pay, either directly or via cost sharing, for such a service. Based on different cost scenarios, we calculated the cost of the service. Considering 20,000 ha regularly irrigated land, the advisory service would cost between 2.5 and 4.3 (sic)/ha per year depending on the type of satellite data used. For comparison, irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 /ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters per ha. With a correct irrigation application, more than 10\% of the water and energy could be saved in water-intensive crops, which is equivalent to an economic benefit of 40-100 (sic)/ha per year.",NA,"10.3389/fenvs.2015.00052",2024-09-26 00:56:36,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6691656,"The economic value of drought information for water management under climate change: a case study in the Ebro basin","Drought events in the Mediterranean are likely to increase in frequency, duration and intensity due to climate change, thereby affecting crop production. Information about drought is valuable for river basin authorities and the farmers affected by their decisions. The economic value of this information and the resulting decisions are of interest to these two stakeholder groups and to the information providers. Understanding the dynamics of extreme events, including droughts, in future climate scenarios for the Mediterranean is being improved continuously. This paper analyses the economic value of information on drought events taking into account the risk aversion of water managers. We consider the effects of drought management plans on rice production in the Ebro river basin. This enables us to compute the willingness to compensate the river basin authority for more accurate information allowing for better decision-making. If runoff is reduced, river basin planners can consider the reduction of water allocation for irrigation in order to eliminate the risk of water scarcity. Alternately, river basin planners may decide to maintain water allocation and accept a reduction of water supply reliability, leaving farmers exposed to drought events. These two alternatives offer different risk levels for crop production and farmers’ incomes which determine the value of this information to the river basin authority. The information is relevant for the revision of River Basin Management Plans of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) within the context of climate change.","{""Quiroga, Sonia""}","https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-11-643-2011",2024-04-26 18:51:07,"included",NA,2011,"{}",NA
6691575,"Do users benefit from additional information in support of operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin?","We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.","{""Lines, Clara""}","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5901-2018",2024-04-22 03:04:55,"included",NA,2018,"{}",NA

Since no specific path was officially recognized before our study, the remains of the road did not benefit from heritage protection. In 2017, we made a project to determine the course of the road through rural alava. In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying. By using precision farming techniques we have identified the course of the Roman road Iter 34 in several locations in a short period of time and with few resources.",NA,"10.3390/rs11060725",2024-10-03 22:22:34,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA

Their spatial resolution sets limitations to their use, as coarse datasets are not suitable for detecting small-scale phenomena. In this study, we explored the effects of spatial resolution on the ecological outcome of a conservation prioritization process in Zonation software. Our study area was in Evo, southern Finland, covering a mosaic of managed and conserved forests. We produced the feature layers describing the forest characteristics using high-resolution remote sensing datasets, object-based mapping methods, and forest site type data. We found that increasing the resolution above the 16 m baseline resolution resulted in substantial errors. The conservation errors were the highest for rare features related to European Aspen, whereas the common features related to dominant tree species could benefit from the growth of cell size. We conclude that adequate spatial resolution is a prerequisite for efficient conservation prioritization, and that the size and spatial distribution of the features affect the resolution requirements.","{""Heinaro, Einari"",""Kujala, Heini"",""Kumpula, Timo"",""Mayra, Janne"",""Mikkonen, Ninni"",""Tanhuanpaa, Topi""}","10.1007/s13280-023-01885-6",2024-07-12 19:32:06,"included",NA,2023,"{}","{""Conservation prioritization; Forests; Remote sensing; Scale; Spatial resolution; Zonation""}"
6903621,"Integrating Field And Satellite Data For Spatially Explicit Inference On The Density Of Threatened Arboreal Primates","Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.",NA,"10.1002/eap.1438",2024-09-26 01:06:46,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6863244,"Is Acoustic Tracking Appropriate For Air-Breathing Marine Animals? Dugongs As A Case Study","Marine animals face increased pressure through expanded shipping and recreational activities. Effective conservation and management of large species like marine mammals or sea turtles depend on knowledge of movement and habitat use. Previous studies have used data collected from either satellite or acoustic telemetry but rarely both. In this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efficacy of satellite and acoustic telemetry to define dugong movement patterns; compare the benefits and limitations of each approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate telemetry data to the boundaries of a Go Slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike within an urbanised coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). Twenty-one dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the Eastern Banks of Moreton Bay in July-September 2012 and July 2013 and fitted with GPS and acoustic transmitters. Both satellite and acoustic telemetry produced reliable presence and movement data for individual dugongs. When the dugongs were within the range of the acoustic array, there was relatively good correspondence between the overall space use measures derived from GPS and acoustic transmitters, demonstrating that acoustic tracking is a potentially valuable and cost-effective tool for monitoring local dugong habitat use in environments equipped with acoustic receiver arrays. Acoustic technology may be particularly useful for species that establish home ranges with stable residency especially near large urban or port environs. However, the relative merits of the two technologies depend on the research question in the context of the species of interest, the location of the study and whether the study site has an established acoustic array.

6691601,"Cost and value of multidisciplinary fixed-point ocean observatories","Sustained ocean observations are crucial to understand both natural processes occurring in the ocean and human influence on the marine ecosystems. The information they provide increases our understanding and is therefore beneficial to the society as a whole because it contributes to a more efficient use and protection of the marine environment, upon which human livelihood depends. In addition the oceans, which occupy 73% of the planet surface and host 93% of the biosphere, play a massive role in controlling the climate. Eulerian or fixed-point observatories are an essential component of the global ocean observing system as they provide several unique features that cannot be found in other systems and are therefore complementary to them. In addition they provide a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, combining physical, chemical and biological observations on several time scales. The fixed-point open ocean observatory network (FixO3) integrates the 23 European open ocean fixed-point observatories in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. The programme also seeks to improve access to key installations and the knowledge they provide for the wider community, from scientists, to businesses, to civil society. This paper summarises the rationale behind open ocean observatories monitoring the essential ocean variables. It also provides an estimate of the costs to operate a typical fixed-point observatory such as those included in the FixO3 network.

Year-to-year variations in U.S. climate result from El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a quasi-periodic redistribution of heat and momentum in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The study described here represents a preliminary assessment of the value to the entire U.S. agricultural sector of improved ENSO forecasts in the southeastern United States. This interdisciplinary assessment combines data and models from meteorology, plant sciences, and economics under a value of information framework based on Bayesian decision theory. An economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector uses changes in yields for various ENSO phases to translate physical (yield) effects of ENSO changes into economic effects on producers and on domestic and foreign consumers. The value of perfect information to agriculture is approximately $145 million. The economic value of an imperfect forecast is $96 million. These results suggest that increases in forecast accuracy have substantial economic value to agriculture.","{""Adams, Richard""}","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7287.1995.tb00720.x",2024-04-26 19:03:40,"included",NA,1995,"{}",NA

The paper briefly describes the ITACA project and its aims. During the project an economic impact assessment is carried out, initially from a qualitative point of view, through the submission of a questionnaire to the partners involved in the project. The same questionnaire was given also to identified End-Users in order to investigate the precise stakeholders' nature and behaviour and the likely economic modifications they will undergo once the project takes shape and new technical propositions are made potentially available also by way of different service models. Factors affecting positively and negatively the various stakeholder’s communities will be listed and discussed in full. Next stage is involving the quantification of potential benefits ITACA project may produce. Therefore, an evaluation of effects on economic activities of the areas and on communities the archaeological sites is being made. Once qualitative and quantitative assessments are completed, a business plan outlining also the appropriate road/roads to market is going to be prepared and suggestions will be made about which organizational/governance model best fit the expected results.

Remote sensing of trees is used in commercial applications but has limited uptake in the fire management community. A two-stage detection and identification convolutional network for high-resolution RGB drone imagery is developed to address this limitation. The detection routine is based on DeepForest, an existing convolutional neural network implementation designed to recognize trees in aerial imagery. Retraining the model and implementing an adaptive window-size workflow improves tree detection, with F-1 scores reaching 85\% and averaging 72\% for k-fold cross-validation in boreal forest. For classification, a VGG19 network with added data augmentation and dropout layers is trained. When this network is implemented, manually annotated trees are recognized as coniferous with an average F-1 of 97\% and deciduous with an 87\% F-1. Overall, the developed image-to-attribute model for trees reaches a maximum F-1 score of 85\% considering classification after identification, with averages of 72\% for coniferous trees and 57\% for deciduous trees over six sites. Tree height, size, and stem density are extracted from the tree location output and geometric data. The calculated density is compared to the density of manual annotations, with an average R-2 of 0.90.

A variety of parameters can be inferred via altimeter measurements, including sea surface height, sea surface wind speeds, significant wave heights, and topography of land, sea ice, and ice sheets. Taking advantage of these parameters with the long record of altimeter data spanning multiple decades has allowed a diverse range of societal applications. As the constellation of altimeter satellites grows, the proven value of the missions to a diverse user community can now be demonstrated by highlighting a selection of verifiable success stories. In this paper, we review selected altimeter success stories that incorporate altimetry data, alone or in conjunction with numerical models or other Earth observations, to solve a key societal problem. First, we define the problem or the key challenge of each use case, and then we articulate the uptake of the successful altimeter-based solution. Our review revealed steady progress by scientific and stakeholder communities in bridging the gap between data availability and their actual uptake to address a variety of applications. Highlighting these altimeter-based success stories can serve to further promote the widespread adoption of future satellite missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission scheduled for launch in 2022.

6691628,"Value of information for climate observing systems","The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system. As illustration, the VOI for the proposed spaceborne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne systems is computed. Depending on details of the decision context, the VOI ranges from 2 to 30 trillion US dollars.","{""Cooke, Roger""}","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-013-9451-8",2024-04-25 02:40:40,"included",NA,2014,"{}","{""Climate observing system|Social cost of carbon|DICE|CLARREO|value of information""}"

We first describe the EO value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit. We then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the EO value chain. Finally, we present ""10 rules"" that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of Earth science information. The 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions. Some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole. Each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points. The rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection ofsolutions.

Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts. Both the role of Big Data and associated technologies are discussed as they relate to the ultimate use of Landsat-derived information products to guide decision-making, and key data ecosystem characteristics that shape the likelihood of these products’ use are highlighted.","{""Molder, Edmund""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.805174",2024-04-22 02:47:29,"included",NA,2022,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""Landsat|data ecosystem|values|decision support|societal benefits|qualitative|remote sensing|Earth ob""}"
6691530,"Valuing User Preferences for Geospatial Fire Monitoring in Guatemala","Like many landscapes across Central America, forests in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) are increasingly susceptible to forest fire, with most forest fires resulting from untended agricultural fires. Fire damage poses significant risk to the MBR’s natural resources and cultural heritage, but budget challenges limit the capacity of national, regional, and local institutions to effectively detect, monitor, and control forest fires. The Geospatial Information System for Fire Management (SIGMA-I) is a United States government-subsidized suite of geospatial fire management tools that are widely disseminated, free of charge, to land managers and other users in Guatemala for on-the-ground fire prevention and response. Provision of SIGMA-I geospatial data and tools such as daily thermal “hotspot” maps provide positive benefits for sustainable fire management. However, little research exists supporting the nonmarket monetary value of geospatial fire monitoring tools and their component features. We used a choice experiment to estimate land managers’ willingness to pay for individual attributes of SIGMA-I hotspot mapping in Guatemala. We found quantitative evidence of positive willingness to pay for geospatial data, demonstrating positive nonmarket value of geospatial data for sustainable fire management in developing countries and regions where agricultural fires are common. Our results indicate strong preferences from Guatemala’s forest fire management community for improving the frequency of hotspot reporting and reducing detection of erroneous hotspots. As the availability of geospatial data increases, use of tools like SIGMA-I has the potential to significantly improve fire management, especially in regions where funding and resources for fire management are scarce. Our results support continued multinational funding for tools like SIGMA-I for forest fire management in Guatemala and other developing countries.","{""Berenter, Jared""}","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132112077",2024-04-22 23:38:29,"included",NA,2021,"{}","{""Guatemala|Maya Biosphere Reserve|geospatial|remote sensing|forest fire|hotspot|value of information|""}"

GOOS will provide long-term ocean data based on a globally coordinated strategy. These data will be used for climate forecasting. The Seawatch Europe project of the European Marine environment programme (EUROMAR) Is an on-line monitoring and surveillance system of the North Sea and Is a regional component of GOOS. Seawetch forecasts and environmental data are distributed to public authorities, aquecuiture/fish farming, commercial fishing, tourist Industry, research Institutes, navy and coastguards. The Seawatch system Is now operative In Norway and Thailand. it is at present Installed In Spain, and Indonesia Seawatch has aroused considerable Interest In Sweden, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Mexico, China, Korea and the USA. In this paper some of the results of a benefit-coat analysis of the Seawatch System are discuseed. So far the main revenues occur in the oll and gas exploitation, commercial flsherless end fish farming, tourism, meteorological forecasting, crises management etc. It is calculated that in the North Sea, a delay of 105 minutes in startup of the productional of a well will cover the costs of Seawatch. The global potential for the Seawatch System in the Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a running cost of $100 million per year. A strong point of the Seawatch system is that it is commercially off-the-shelf technology. Seawatch is, however, still competing with academic and governmental institutions for funds when viewed as either a research venture or an operational programme. It is important for public authorities at the national and international level to participate in Seawatch and help to steer it towards the potential it was designed to fulfil namely a building stone of GOOS.","{""Stel, Jan H.""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/0308-597X(96)00029-2",2024-04-26 19:04:25,"included",NA,1996,"{}",NA
6691712,"The value of climate information when farm programs matter","Predictability of seasonal climate variations associated with ENSO suggests a potential to reduce farm risk by tailoring agricultural management strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions. Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanut–cotton–corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La Niña or El Niño ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels. However, more risk averse farmers could still benefit moderately from El Niño and marginally from La Niña forecasts when they participate in CLP and CIP.","{""Cabrera, Victor""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2006.04.005",2024-04-26 19:05:02,"included",NA,2006,"{}","{""Farm risk reduction|Farm government intervention|El Niño Southern Oscillation|Whole farm simulation|""}"

Using open-source platforms like Google Earth Engine, the approach streamlines training sample generation and assesses diverse machine learning algorithms on pre- and post-disaster Landsat images. The innovation lies in its semi-automatic training sample generation methodology, reducing time and manual effort for accurate land cover mapping and addressing the challenge of crafting training samples in disaster settings. The methodology was tested on the 2010 Chilean earthquake and tsunami, revealing a 45% increase in sediment cover and a 15% reduction in water cover, underlining vast landscape alterations. SVM stood out for its consistent accuracy. To validate the methodological robustness and broaden its applicability, we replicated the procedures using diverse land cover collection, including ESA WorldCover 10 m and Dynamic World. This comprehensive validation encompassed varied catastrophic events, extending the methodology’s relevance beyond its original scope. The consistent findings across different scenarios underscored the method’s robustness and underscored its potential for broader utilization. This streamlined, cost-effective approach suits multiple land cover products, setting the stage for constant Earth feature monitoring.

Satellites allow observing different natural and socio-economic phenomena that would be very hard and costly to monitor from the ground with the same optimal coverage, accuracy and consistency, providing valuable information both to the private and public sector. These phenomena include global societal challenges, such as climate change and air pollution, as well as local ones such as precision farming, urbanisation and transport infrastructures monitoring. This working paper aims at paving the way to a comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic impact of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) concerning the creation of innovative products and services generated by the Earth Observation (EO)1. Although the wide range of potential applications of EO satellite data, little is known about the effective use of Cosmo SkyMed (CSK) data so far.

In this study, an ecological evaluation model based on the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to measure the ecological environment of the Shibing Karst World Heritage Site and its buffer zone and the Moran index and geographic probe model were combined to quantify the ecological environment. The results show that, (1) from 2013 to 2020, the ecological environment quality of the heritage site and buffer zone was moderate to high and the mean RSEI values in the three periods studied were 0.720, 0.723 and 0.742, showing an overall upward and improving trend; (2) ecological environment quality grades of moderate and good accounted for more than 70\% of the area, the distribution pattern of ecological environment quality is significantly better at the heritage site than in the buffer zone and the southwest is better than the northeast; (3) the Moran index increased from 0.600 in 2013 to 0.661 in 2020, residing in the first and third quadrants, respectively, with significantly spatial aggregation; and (4) greenness and humidity were shown to play a positive feedback role on the ecological environment quality and the spatial influence ability of humidity and dryness was greater. Overall, the RSEI is an effective method of evaluating and monitoring the ecological environment quality of heritage sites, the ecological environment quality of the Karst heritage site in Shibing is in a steady state of improvement and the relevant departments of heritage conservation need to further coordinate the relationship between conservation and development to promote the sustainable development of the heritage site and provide effective solutions for the monitoring of other Karst World Heritage sites.","{""Shen, Chuhong"",""Xiao, Hua"",""Xiong, Kangning"",""Zhang, Juan"",""Zhang, Ning""}","10.3390/land12010184",2024-07-15 15:57:34,"included",NA,2023,"{}","{""remote sensing; ecological environment; world natural neritage; Shibing Karst; South China Karst""}"

6447802,"A Conceptual Framework for Assessing the Benefits of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems","The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Speciﬁcally, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and speciﬁcally, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the beneﬁts of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal beneﬁt areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “beneﬁt chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the beneﬁts, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and beneﬁt curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.","{""Bouma, J."",""Fritz, S."",""Obersteiner, M."",""Reyers, B."",""Scholes, R.J.""}","10.1109/JSYST.2008.926688",NA,NA,NA,2008,"{benchmark}",NA

With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder-oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.","{""Bouma, J.

Thus, the use of reclaimed water will depend on the reuse opportunities and the cost of the required infrastructure. Historically, centralized wastewater treatment facilities have served the needs of organized societies since the mid 1800s. However. as there are limited options for expansion of most existing centralized facilities, the use of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems offers significant advantages including being close both to the source of wastewater generation and to potential water reuse applications. The comparative advantages of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems for a number of water reuse applications are presented and discussed in this paper.

6863704,"The Role Of Remote Sensing In The Development Of Smart Indicators For Ecosystem Services Assessment","Human beings benefit from a wide range of goods and services from the natural environment that are collectively known as ecosystem services. However, rapid natural habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change is causing accelerating losses of populations and species, with largely unknown consequences on ecosystem functioning and the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. It is crucial, therefore, to develop a suite of indicators of the health and status of ecosystems, to monitor and quantify services delivery and to facilitate policy responses to stop and reverse negative trends. An effective framework to facilitate the development of suitable indicators is by using the SMART approach, which defines five criteria that could be applied to set monitoring and management goals, which are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive. Remote sensing provides a useful data source that can monitor ecosystems over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although the development and application of landscape indicators (vegetation indices, for example) derived from remote sensing data are comparatively advanced, it is acknowledged that a number of organisms and ecosystem processes are not detectable by remote sensing. This paper explores several approaches to overcome this limitation, by examining the strong affinity of species with dominant habitat structures and through the coupling of remote sensing and ecosystem process models using examples drawn from a number of important ecosystems. © 2016 Biodiversity Conservancy International.","{""Brown, C."",""Cutler, M.

6903526,"Societal Need For Improved Understanding Of Climate Change, Anthropogenic Impacts, And Geo-Hazard Warning Drive Development Of Ocean Observatories In European Seas","Society's needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This evaluation integrates remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, aerodynamic principles, and Landsat7 ETM+ images. Three main procedures were carried out in this study; the first derived the surface temperature from Landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantified evaporation loss to the secondary channels' level over one month (March) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface temperature of the raster data; the third procedure applied GIS suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected. The results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2.73 mm/day at the middle of the lake to 9.58 mm/day at the edge. The evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0.86 billion m(3) /month (March). The analysis suggests that it is possible to save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19.7 million m(3) / month (March), and thus 2.4 billion m(3) /year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate construction heights of 8 m and 15 m. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS are useful for applications in remote locations where field-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management.

6863189,"Three Most Widely Used Gnss-Based Shoreline Monitoring Methods To Support Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policies","Shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). It provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides information necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones. Shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability. For monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could benefit policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern. However, various GNSS methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difficult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach. Using a case study of the Pernambuco State ICZM in Brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used GNSS-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (RK), real-time kinematic (RTK), and precise point positioning (PPP) methods. It also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations. The results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for supporting ICZM policies.","{""Awange, J.

Field inventories were carried out in order to understand the characteristics of the stand and the variables that fuel models must include. This information, together with the use of the intensity and structure provided by LiDAR, was used to perform statistical analyses. The linear regressions obtained to characterise the stand of the mixed Quercus spp.-Pinus ssp.-dominated stand had an R-2 value ranging from 0.4393 to 0.66. While working with low-density LiDAR data (which has more difficulties crossing the canopy), in addition to the obtained results, we performed the statistical analysis of the dominant stand to obtain models with R-2 values ranging from 0.8201 to 0.8677. The results of this research show that low-density LiDAR data are significant; however, in mixed stands, it is necessary to only use the dominant stratum because other components generate noise, which reduces the predictive capacity of the models. Additionally, by using the decision tree developed in combination, it is possible to update the mapping of fuel models in inaccessible areas, thereby significantly reducing costs.",NA,"10.3390/f12081011",2024-09-30 21:20:44,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6447804,"The value of remotely-sensed data in terrestrial habitat corridor design for large migratory species","Cost-effective conservation program design to support seasonal migratory species is urgently needed, but to-date has received little attention by economists. Conserving migratory corridors is a complicated design problem because of the large spatial scales over which migratory species can travel and the weakest-link characteristic of the problem. If one section or area of a potential migratory corridor is unable to support species movement, the migration through that route will not be successful. We develop and apply an integer-programming modeling approach that leverages innovative new data products to propose a costeffective, landscape-scale conservation planning approach. We apply our approach to the Cody elk herd range within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), leveraging satellite data on crop type and density over time and GPS collar data on elk migrations. We provide empirical evidence that using new satellite data products can avoid unconnected corridors and increase the cost effectiveness of corridor construction. In the Cody context, we estimate that achieving the conservation outcome associated with using satellite data on both costs and beneﬁts would cost close to twice as much when using satellite beneﬁt data but only limited cost data and about three times as much when using satellite cost data but only limited beneﬁt data. Empirical work across additional herds is needed to provide additional insights into characteristics of contexts under which we expect gains from satellite and/or GPS collar data.","{""Gigliotti, Laura"",""Kroetz, Kailin"",""Leonard, Bryan"",""Middleton, Arthur""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2022,"{benchmark}",NA

The imagery is currently available at no cost through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). We conducted a survey in early 2012 to explore who uses Landsat imagery, how they use the imagery, and what the value of the imagery is to them. The survey was sent to all users registered with USGS (users who have created a login and password to access imagery through USGS directly) who had accessed Landsat imagery in the year prior to the survey (n = 44,731). All contact with users was via email and the survey was administered online. The response rate was 30% with 13,473 users responding. Of those users, 11,275 were current Landsat users who had used the imagery in their work in the year prior to the survey.

6903598,"Cloud Cover And Its Impact On Brazil's Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Program: Evidence From The Cerrado Biome Of The Brazilian Legal Amazon","The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7\% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US\$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.",NA,"10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102651",2024-09-26 01:03:50,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA

6691635,"Bayesian framework for assessing the value of scientific space systems: value of information approach with application to earth science spacecraft","Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholders’ beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to justify the acquisition of the system. Additionally, the system is analyzed in Cost-VOD trade space to provide program managers with additional insights into the coupling of a system's predicted value generation and its associated lifecycle cost.","{""Brathwaite, Joy""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.10.036",2024-04-25 02:38:54,"included",NA,2013,"{}","{""Spacecraft design|Information value|Bayesian framework|Unpriced system""}"
6903469,"Enabling Efficient Service Function Chains At Terrestrial-Satellite Hybrid Cloud Networks","The great improvements in both satellite and terrestrial networks have motivated the academic and industrial communities to rethink their integration. As a result, there is an increasing interest in new-generation hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks, where sufficient flexibility should be enabled to deploy customized SFCs to satisfy the growing diversity of user needs. However, it is still challenging to achieve such a nice vision, since many key issues remain unaddressed comprehensively such as framework design, communication procedures and resource optimization. Therefore, in this article, we focus on how to efficiently deploy customized SFCs at terrestrial-satellite hybrid cloud networks. In particular, we first propose an elastic framework used for SFC deployment at clouds, and second propose an efficient SFC mapping approach for improvement of system resource utilization. Finally, we verify the proposed framework at a proof-of-concept prototype via a number of use cases, and evaluate the proposed mapping approach through extensive simulations based on a real-world topology.

The most desirable dissemination channels are radio, local elders, local farmer meetings and extension agents. The most likely used farming strategies are change of: planting date, crop acreage, crop variety, and production intensification. The vast majority of farmers are willing to pay for seasonal climate forecasts, and the average annual economic value of seasonal climate forecasts are about USD 5492 for the 354 sampled farmers and USD 66.5 million dollar at the national level. Furthermore, benefits of seasonal climate forecasts are likely to increase with better access to farmer based organisation, to extension services, to financial services, to modern communication tools, intensity of use of fertilizer and with larger farm sizes. Seasonal climate forecasts are a source of improvement of farmers’ performance and the service should be integrated in extension programmes and in national agricultural development agenda.","{""Amegnaglo, Coco""}","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2017.06.007",2024-04-23 22:39:25,"included",NA,2017,"{}","{""Benefits|Heckman model|Farming strategies|Seasonal climate forecasts|Willingness to pay""}"

However, the use of different types of images concerning the same landscape may influence social preferences and thus perceptions of landscape management and planning decisions. We evaluated landscape preferences and perceptions in four landscapes of southern Chile. We specifically: (1) compared people's perceptions related to living in, visiting, the scenic beauty, well-being, risks, and level of landscape disturbance; and (2) evaluated the influence of the type of scene (i.e., eye-level or aerial images) in these preferences and perceptions. Preferences and perceptions resulted to be better when using eye-level (4.0 +/- 1.1) than aerial (3.7 +/- 0.6) images. In general, we observed a negative association between preferences and perceptions and the landscape disturbance; however, it was consistent when using aerial images but was masked when valuing landscape through eye-level images. Implications of these results are relevant because by far, most landscape preference studies use traditional eye-level images.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently funded activities to enhance remote sensing inputs to FEWS NET. A professional review was conducted to elicit Earth observation requirements for FEWS NET. It focused upon operational requirements of FEWS NET end-users to determine qualities of useful remote sensing data and data products. In this manner, properties of certain biophysical predictions that would be beneficial as FEWS NET supplementary inputs could be ascertained. Reviewers were asked to evaluate the importance of environmental variables and spatiotemporal requirements for Earth science data inputs, particularly for rainfall and vegetation products. The review was implemented in 2007 as an online questionnaire and was completed by more than 40 experts from around the world. This professional review questionnaire was shown to be a viable tool for the rapid derivation, compilation, and analysis of requirements necessary to enhance FEWS NET.

6903658,"Monitoring Soil-Plant Interactions And Maize Yield By Satellite Vegetation Indexes, Soil Electrical Conductivity And Management Zones","In modern agriculture, understanding the spatio-temporal variability in crop fields and the implications of environmental factors in soil management are important for sustainable practices. In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield.

Traditional tools based on the value of information are sometimes difficult to apply. When risks are traded in a market, it may be possible to use market instruments to monetize the reductions in uncertainty. This paper illustrates such market-based methods with a satellite system designed to reduce uncertainty in predicting soil moisture in the USA. Soil moisture is a key variable in managing agricultural production and predicting crop yields. Using data on corn and soybean futures, we find that a 30% reduction in the weather-related component of uncertainty in corn and soybean futures pricing yields a yearly US consumer surplus of $1.44 billion. The total present value of information from the satellite system for the USA—calculated with a 3% discount rate—is about $22 billion, assuming the system is in operation for 20 years.

Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain. © 2010 The Authors.

This paper explores a scaled-up participatory method developed by YouthMappers, for creating missing geospatial data derived from remotely sensed imagery in order to contribute to persistent data needs in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries.

6863054,"Forest Fire Risk Zone Mapping Of Eravikulam National Park In India: A Comparison Between Frequency Ratio And Analytic Hierarchy Process Methods","Forest fire is one of the most common natural hazards occurring in the Western Ghats region of Kerala and is one of the reasons for forest degradation. This natural disaster causes considerable damage to the biodiversity of this region during the dry fire season. The area selected for the present study, Eravikulam National Park, which is predominantly of grassland vegetation, is also prone to forest fires. This study aims to delineate the forest fire risk zones in Eravikulam National Park using remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. In the present study, methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) were used to derive the weights, and the results were compared. We have used seven factors, i.e. land cover types, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, slope angle, slope aspect, distance from the settlement, and distance from the road to prepare the fire risk zone map. The area of the prepared risk zone maps is divided into three zones, namely low, moderate, and high. From the study, it was found that the fire occurring in this area is due to natural as well as anthropogenic factors. The prepared forest fire risk zone maps are validated using the fire incidence data for the period from January 2003 to June 2019 collected from the records of the Forest Survey of India. The investigation revealed that 72\% and 24\% of the fire incidences occurred in the high risk zone of the maps prepared using the AHP and FR methods, respectively, which ascertained the superiority of the AHP method over the FR method for forest fire risk zone mapping. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis gives an area under the ROC curve (ALIC) value of 0.767 and 0.567 for the AHP and FR methods, respectively. The risk zone maps will be useful for staff of the forest department, planners, and officials of the disaster management department to take effective preventive and mitigation measures.","{""Ajin, R.

6862799,"Mapping Landscape-Scale Peatland Degradation Using Airborne Lidar And Multispectral Data","Context: An increased interest in the restoration of peatlands for delivering multiple benefits requires a greater understanding of the extent and location of natural and artificial features that contribute to degradation. Objectives: We assessed the utility of multiple, fine-grained remote sensing datasets for mapping peatland features and associated degraded areas at a landscape-scale. Specifically, we developed an integrated approach to identify and quantify multiple types of peatland degradation including: anthropogenic drainage ditches and peat cuttings; erosional gullies and bare peat areas. Methods: Airborne LiDAR, CASI and aerial image datasets of the South West UK, were combined to identify features within Dartmoor National Park peatland area that contribute to degradation. These features were digitised and quantified using ArcGIS before appropriate buffers were applied to estimate the wider ecohydrologically affected area. Results: Using fine-scale, large-extent remotely sensed data, combined with aerial imagery enabled key features within the wider expanse of peatland to be successfully identified and mapped at a resolution appropriate to future targeted restoration. Combining multiple datasets increased our understanding of spatial distribution and connectivity within the landscape. An area of 29 km2 or 9.2% of the Dartmoor peatland area was identified as significantly and directly ecohydrologically degraded. Conclusions: Using a combination of fine-grained remotely sensed datasets has advantages over traditional ground survey methods for identification and mapping of anthropogenic and natural erosion features at a landscape scale. The method is accurate, robust and cost-effective particularly given the remote locations and large extent of these landscapes, facilitating effective and targeted restoration planning, management and monitoring. © 2019, The Author(s).","{""Anderson, K."",""Brazier, R.

6691612,"Economic Assessment of the Use Value of Geospatial Information","Geospatial data inform decision makers. An economic model that involves application of spatial and temporal scientific, technical, and economic data in decision making is described. The value of information (VOI) contained in geospatial data is the difference between the net benefits (in present value terms) of a decision with and without the information. A range of technologies is used to collect and distribute geospatial data. These technical activities are linked to examples that show how the data can be applied in decision making, which is a cultural activity. The economic model for assessing the VOI in geospatial data for decisionmaking is applied to three examples: (1) a retrospective model about environmental regulation of agrochemicals; (2) a prospective model about the impact and mitigation of earthquakes in urban areas; and (3) a prospective model about developing private–public geospatial information or an ecosystem services market.

6863572,"Flood Risk Analysis: The Case Of Tigris River (Tikrit /Iraq)","The study of flood risks has a fundamental role in ensuring the safety of cities near rivers and drawing up plans to protect them during future floods. This study aims to manage potential flood risks, and Tikrit city was used as a case study. The daily discharge of the Tigris River in the study area was provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources from 2019 to 2022. The HEC-RAS software was utilized to build a 2-D flood model to simulate potential flood scenarios. First, the model was calibrated by adjusting the value of Manning's coefficient (n), and it was found that n = 0.031 reflects the nature of the region because the Nash-Sutcliff Error (NSE) was 0.93. Then, the efficiency of the 2-D flood model was verified by comparing the model’s results with the study area’s satellite images, and the results showed a great match. Following that, the 2-D model was used under different flooding scenarios. The results showed that the size of areas exposed to flooding increased with the discharges passing through the Tigris River. For instance, increasing the discharge to 800m3/s increased the flooded areas by 13.7%, while increasing the discharge to 1500 m3/s increased the flooded areas by 90.7 % compared to the river’s normal flow. Also, the results showed that the eastern regions of the riverbanks are more vulnerable to flooding than the western side because the ground levels are low on the eastern side compared to the western part of the riverbanks. © 2023 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, TIKRIT UNIVERSITY.","{""Khairallah, R.

6903573,"Evaluating Performance Of Community-Based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-Sensing Technologies To Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management","An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77\% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50\% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.",NA,"10.1007/s41101-023-00222-y",2024-09-27 22:42:45,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6691750,"Agricultural Producers' Willingness to Pay for Real-Time Mesoscale Weather Information","Mesoscale weather networks can provide improved weather information to agricultural producers. This technology can potentially improve production decisions, reduce irrigation and pesticide inputs, and reduce weather-related losses. Developing a mesoscale network to disseminate real-time mesoscale weather information requires a substantial investment. In addition, there are costs associated with maintenance of the system and distribution of the information available. While public funds may be available to support initial development of the system, there may be less public support for maintaining the system and subsidizing users' access to the information. This study uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of Oklahoma farmers and ranchers, as one set of potential users, to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information. The results indicate that agricultural producers are willing to pay only a modest fee for improved weather information. Gross sales, irrigation, and past weather losses are among the factors shown to significantly impact willingness to pay.","{""Kenkel, Phil""}","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40987744",2024-04-22 03:04:10,"included",NA,1995,"{}","{""contingent valuation|decision aids|mesoscale weather information""}"

Results show that the two approaches are able to extract large numbers of discontinuity facets, in a more practical, rapid and safe way than conventional methods of rock slope stability analysis extending to unreachable yet important parts of the slope. Through this holistic record of the structural condition of the slope the two applications allow the identification of segments that are more prone to instability and failure.

The RO measurement technique was dubbed as ""the most accurate and stable thermometer in space"" because of its high accuracy, high vertical resolution, and high stability, which does not require calibration. Since its launch in 2006, FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC has accumulated over 6.9 million atmospheric and 4.6 million ionospheric RO sounding profiles. Encouraged by the success of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC, Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the planning for the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 mission in 2008 as a follow-on program to FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC. The FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 satellite constellation, consisting of six small satellites, was successfully launched in June, 2019 as the world's first operational RO satellite constellation focusing over the tropics. After fourteen years in service, providing valuable data to operational and research communities, FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC was officially decommissioned ten months after FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 has been sent to space, and replaced by the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2. As expected, the first results from FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 showed positive impact on operational weather prediction and has observed interesting phenomenon in the ionosphere.

While the notion that climate forecasts are potentially valuable has been established, questions of when they may be more or less valuable have proven harder to resolve. Using simulations, we estimate the expected value of seasonal climate information under alternative assumptions about (a) land tenure (ownership vs. short-term leases) and (b) the decision maker’s objective function (expected utility vs. prospect theory value function maximization), employing a full range of plausible parameter values for each objective function. This allows us to show the extent to which the value of information depends on risk preferences, loss aversion, wealth levels and expectations, as well as situational constraints. Our results demonstrate in a non-laboratory decision context that, in some cases, psychologically plausible deviations from expected utility maximization can lead to substantial differences in estimates of the expected value of climate forecasts. Efforts to foster effective use of climate information and forecasts in agriculture must be grounded in a firm understanding of the goals, objectives and constraints of decision makers.","{""Letson, David""}","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9600-8",2024-04-23 22:37:12,"included",NA,2009,"{}","{""Risk Aversion|Expect Utility|Land Owner|Risk Preference|Prospect Theory""}"
6863303,"Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration At Field Scale Using The Harmonized Landsat And Sentinel-2 Dataset, With Sharpened Viirs As A Sentinel-2 Thermal Proxy","Accurate and frequent monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) at sub-field scales can provide valuable information for agricultural water management, quantifying crop water use and stress toward the goal of increasing crop water use efficiency and production. Using land-surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, along with surface reflectance data describing albedo and vegetation cover fraction, surface energy balance models can generate ET maps down to a 30 m spatial resolution. However, the temporal sampling by such maps can be limited by the relatively infrequent revisit period of Landsat data (8 days for combined Landsats 7 and 8), especially in cloudy areas experiencing rapid changes in moisture status. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, as a good complement to the Landsat system, provide surface reflectance data at 10-20 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit period but do not have a thermal sensor. On the other hand, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) provides TIR data on a near-daily basis with 375 m resolution, which can be refined through thermal sharpening using S2 reflectances. This study assesses the utility of augmenting the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset with S2-sharpened VIIRS as a thermal proxy source on S2 overpass days, enabling 30 m ET mapping at a potential combined frequency of 2-3 days (including Landsat). The value added by including VIIRS-S2 is assessed both retrospectively and operationally in comparison with flux tower observations collected from several U.S. agricultural sites covering a range of crop types. In particular, we evaluate the performance of VIIRS-S2 ET estimates as a function of VIIRS view angle and cloud masking approach. VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals (MAE of 0.49 mm d(-1) against observations) generally show comparable accuracy to Landsat ET (0.45 mm d(-1)) on days of commensurate overpass, but with decreasing performance at large VIIRS view angles. Low-quality VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals linked to imperfect VIIRS/S2 cloud masking are also discussed, and caution is required when applying such data for generating ET timeseries. Fused daily ET time series benefited during the peak growing season from the improved multi-source temporal sampling afforded by VIIRS-S2, particularly in cloudy regions and over surfaces with rapidly changing vegetation conditions, and value added for real-time monitoring applications is discussed. This work demonstrates the utility and feasibility of augmenting the HLS dataset with sharpened VIIRS TIR imagery on S2 overpass dates for generating high spatiotemporal resolution ET products.","{""Anderson, Martha C."",""Gao, Feng"",""Hain, Christopher"",""Knipper, Kyle R."",""Kustas, William P."",""Xue, Jie"",""Yang, Yang"",""Yang, Yun""}","10.3390/rs13173420",2024-07-12 23:27:16,"included",NA,2021,"{}","{""Sentinel-2; evapotranspiration; land surface temperature; data fusion; water resource management"",""VIIRS; Harmonized Landsat""}"

To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730. nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a. +. b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a piñon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling. We found that the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) allowed stress to be detected 13. days after girdling - between and 16. days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI traditionally used for satellite based forest health monitoring. We conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress monitoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","{""Ager, A.

6862860,"Possibility Investigation Of Tree Diversity Mapping Using Landsat Etm+ Data In The Hyrcanian Forests Of Iran","Lack of data often limits understanding and management of biodiversity in forested areas. Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DVI, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2, ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R2 = 0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran.

6691692,"Getting the Most out of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based on User–Forecast Interactions","A flexible theoretical model of perceived forecast value is proposed that explicitly includes the effects of user and ensemble characteristics and their interactions. The model can be applied to arbitrary decision problems and is sensitive to a much wider range of factors than traditional forecast valuation models. A simple illustration of its application to the cost–loss decision problem familiar from the forecast valuation literature is discussed. It is shown that perceived value is highly sensitive to perceived model accuracy and that in most cases a high level of perceived accuracy is required for the forecasts to be thought to have any value at all. Decisions with a cost–benefit ratio that is close to the climatological probability of the adverse event are shown to be less sensitive to perceived accuracy. The model shows that it is possible for perceived value to remain unchanged when perceived accuracy increases, thus suggesting an explanation for why forecast uptake often does not increase after improvements in model performance are made. Last, it is argued that attempts to increase forecast uptake should be targeted at those users whose cost–benefit ratios fall in a restricted range that depends on the climatological probability of the event and an objective measure of the ensemble accuracy.","{""Millner, Antony""}","https://doi.org/10.1175/2008JAMC1899.1",2024-04-23 22:38:02,"included",NA,2008,"{}",NA
6691644,"An Economic Value of Remote-Sensing  Information—Application to Agricultural  Production and Maintaining  Groundwater Quality","Does remote-sensing information provide economic benefits to society, and can a value be assigned to those benefits? Can resource management and policy decisions be better informed by coupling past and present Earth observations with groundwater nitrate measurements? Using an integrated assessment approach, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) applied an established conceptual framework to answer these questions, as well as to estimate the value of information (VOI) for remote-sensing imagery. The approach uses moderate-resolution land-imagery (MRLI) data from the Landsat and Advanced Wide Field Sensor satellites that has been classified by the National Agricultural Statistics Service into the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Within the constraint of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s public health threshold for potable groundwater resources, the USGS modeled the relation between a population of the CDL’s land uses and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers in a case study region in northeastern Iowa. Employing various multiscaled, multitemporal geospatial datasets with MRLI to maximize the value of agricultural production, the approach develops and uses multiple environmental science models to address dynamic nitrogen loading and transport at specified distances from specific sites (wells) and at landscape scales (for example, across 35 counties and two aquifers). In addition to the ecosystem service of potable groundwater, this effort focuses on the use of MRLI for the management of the major land uses in the study region—the production of corn and soybeans, which can impact groundwater quality. Derived methods and results include (1) economic and dynamic nitrate-pollution models, (2) probabilities of the survival of groundwater, and (3) a VOI for remote sensing. For the northeastern Iowa study region, the marginal benefit of the MRLI VOI (in 2010 dollars) is $858 million ± $197 million annualized, which corresponds to a net present value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits in perpetuity. Given that these economic estimates are derived from one case study in a part of only one State, the estimates provide a lower estimate related to the potential value of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission.","{""Forney, W.M.""}","https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1796/",2024-04-23 22:08:11,"included",NA,2012,"{}",NA

However, the Decadal Survey only captured the perspective of the science community, leading to questions about the inclusion of broader priorities from constituent communities and stakeholders. We present a stakeholder value network analysis for the NASA/NOAA Earth Observation Program. The analysis includes a rigorous articulation of the needs and objectives of 13 major stakeholders and a complete stakeholder value network with 190 individual “value flows” that capture the interactions between all the stakeholders. It produces a novel stakeholder map, graphically indicating the outputs most likely to create a lasting Earth Science program. The most important value loops and program outputs are used to derive a set of highlevel program goals that suggest what NASA and NOAA should do, as well as how they should conduct business. The analysis concludes that international partnerships represent a strong potential partner for certain science missions with greater potential value delivery than currently-prioritized efforts with defense stakeholders and concludes that weather and land-use missions, in addition to climate missions, should be given highest priority; water, human health, and solid Earth missions should be given lower priority based on each science category’s potential for delivering value to the entire stakeholder network.","{""Sutherland, Timothy""}","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2012.09.007",2024-04-25 02:30:34,"included",NA,2012,"{}",NA

In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion.

Previous studies have found that early releases of ENSO phase information could permit agricultural producers to make adjustments in their decisions and in turn generate an increase in agricultural sector welfare. This study examines whether the value of the agricultural responses can be enhanced by releasing more detailed ENSO information. Namely we evaluate the implications for projected agricultural welfare under release and adaptation to the Stone and Auliciems five phase definition of ENSO states as opposed to the more standard three phase definition. This value is estimated using a stochastic, U.S./global agricultural model representing 22 climate years. The results indicate that the release and exploitation of the more detailed ENSO phase definition almost doubles the welfare impact.

6691734,"The benefits to Mexican agriculture of an El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO) early warning system","Weather agencies worldwide are attempting to determine if systematic disturbances in climate, such as the El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO), can be detected far enough in advance so that decisions can be altered to better accommodate these disturbances. Mexico is one country where ENSO related climatic disturbances have been observed. If climate forecasters were able to disseminate information on upcoming ENSO-induced weather patterns with sufficient lead time, Mexican farmers could adjust by altering a variety of crop decisions, such as growing less (or more) water consumptive crops, planting drought resistant varieties, or altering planting times. This could have a positive impact on crop production, enhancing food security, farmers’ incomes, and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to value such forecasts in a Mexican agricultural setting. \n\nTo assess the economic consequences of climate arising from various ENSO phases, estimates of regional crop yield sensitivity for key crops were modeled using a crop biophysical simulator. The value of a forecast is then measured by the expected increase in economic benefits due to changes in cropping patterns, production and consumption arising from the yield changes under each ENSO phase forecast. These economic estimates are derived from an economic model of Mexican agriculture. The value of the ENSO information will depend on its accuracy in terms of predictions of the weather consequences of each phase.\n\nThe economic model is a stochastic, price endogenous, mathematical programming model that represents agronomic and economic conditions in a five-state Mexican region. This model depicts agricultural behavior across the three ENSO phases and provides the basis for calculating the value of information. The benefits of an ENSO early warning system for Mexico is approximately US$ 10 million annually, based on a 51-year time period of ENSO frequencies and when a forecast skill of 70% is assumed. This value translates into an internal rate of return for such an early warning system of approximately 30%. The values for higher skill levels are correspondingly higher. The values estimated here should be viewed as lower bound estimates of the value of an ENSO early warning system because benefits are not estimated for other parts of Mexican agriculture, such as non commercial (subsistence) agricultural areas, areas where there is only a weak ENSO signal that is not very predictable, and the livestock sector. Also, benefits here do not include benefits that could occur with adjustments in energy generation, water management, or any other economic sectors that may be positively affected by the existence of an ENSO early warning system.\n","{""Adams, Richard""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1923(02)00201-0",2024-04-26 19:09:05,"included",NA,2002,"{}","{""Mexico|Climate forecast|ENSO|Economic value|Agriculture""}"
6691725,"Using willingness‐to‐pay to assess the economic value of weather forecasts for multiple commercial sectors","This paper uses an alternative to the usual cost-avoidance approach to estimating the value of weather forecast products. Value is estimated via a demand-based approach based on the willingness to pay of those who use weather forecast services. Contingent valuation is used to estimate the benefits generated by an automated telephone-answering device that provides weather forecast information to commercial users in the Toronto area of Ontario, Canada. Commercial sectors included in the study are construction, landscaping/snow-removal businesses, TV and film, recreation and sports, agriculture, hotel and catering, and institutions such as schools and hospitals. Average value per call varied by commercial sector, from $2.17 for agricultural users to $0.60 per call for institutional users, with an overall mean of $1.20 per call. At roughly 13,750,000 commercial calls annually, this would result in an estimate of benefits generated by the service to commercial users of $16,500,000 per year.","{""Rollins, Kimberly""}","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1350482703005048",2024-04-25 02:33:57,"included",NA,2003,"{}",NA
6903470,"Rapid Estimation Of Canopy Nitrogen Of Cereal Crops At Paddock Scale Using A Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index","Rising nitrogen (N) fertiliser costs and concerns over environmental impacts have emphasized the need for rapid, non-destructive, paddock-scale tools to support optimal management of N fertiliser in cereal crops. Remote sensing of canopy reflectance is one approach to address the information needed to guide N applications. One remote sensing vegetation index, the Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was developed to address issues of confounding effects of biomass and chlorophyll concentration, and Fitzgerald et al. (2010) linked the CCCI to the Canopy Nitrogen Index (CNI), a scaled index of the plant N. In the research presented here, we extend the work by Fitzgerald et al. (2010) and Cammarano et al. (2011) to whole paddocks with ground-based, airborne and satellite imagery. The methodology was applied to 11 datasets using multispectral cameras deployed on ground-based and airborne platforms, and to satellite imagery. The previously published relationship between CNI and CCCI was applied to the CCCI and biomass measurements from these new datasets to estimate CNI. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.70. A regression using the means from each dataset produced an r(2) of 0.60, and a standard error of 0.82 (\%N). Exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.87 and reduced the standard error to 0.45 (\%N). A crop model (APSIM v7) was used to simulate above ground dry matter to substitute for measured biomass, and plant N was determined from the measured CCCI and simulated biomass. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.49. The regression using the averages from each dataset was not significant (F-pr >0.10); however, exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.89 and reduced the standard error to 0.42 (\%N). To demonstrate the utility of the methods, simulated biomass values coupled with CNI estimated from RapidEye imagery were used to generate paddock maps of plant N. While the agreement between measured and estimated plant N at the paddock scales is not as close as the previous work done at small plot scales, the method shows promise, particularly if biomass can be estimated through modeling or non-destructive measures.

6691572,"Economic value of environmental and weather information for agricultural decisions – A case study for Oklahoma Mesonet","For the past 24 years, weather information and monitoring provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s largest weather and environmental monitoring network) has been used by many farmers across the state to optimize their farm operations and improve profitability of agricultural production. Several research studies delineated advantages of Mesonet weather information for efficient agricultural decision-making. However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center. The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006–2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006–2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.This research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic understanding of the economic value and benefits of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state.","{""Ziolkowska, Jadwiga R.""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.008",2024-04-25 02:41:20,"included",NA,2018,"{}","{Weather,""environmental information|Agriculture|Farm profitability|Economics|Mesonet|Decision-making""}"

6691652,"Socio-Economic Benefits from the Use of Earth Observations","The aim of this document is to report on the workshop on “Socio-economic Benefits of Earth Observations” hold at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Ispra, on 11-13th July 2011. This workshop has been conducted as part of GEO Task US-09-02a: “Socio-Economic Benefits of GEO and GEOSS”, led by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the International Institute for Advanced Spatial Applications (IIASA), and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). It was organized by these three organizations, and by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Twenty-five experts from America, Europe and Australia have gathered in Ispra to present their experience in the field of the evaluation of the benefits from Earth Observations obtained by in-situ, remote and the new citizen’s sensors. The discussion was based on the outcomes of two previous workshops held in 2010 on the same issue, in US and in Europe. The background section presents the rationale behind the need of understanding the benefits Earth Observations, supported by several initiatives at the continental (e.g. INSPIRE Directive in Europe) and at the global (e.g. GEOSS) level. The aim of the workshop, described in the second section of this document, was to support the development of international capabilities to determine, quantify and document the socioeconomic benefits from EO and their use, and to jointly develop a programme of activities to be followed in the next few years by the research group. The foreseen activities of the programme were the consolidation of the body of literature in the field, the collection and analysis of suitable methodologies to assess Earth Observations’ benefits, and of evidence of benefits from existing case studies, the development of appropriate outreach initiatives, the strengthening of the existing community of researchers and the link with other communities of scientists, to set up multidisciplinary studies. To this aim, each participant brought his/her own experience in the analysing and assessing the impacts of Earth Observation in their own field of research, generating an interesting list of multifaceted examples and case studies in which the same problem is analysed from different perspectives. Section 3 contains a summary of each presentation, which gave the elements for the subsequent discussion among experts, leading to the preliminary programme of activities. Among the several subject of discussions there were the value to be ascribed to Earth Observation data, the need of complementing ex-ante impact assessments with monitoring and ex-post evaluations, the need of clearly communicating the benefits to policy makers in order to fund research and as well to provide a service to the society. These discussion topics are summarised in section 4, describing also the view of the experts as regard possible activities for the creation of a body of knowledge about the field, for the definition of a methodology for the estimation of Earth Observations’ benefits, the criteria for selecting suitable case studies to show such benefits and proposal for outreach and dissemination activities. As final recommendations from the workshop, priority should be given to: \n• the development of an accepted scientific paradigm and of a General Economic Framework to measure EO costs and benefits; \n• the establishment of a community of practice bringing together demand and supply; \n• the support to increase the number of researchers active in this field research group; \n• the showcase of concrete projects clearly communicating the benefits achieved. \nMoreover, concrete suggestions were given aimed at developing research activities to establish a consolidated state of the art, mainly consisting in meta-analysis of existing studies and production of high-impact articles or special issues in well-recognised scientific journals.","{""Borzacchiello, Maria-Teresa""}","https://doi.org/10.2788/78532",2024-04-25 02:46:45,"included",NA,2011,"{maybe}",NA

The purpose of this study was to determine the economic potential based on oil palm plantation productivity, with and without using remote sensing-based technology, as well as other variables likely to affect productivity. Primary and secondary data collection methods were also used in this research. There were three quantitative methods being used in this study, namely (i) Multiple regression model with panel data, (ii) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tool, and (iii) Multinomial logistic regression technique. The results showed that the generated economic potential from the utilization of the remote sensing model, had efficient opportunity value of 10.48, which was higher than the non-usage of the technology.

One of its tasks was to develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena, which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model) forecasts.

With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.","{""Bouma, Jetske A.""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.07.016",2024-04-22 02:48:27,"included",NA,2009,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""Value of information|Bayesian decision theory|Marine water quality|Water resource management|Stakeho""}"

With 121 monitoring stations across the state, the Oklahoma Mesonet has developed an array of technologies to observe a variety of atmospheric and soil variables in 5- to 30-min intervals. These consistent observations have been especially critical for predicting and preparing for extreme weather events like droughts, floods, ice storms, and severe convective storms as well as for development of value-added tools. The tools, outreach programs, and mesoscale data have been widely utilized by the general public, state decision-makers, public safety officials, K–12 community, agricultural sector, and researchers, thus generating wide societal and economic benefits to many groups. Based on practical application examples of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet, this paper analyzes both benefits generated by Oklahoma Mesonet information to the public and decision-makers and ripple effects (spreading amplified outcomes/implications) of those benefits in the short and long term.

The intent of this study is to identify the potential of the tree hazard in UiTM Shah Alam from the integration of LiDAR and Pleiades dataset. Tree health condition and tree height were derived from LiDAR and Pleiades dataset. Height of trees were extracted from a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and the condition of tree health were assessed based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Both parameters were used to classify the individual into low, moderate and high-risk ratings. The findings demonstrated that the integration of both datasets successfully identified the potential of tree hazard at the study area. Altogether 108 of individual trees were detected. 7 and 67 trees were identified as high and moderate risk respectively.

This paper attempts to assess the economic benefits of informational investments, specifically of investments in Earth Observation (EO) for managing the Great Barrier Reef. We develop an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the expected contribution of informational investments to decision-making. We hypothesize that EO can improve decision-making by allowing for better-targeted emission reduction measures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. For assessing the benefits (cost savings) of improved targeting we develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments may affect reef quality, or emissions from certain catchments may affect reef quality more. The states reflect the current uncertainties relating to water quality management in the region. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of EO information for managing the GBR can be substantial, and depend on the perceived accuracy of EO information and on decision-makers prior beliefs.","{""Bouma, Jetske A.""}","https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2608005/235180.pdf",2024-04-22 02:59:30,"included",NA,2009,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""Value of information|cost-effectiveness analysis|Earth Observation|marine water quality management|B""}"

6863694,"Food, Water, And Fault Lines: Remote Sensing Opportunities For Earthquake-Response Management Of Agricultural Water","Earthquakes often cause destructive and unpredictable changes that can affect local hydrology (e.g. groundwater elevation or reduction) and thus disrupt land uses and human activities. Prolific agricultural regions overlie seismically active areas, emphasizing the importance to improve our understanding and monitoring of hydrologic and agricultural systems following a seismic event. A thorough data collection is necessary for adequate post-earthquake crop management response; however, the large spatial extent of earthquake's impact makes challenging the collection of robust data sets for identifying locations and magnitude of these impacts. Observing hydrologic responses to earthquakes is not a novel concept, yet there is a lack of methods and tools for assessing earthquake's impacts upon the regional hydrology and agricultural systems. The objective of this paper is to describe how remote sensing imagery, methods and tools allow detecting crop responses and damage incurred after earthquakes because a change in the regional hydrology. Many remote sensing datasets are long archived with extensive coverage and with well-documented methods to assess plant-water relations. We thus connect remote sensing of plantwater relations to its utility in agriculture using a post-earthquake agrohydrologic remote sensing (PEARS) framework; specifically in agro-hydrologic relationships associated with recent earthquake events that will lead to improved water management.

This poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis' and requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage, natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally. It is worth mentioning that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil. Natural drainage (the depth and width are 4-10 m and 50-100 m, respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some salinized villages in the range of 3000-5000 m and ancient groundwater drainage systems, such as Karez are supporting the oasis with drainage water for centuries. In addition landscape characteristics, salinization and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from Landsat image, DEM, literature and field photos. Then based on the gathered information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape. Then according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization approaches were recommended for different landscapes. To address environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was validated by stakeholder opinion. The results provide guidelines for sustainable desalinization design and highlight the importance of combining traditional knowledge and modern ecological principles in sustainable landscape design.","{""Abliz, Abdugheni"",""Lv, Guang-Hui"",""Seydehmet, Jumeniyaz""}","10.3390/su11092578",2024-09-30 01:44:39,"included",NA,2019,"{""stakeholder opinion"",maybe}","{""traditional knowledge; scientific knowledge; landscape ecology; adaptive management; interdisciplina""}"
6903566,"Lessons Learned From Participatory Land Use Planning With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images In Tanzania: Practitioners' And Participants' Perspectives","Participatory mapping (PM) solutions have become common in many sectors of society to enhance engagement of the local communities in planning processes. Especially in data scarce regions, like Africa, PM that captures local knowledge in spatially explicit form is an important tool for integrating previously non-existent spatial knowledge in to collaborative planning. Despite the increasing usage of PM solutions, there still lies a gap in our knowledge of the influence and enabling factors of PM adoption in real-world decision-making processes. We studied practitioners' and participants' perceptions on benefits and limitations of PM that uses high-resolution remote sensing imagery to engage with participants in six use cases in Tanzania. We conducted interviews and one group discussion with practitioners, and feedback surveys among PM participants. According to the experiences of the practitioners and participants, PM methods based on high-resolution remote sensing images have increased practitioners' work quality and professional competence, and enhanced participants' active participation and spatial understanding for informed decision-making. Technical challenges and lack of skilled experts and institutional support were commonly identified limitations. Based on the users' perceptions we identified previously recognized enabling factors such as supportive policy environment but also context specific factors; removal of disincentives and wider awareness raising. Moreover, advocacy among policymakers on the benefits of participatory decision-making and geospatial technologies is needed to build their ownership of the new governance practices.",NA,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105649",2024-09-26 00:47:25,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA

6691559,"The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response","Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions “on the ground” more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) fromapplying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.","{""Oddo, Perry""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00127",2024-04-22 03:02:51,"included",NA,2019,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""value of information|near real-time|emergency response|applied Earth observations|socioeconomic""}"
6691535,"Quantifying the human health benefits of using satellite information to detect cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and manage recreational advisories in U.S. lakes","Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000–$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.","{""Stroming, Signe""}","https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GH000254",2024-04-22 02:48:42,"included",NA,2020,"{}",NA
6863091,"Multi-Decadal Assessment Of Soil Loss In A Mediterranean Region Characterized By Contrasting Local Climates","Soil erosion is one of the most widespread soil degradation phenomena worldwide. Mediterranean landscapes, due to some peculiar characteristics, such as fragility of soils, steep slopes, and rainfall distribution during the year, are particularly subject to this phenomenon, with severe and complex issues for agricultural production and biodiversity protection. In this paper, we present a diachronic approach to the analysis of soil loss, which aims to account for climate variability and land cover dynamics by using remote data about rainfall and land cover to guarantee sufficient observational continuity. The study area (Basilicata, Southern Italy) is characterized by different local climates and ecosystems (temperate, Csa and Csb; arid steppic, Bsk; and cold, Dsb and Dsc), and is particularly suited to represent the biogeographical complexity of the Mediterranean Italy. The well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was applied by integrating information from remote sensing to carry out decadal assessments (1994, 2004, 2014, and 2021) of the annual soil loss. Changes in the rainfall regime and vegetation cover activity were derived from CHIRPS and Landsat data, respectively, to obtain updated information useful for dynamical studies. For the analyzed region, soil loss shows a slight reduction (albeit always remarkable) over the whole period, and distinct spatial patterns between lowland Bsk and Mediterranean mountain Dsb and Dsc climate areas. The most alarming fact is that most of the study area showed soil erosion rates in 2021 greater than 11 t/ha{*}y, which is considered by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) the threshold for identifying severe erosion phenomena. A final comparison with local studies shows, on average, differences of about 5 t ha(-1) y(-1) (minimum 2.5 and maximum 7) with respect to the local estimates obtained with the RUSLE model. The assessment at a regional scale provided an average 9.5\% of soil loss difference for the arable lands and about 10\% for all cultivated areas. The spatial-temporal patterns enhance the relevance of using the cover management factor C derived from satellite data rather than land cover maps, as remote observations are able to highlight the heterogeneity in vegetation density within the same vegetation cover class, which is particularly relevant for agricultural areas. For mountain areas, the adoption of a satellite-gridded rainfall dataset allowed the detection of erosion rate fluctuations due to rainfall variability, also in the case of sparse or absent ground pluviometric stations. The use of remote data represents a precious added value to obtain a dynamic picture of the spatial-temporal variability of soil loss and new insights into the sustainability of soil use in a region whose economy is mostly based on agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources.","{""Coluzzi, Rosa"",""Imbrenda, Vito"",""Lanfredi, Maria"",""Pace, Letizia"",""Samela, Caterina"",""Simoniello, Tiziana""}","10.3390/land11071010",2024-09-27 23:13:34,"included",NA,2022,"{""probably not""}","{""water erosion; soil degradation; RUSLE; Basilicata; agricultural areas; land management; climate var""}"
6691654,"The Value of Ocean Surface Wind Information for Maritime Commerce","Observations, nowcasts, and forecasts of ocean surface wind conditions are of economic value to activities such as maritime transportation, commercial fishing, offshore energy, recreational boating, and search and rescue. In this paper, we estimate the value to the maritime shipping industry of ocean surface wind information and of wind and wave condition forecasts based on this information. Commercial ships transiting the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans are exposed to severe wind and wave conditions associated with extratropical storms. These storms impose costs on maritime commerce by delaying and sometimes damaging vessels or causing loss of cargo. Ocean surface wind information allows ships to limit their exposure to these conditions. We estimate that average expected annual losses to container shipping (lost containers and associated damage to vessels) in the absence of good information about extratropical storm conditions would be on the order of $250 million/year in the North Pacific and $120 million/year in the North Atlantic, and we estimate average expected annual losses to bulk shipping operations from extratropical storm exposure in these regions to be on the order of $150 million/year. A significant fraction of this risk can be avoided with ocean surface vector wind observations and forecasts. Our model results suggest that the QuikSCAT information (available until November 2009) and associated forecasts enabled a reduction in annual exposure for shipping traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific of about 50%, with total annual net savings around $150 million. The estimate of annual benefits to shipping operations from a hypothetical improved satellite instrument is around $200 million.","{""Kite-Powell, Hauke""}","https://doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.45.1.13",2024-04-26 19:18:07,"included",NA,2011,"{}","{""ship routing|extratropical storms|scatterometry|ocean surface wind|value of information""}"

MISR is a unique camera that images Earth's atmosphere and other characteristics simultaneously from nine angles. This multiangle perspective enhances our ability to measure and monitor dimensions of climate, weather, air quality, natural hazards, and the biosphere. ""Societal benefit"" in this paper generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit. The paper has two objectives: to demonstrate how several societal benefit frameworks work, and to highlight some of these benefits in the case of MISR. Such consideration of practical benefits is timely, as their realization is becoming a prominent objective of future space remote sensing activities. At least four groups of experts recommend that societal benefit serve as a heavily weighted criterion for prioritizing Earth science research opportunities. The National Academy of Sciences' forthcoming decadal survey for U.S. Earth science applications from space, the U.S. Climate Change Research Program, the framework for the international Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS), and the new world water program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) all argue that societal benefit should be a determining factor in selecting the next Earth-observing spacecraft missions and instruments. If these recommendations are implemented, the frameworks and illustrations below may prove useful in guiding benefit descriptions in future space-derived Earth observation programs.","{""Macauley, Molly""}","https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.901785",2024-04-22 02:51:43,"included",NA,2006,"{""in benchmarks?""}","{""environmental management|earth observations|earth science"",""societal benefits|resource""}"

This study investigated a new solution for urban air-quality monitoring in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. We developed an observation-based method by combining satellite remote-sensing techniques and a newly established low-cost sensor network to estimate long-term PM2.5 concentrations over Krasnoyarsk, a highly industrialized Siberian city. First, a physical model was developed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using satellite remote-sensing with the aid of ground-based meteorological and radiosonde observations. Observations from the ground-based sensor network were then used to calibrate the deviations in the satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations. The results show that the satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations obtained by our physical model were in good agreement with the sensor observations (R = 0.78 on the monthly scale). The deviation in satellite-derived annual PM2.5 concentrations resulted from data restrictions that occurred at noon and data loss in winter were identified as 20% and 30%, respectively. The regional transport of smoke from forest wildfires increased PM2.5 concentration to 150 μg/m3 in the summer 2018. The average PM2.5 concentrations in the urban districts could reach 35 μg/m3, which far exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guideline. These results underscore the good ability of our new method to determine PM2.5 concentrations in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. Use of sensor and meteorological observations greatly improved satellite detection of PM2.5 concentration. In addition, our method has the potential for global application to improve determination of PM2.5 concentrations, especially in sparsely monitored regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","{""Bilal, M."",""Fung, J.

Its future will depend upon how the systems meet the demand of monitoring global environment; mapping, charting and geodesy; long-term global change research and assessment; monitoring and managing the renewable and non-renewable resources and national security applications. The future Earth Observation Systems (EOS) will have to take into consideration the aspects relate to the globalisation and standardisation of programmes world-over; data continuity and the need to monitor processes rather than events. Technological changes are also going to re-define many of the concepts of observation from space and issues like spatial resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution may no more be a concern for observation systems. In the Indian context, with the launch of IRS-1C, in December 1995, user services have been significantly enhanced. Presently, plans are onway to define the continuity to these missions. A broad analysis has been done of the observation needs of the future and also what has been achieved today and suggestions are made for the future observation systems design and implementation. The need analysis has been done keeping in mind the global change applications; mapping and cartographic applications; natural resources and environmental management applications etc. The paper discusses the strategy adopted for assessing the future requirements and also for defining the future Indian missions. Based on this evaluation and also the need for identifying low-cost, quick turn-around, application specific solutions, candidate payloads for the continuation series have been defined. These candidate payloads cater to a majority of the application needs and specific gap-areas would be taken care of.

The magnitude of events, who they impacted, and the degree to which the events were managed are all, very often, told through the lens of data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such data-driven history, where statistics on infections, death, vaccination, and average mobility are used to tell the story of how the pandemic unfolded in a given locale. While such statistical history is useful, it can also efface the histories of locations that lack access to the proper surveillance infrastructure, or are otherwise unable to deploy it. This produces an erasure of pandemic memory in healthcare-challenged areas, as deaths and infections go unrecorded and undocumented. This paper proposes the use of satellites to correct this, using Earth observation technologies to track viral vectors and find and document mass burial sites to produce a fuller picture of pandemic history, with an emphasis on filling the statistical gaps between the developed and developing world.","{""Gleason, Louis""}","https://ejournals.bc.edu/index.php/orac/article/view/15255",2024-04-28 00:56:38,"included",NA,2022,"{}","{""Pandemics|Tele-Epidemiology|The Spanish Flu|ele-Epidemiology|Healthcare Studies""}"

Managing high priority refuges could improve species resilience and facilitate dispersal during periods of environmental change. In this study, we identified drought refuges in semi-arid Australia for a threatened bird, the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. Using a Poisson regression model, we quantified the effect of remotely sensed vegetation indices, rainfall, soil moisture and site characteristics on malleefowl breeding activity at 144 sites surveyed from 2000 to 2017 during and after drought. We tested the effect of two vegetation productivity indices on malleefowl breeding activity - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - averaged across three temporal and three spatial scales during the mound building and incubation stage of the breeding cycle. We found that NDVI and EVI were better predictors of malleefowl breeding activity than soil moisture and winter rainfall. The model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value contained NDVI averaged over 3 months (June-August) and a 1-km radius. Malleefowl breeding activity had a strong positive association with NDVI (0.42 +/- se 0.03) and a negative association with slope (-0.34 +/- se 0.03) and vegetation patch size (-0.23 +/- se 0.02). We found the proportion of refugia (top 20\% of predicted breeding activity) in protected areas was highly variable, decreasing from 42\% in an extreme wet year (2011) to 14\% in an extreme drought year (2007). Expanding the reserve network to include refugia predicted to occur in the south of semi-arid Victoria could improve resilience of malleefowl to climate change. We demonstrate how remotely sensed vegetation indices combined with citizen science data can identify where to protect native vegetation with high, stable productivity.

6862764,"Integrating Drone Imagery With Existing Rangeland Monitoring Programs","The recent availability of small and low-cost sensor carrying unmanned aerial systems (UAS, commonly known as drones) coupled with advances in image processing software (i.e., structure from motion photogrammetry) has made drone-collected imagery a potentially valuable tool for rangeland inventory and monitoring. Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods.

6863404,"An Evaluation Of The Use Of Remotely Sensed Parameters For Prediction Of Incidence And Risk Associated With Vibrio Parahaemolyticus In Gulf Coast Oysters (Crassostrea Virginica)","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently published a Vibrio parahaemol.y'ticus risk assessment for consumption of raw oysters that predicts V. parahaemolyticus densities at harvest based on water temperature. We retrospectively compared archived remotely sensed measurements (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity) with previously published data from an environmental study of V. parahaemolyticus in Alabama oysters to assess the utility of the former data for predicting V. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters. Remotely sensed sea surface temperature correlated well with previous in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.86) of bottom water temperature, supporting the notion that remotely sensed sea surface temperature data are a sufficiently accurate substitute for direct measurement. Turbidity and chlorophyll levels were not determined in the previous study, but in comparison with the V. parahaemolyticus data, remotely sensed values for these parameters may explain some of the variation in V. parahaemolyticus levels. More accurate determination of these effects and the temporal and spatial variability of these parameters may further improve the accuracy of prediction models. To illustrate the utility of remotely sensed data as a basis for risk management, predictions based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration V. parahaemolyticus risk assessment model were integrated with remotely sensed sea surface temperature data to display graphically variations in V. parahaemolyticus density in oysters associated with spatial variations in water temperature. We believe images such as these could be posted in near real time, and that the availability of such information in a user-friendly format could be the basis for timely and informed risk management decisions.","{""Bowers, J."",""DePaola, A."",""Grimes, D.

6903651,"Predicting Breeding Habitat For Amphibians: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Across Yellowstone National Park","The ability to predict amphibian breeding across landscapes is important for informing land management decisions and helping biologists better understand and remediate factors contributing to declines in amphibian populations. We built geospatial models of likely breeding habitats for each of four amphibian species that breed in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We used field data collected in 2000-2002 from 497 sites among 16 basins and predictor variables from geospatial models produced from remotely sensed data (e. g., digital elevation model, complex topographic index, landform data, wetland probability, and vegetative cover). Except for 31 sites in one basin that were surveyed in both 2000 and 2002, all sites were surveyed once. We used polytomous regression to build statistical models for each species of amphibian from (1) field survey site data only, (2) field data combined with data from geospatial models, and (3) data from geospatial models only. Based on measures of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores, models of the second type best explained likely breeding habitat because they contained the most information (ROC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88). However, models of the third type could be applied to the entire YNP landscape and produced maps that could be verified with reserve field data. Accuracy rates for models built for single years were highly variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.78. Accuracy rates for models built with data combined from multiple years were higher and less variable, ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Combining results from the geospatial multiyear models yielded maps of ""core"" breeding areas (areas with high probability values for all three years) surrounded by areas that scored high for only one or two years, providing an estimate of variability among years. Such information can highlight landscape options for amphibian conservation. For example, our models identify alternative areas that could be protected for each species, including 6828-10 764 ha for tiger salamanders, 971-3017 ha for western toads, 4732-16 696 ha for boreal chorus frogs, and 4940-19 690 ha for Columbia spotted frogs.",NA,"10.1890/10-1261.1",2024-10-03 21:59:25,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA

However, the use of this information in water management decision-making has been lacking. The temporal and spatial scales of forecasts and the difficulty of understanding forecast products have been cited as key reasons for the lack of use of these forecasts. The Community Water Deficit Index (CWDI) was previously developed as a tool to use El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts to forecast droughts in small to mid-sized communities of the southeastern U.S. This study investigated the monetary value and benefits of using CWDI as a seasonal drought forecasting technique. The efforts were focused on determining the usefulness of drought information for municipal water management, the usefulness of water restrictions imposed by municipal water management, and the extent to which advance knowledge of probabilistic drought forecasts mitigates negative impacts. The results indicate that water use restrictions are effective for coping with drought, and the benefits of using forecasts and water management adjustments should involve planning. It was also found that by using drought forecasts, and thus having a drought preparedness plan, communities can save both water and money.","{""Sharda, Vaishali""}","https://doi.org/10.13031/trans.59.11589",2024-04-23 22:22:31,"included",NA,2016,"{}","{""Climate variability|Mitigation|Municipal|Saving|Stakeholder|Water availability|Water management""}"
6691538,"Interactive Model for Assessing Mangrove Health, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, and Satellite Design in Rio de Janeiro Using Earth Observation Data","There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally relevant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary, interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence shing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data, cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1985. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes? This case study is demonstrative of the viability of a similar approach for ecosystems around the world.","{""Reid, Jack""}","https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/129598",2024-04-22 23:40:25,"included",NA,2020,"{maybe}","{""earth observation|model-based systems engineering|mangroves|machine learning|decision support""}"
6863569,"Cross-Scale Sensing Of Field-Level Crop Residue Cover: Integrating Field Photos, Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging, And Satellite Data","Conservation tillage practices can bring benefits to agricultural sustainability. Accurate spatial and temporal resolved information of field-scale crop residue cover, which reflects tillage intensity, is highly valuable for evaluating the outcomes of government conservation programs and voluntary ecosystem service markets, as well as facilitating agroecosystem modeling to quantify cropland biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing has the potential to cost-effectively detect crop residue cover, however, existing regional-scale studies were limited by insufficient ground truth data, scale mismatch between coarse satellite pixels and ground data, and the lack of key spectral data for detecting crop residues. Therefore, this study developed an innovative cross-sensing framework to integrate proximal sensing, airborne hyperspectral imaging, and satellite Earth Observation through deep learning to quantify field-level crop residue cover fractions at the regional scale. Specifically, we have collected intensive ground orthographic photos and conducted airborne hyperspectral surveys at corn and soybean fields of Champaign and nearby counties in Illinois, the heartland of the U.S. Corn Belt. Through semi-automatic labeling aided by ResNet-50 and superpixel image segmentation, we obtained 6719 records of ground residue fractions. With these ground data, we developed the 1-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) model using airborne hyperspectral reflectance, which has 0.5 m spatial resolution and 3–5 nm spectral resolution from 400 to 2400 nm, to predict residue fractions. By applying the CNN model to airborne pixels, we augmented “ground truth” data of crop residues and further combined them with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) satellite data to quantify regional residue fractions at 30 m resolution. Results show that airborne hyperspectral imagery with CNN can accurately detect residue fractions (R2 = 0.82, relative RMSE = 11.73%) to effectively generate quasi “ground truth” data to support satellite upscaling to all fields. With independent ground data for testing, we found that the ground-airborne-satellite integrative framework achieved better predictions in estimating crop residue cover (R2 = 0.67, relative RMSE = 17.53%) than the conventional ground-satellite upscaling (R2 = 0.22, relative RMSE = 32.09%). We also found that the shortwave infrared wavelengths, particularly 2100–2300 nm, are vital for predicting crop residue cover. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data have a comparable capability to track residue fractions due to similar shortwave infrared wavelengths. This study highlights the high accuracy of hyperspectral imaging to detect agroecosystem tillage management practices and the advantages of cross-scale sensing to cost-effectively integrate multi-source data to quantify field-level agroecosystem variables across scales. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","{""Guan, K."",""Huang, Y."",""Jiang, C."",""Li, K."",""Li, Z."",""Ma, Z."",""Mei, W."",""Peng, B."",""Wang, S."",""Wang, S."",""Wu, X."",""Yang, Y."",""Zhang, C."",""Zhou, Q."",""Zhou, W.""}","10.1016/j.rse.2022.113366",2024-07-12 23:20:44,"included",NA,2023,"{}","{""Agricultural wastes"",""Airborne hyperspectral imaging"",Convolution,""Convolutional neural network"",""Convolutional neural networks"",""Corn Belt"",""Crop residue"",Crops,""Deep learning"",Ecosystems,Forecasting,""Hyperspectral imaging"",""Image segmentation"",Landsat,""Multi-scale remote sensing"",Multi-scales,""Neural network models"",Pixels,""Remote sensing"",Remote-sensing,ResNet-50,Sentinel-2,Spectroscopy,""Sustainable agriculture"",""Tillage practices"",""United States"",""agricultural ecosystem"",""ecosystem service"",""satellite data"",""spatial resolution"",""spectral resolution""}"
6863076,"Satellite Sensors And Retrieval Algorithms Of Atmospheric Methane","Significance Global climate governance and greenhouse gas emission reduction are of great urgency. The volume fraction of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been rising continuously since the industrial revolution and is now averaging about 1895.7x10(-9) globally. In addition, since the global warming potential of CH4 is about 27-30 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), the monitoring of atmospheric CH4 becomes the focus and hotspot of carbon emission reduction. Satellite remote sensing features fast detection speed, wide coverage, and rich information. It can conduct continuous and stable observations of atmospheric CH4 with high temporal and spatial resolution and high precision on a global scale and can provide verification and support for the ""bottom-up"" emission inventory. Relying on the rapid development of satellite detection technology and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a large number of satellites with CH4 detection capabilities have emerged in the past two decades. The detection technology has become more mature with increasingly higher detection accuracy. Additionally, corresponding algorithms of various satellite sensors have also made a huge leap forward. Rapid advances in both sensors and algorithms enable us to better monitor the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric CH4 and its impact on climate change. With the purpose to promote the further development of CH4 satellite remote sensing and retrieval research and realize the dual carbon target, it is necessary to summarize and discuss the existing research progress and future development trends, which can provide scientific and technological support for China's low-carbon sustainable development. Progress Firstly, the development of atmospheric CH4 satellites and sensors is reviewed and introduced. Early sensors mainly rely on the thermal infrared band of about 8 mu m for CH4 detection, and typical representatives include IMG, AIRS, and IASI (Table 1). Subsequently, a series of passive short-wave infrared sensors represented by SCIAMACHY, TANSO-FTS, and TROPOMI are developed. They rely on CH4 characteristic bands near 1.6 mu m and 2.3 mu m for detection and are more sensitive to changes in near-surface CH4 concentration. Among them, the high-resolution imaging spectral sensors and platforms represented by GHGSat, AHSI, and MethaneSAT also take advantage of their high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution to monitor the CH4 point source emissions. There is no doubt that new energy is injected into the development of CH4 satellite remote sensing (Table 2). In recent years, active detection represented by the methane remote sensing lidar mission (MERLIN) has also developed rapidly, effectively making up for the shortcomings of passive remote sensing detection with improved detection efficiency. Subsequently, the principles, application conditions, and retrieval accuracy of different sensor algorithms are summarized. From the early DOAS algorithm, proxy algorithm, and PPDF algorithm, to the most commonly employed full-physical algorithm with the highest precision at this stage, the physical algorithms have been continuously improved with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. The full-physical algorithms represented by NIES-FP, UoL-FP, RemoTeC, RemoTAP, IAPCAS, and FOCAL have an accuracy of 6x10(-9). At the same time, with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence, various new algorithms, such as neural network algorithms, are also emerging, which can almost complete the real-time retrieval of CH4. These methods have also brought breakthroughs to CH4 retrieval. Conclusions and Prospects In the future, CH4 detection satellite sensors will continue to develop toward the goal of high temporal and spatial resolution, high precision, high accuracy, and continuous observation. Many high- performance satellites such as MethaneSAT, Sentinel-5, and CO2M are under planning (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the construction of the satellite network should be stepped up to meet the demands of CH4 global high-precision detection. Correspondingly, new requirements are put forward for the accuracy, coverage, and calculation speed of CH4 observation data and retrieval products. For the most accurate full- physical algorithm at present, the adoption of more accurate forward radiative transfer models and prior information, collaborative retrieval and correction of clouds and aerosols, and multi-satellite joint retrieval and verification are all important means for algorithm improvement. With the accelerated global climate governance and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, more and more countries have formulated and implemented a series of CH4 emission reduction measures, and China has also proposed the dual carbon target, which is steadily advancing. However, the issues of climate governance and carbon emissions are very complex, and to some extent have even become the focus of competition among countries. In this context, the development of China's atmospheric CH4 satellite remote sensing cannot be slackened and should be highly valued and vigorously developed to seize opportunities. China has deployed the launch of the next-generation carbon satellite task, which will implement the main passive observation, and significantly broaden the range of detection time and space. Finally, the spatial and temporal resolution is improved to promote an effective amount of data and realize the full range of high-precision detection, thus providing a solid foundation and strong support for realizing a dual carbon target.","{""Fan Cheng"",""Gu Haoran"",""Han Yinghui"",""He Zhuo"",""Li Zhengqiang"",""Ma Jinji"",""Qin Kai"",""Shi Zheng"",""Xu Wenbin"",""Zhang Hao"",""Zhang Ying"",""Zhang Yuanxun"",""Zheng Yang"",""Zhu Jun"",""Zuo Jinhui""}","10.3788/aos230429",2024-07-13 00:11:04,"included",NA,2023,"{}","{""atmospheric remote sensing; sensors; carbon emission reduction; greenhouse gas; methane; retrieval a""}"

Snow-Covered Area (SCA) is an important hydrologic variable for both volumetric and daily stream flow forecasting. Satellite data provide the ideal way to map snow cover in mountain regions; however, the utility of these datasets have been limited due to the large number of scenes that are contaminated with cloud cover.

6903514,"Crop Dominance Mapping With Irs-P6 And Modis 250-M Time Series Data","This paper describes an approach to accurately separate out and quantify crop dominance areas in the major command area in the Krishna River Basin. Classification was performed using IRS-P6 (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, series P6) and MODIS eight-day time series remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 23.6 m, 250 m for the year 2005. Temporal variations in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) pattern obtained in crop dominance classes enables a demarcation between long duration crops and short duration crops. The NDVI pattern was found to be more consistent in long duration crops than in short duration crops due to the continuity of the water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release, which affected the time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was, in turn, reflected in the NDVI pattern. The identified crop-wise classes were tested and verified using ground-truth data and state-level census data. The accuracy assessment was performed based on ground-truth data through the error matrix method, with accuracies from 67\% to 100\% for individual crop dominance classes, with an overall accuracy of 79\% for all classes. The derived major crop land areas were highly correlated with the sub-national statistics with R-2 values of 87\% at the mandal (sub-district) level for 2005-2006. These results suggest that the methods, approaches, algorithms and datasets used in this study are ideal for rapid, accurate and large-scale mapping of paddy rice, as well as for generating their statistics over large areas. This study demonstrates that IRS-P6 23.6-m one-time data fusion with MODIS 250-m time series data is very useful for identifying crop type, the source of irrigation water and, in the case of surface water irrigation, the way in which it is applied. The results from this study have assisted in improving surface water and groundwater irrigated areas of the command area and also provide the basis for better water resource assessments at the basin scale.",NA,"10.3390/agriculture4020113",2024-09-27 23:22:04,"included",NA,NA,"{}",NA
6862949,"Automatic Parameter Optimization For Support Vector Regression For Land And Sea Surface Temperature Estimation From Remote Sensing Data","Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities For many, environmental models. Remote sensing is a source of information for their estimation on both regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been devised to estimate LST and SST from satellite data, most of which require a priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can subsequently he used to estimate unknown surface temperatures from additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper, a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to quasi-optimal values in the sense of minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the ""span-bound"" upper bound on the leave-one-out (1,00) error) which can be computed by using only the training set, without need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, Powell's algorithm is adopted, since it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results yielded by the proposed method are similar in accuracy to those achieved by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration which yields the best test-set accuracy. However, the proposed method gives a dramatic reduction in the computational time required, particularly when many training samples are available.","{""Moser, Gabriele"",""Serpico, Sebastiano B.""}","10.1109/tgrs.2008.2005993",2024-07-17 21:18:45,"included",NA,2009,"{maybe,""reduced comp time"",algorithm}","{""Generalization error bounds; land surface temperature (LST); Powell's method; sea surface temperatur""}"

Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, the decline in farmer welfare does not require an expansion in expected supply. Better weather information may signal farmers to produce less on average under an inelastic demand.

However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis. The six dimensions are described in the paper and have been tested on a significant number of recent cases.

However, there is a cost for monitoring water quality.\nIn this article, we show, for the first time, how the estimation of the Economic Value of Information (EVOI) can be used to determine the spatio-temporal design of the network. With the example of a network that aims to detect accidental pollution, we show how to calculate the EVOI according to the spatial and temporal network design (number and location of stations, temporal accuracy of measurement) and how to define this design by maximizing the EVOI. This will allow us to answer questions such as: Are the expenses invested in the networks justified?

However, the practical use of SCF in Europe is still fairly recent and, as such, current knowledge of the added benefits of SCF in supporting and improving decision-making is limited. This study is based on research conducted to co-develop a semi-operational climate service prototype – the Land Management Tool (LMTool) – with farmers in South West regions of the UK. The value of the SCF provided to the farmers was examined to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farmers' decisions during the winter months of 2015/2016. The findings from the study point to the need to explore and develop (new) research methods capable of addressing the complexity of the decision-making processes, such as those in the farming sector. The farmers who used the SCF perceived it as useful and usable as it helped them change and adapt their decision-making and thus, avoid unnecessary costs. However, to fully grasp the potential value of using SCF, farmers emphasised the need for the provision of SCF for longer periods of time to allow them to build trust and confidence in the information provided. This paper contributes to ongoing discussions about how to assess the use and value of SCF in decision-making processes in a meaningful and effective way.","{""Bruno Soares, Marta""}","https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-14-175-2017",2024-04-25 02:28:35,"included",NA,2017,"{}",NA
6863184,"Grassland Wildfires In The Southern Great Plains: Monitoring Ecological Impacts And Recovery","Devastating wildfires in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas in 2016 and 2017 resulted in significant social, economic, and environmental losses, with the agricultural sector among those severely affected. Several satellite-based indices were evaluated as potential monitoring tools for post-wildfire ecological recovery and management of grasslands. All indices evaluated provided useful information and indicated rapid vegetation recovery from wildfire. The Leaf Water Stress Index (LSWI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) showed a distinct response to the wildfire events, and differentiated between burned and unburned areas throughout the post-wildfire growing seasons better than the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI). In particular, the LSWI may provide a useful tool for mapping the footprint of wildfire, with potential utility for organizations that provide post-fire recovery resources. The GPP, which estimates the biomass productivity of vegetation, can provide information to livestock operators to guide the re-stocking of cattle in the aftermath of wildfire. In sum, satellite-based proxies can provide timely information both to characterize a wildfire's footprint and to guide post-fire grazing management in a manner that balances short term needs for forage with long-term productivity and ecological function.","{""Brown, David"",""Robertson, Shelby"",""Steiner, Jean L."",""Teet, Stephen"",""Wang, Jie"",""Wetter, Jeffrey"",""Wu, Xiaocui"",""Xiao, Xiangming"",""Zhou, Yuting""}","10.3390/rs12040619",2024-07-15 16:02:36,"included",NA,2020,"{}","{""NDVI; EVI; LSWI; GPP; vegetative productivity model; prairie; rangeland; ranching; wildlife; disaste""}"
6691551,"A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations in wildland fire suppression decisions","A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations is proposed and deployed. The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphere–fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexico’s 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made. We analysed the impact of Earth observations and include considerations for estimating other socioeconomic impacts.","{""Herr, Vincent""}","https://doi.org/10.1071/WF18237",2024-04-23 22:34:32,"included",NA,2020,"{}","{""fire economics|fire management|fire modelling|fire sumulation modelling|remote sensing|socioeconomic""}"
