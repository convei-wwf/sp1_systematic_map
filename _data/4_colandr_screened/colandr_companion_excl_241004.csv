6863695,"Understanding Large-Scale Deforestation In Southern Jinotega, Nicaragua From 1978 To 1999 Through The Examination Of Changes In Land Use And Land Cover","Nicaragua, home to the largest remaining extent of rainforest in Central America (total surface area) and to a significant indigenous population, has lost approximately half of its forest cover since 1950. This major and rapid loss of forest cover has been explained as the consequence of an eastward moving agricultural frontier that cuts through the region of Jinotega. If the current deforestation rate continues, the country could lose its remaining forest cover over the course of the next two decades; therefore, it is essential that the dynamics and relationships of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) in this region are understood. To examine LUCC in Nicaragua over time, Landsat imagery from the southern portion of the region of Jinotega, taken in 1978, 1987, and 1999 was utilized. A remote-sensing method, supervised classification, which allows for the grouping of spectrally similar values for each year, followed by an image change detection analysis (postclassification comparison) was conducted. Groundtruthing (field validation) was conducted in 2006 to validate the data, which yielded increasing overall accuracy rates of 71.68% for 1978, 82.35% for 1987, and 84.38% for 1999. The classification and change detection results showed that if the agricultural cultivation overtook this region, it happened before 1978. Therefore, the possibility that either deforestation did not actually occur along an agricultural frontier or that it was located further east exists; this would be an interesting subject for future studies. There was, however, clear evidence of increased forest cover from 1987 to 1999 near the urban center, correlating with the enforced reforestation law in the city of Jinotega. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

6862729,"Comparison Of Petiole Nitrate Concentrations, Spad Chlorophyll Readings, And Quickbird Satellite Imagery In Detecting Nitrogen Status Of Potato Canopies","Nitrogen (N) management is critical in optimizing potato yield and quality and reducing environmental pollution. Six N rates from 34 to 270 kg ha(-1), and different timing of N application were used in a 3-year field experiment to contrast SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter and QuickBird satellite imagery data against the conventional petiole sampling technique for assessing canopy N status. Overall treatment variations in SPAD readings were consistent with those in petiole nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. However, the ability of the SPAD meter to detect treatment differences varied with growth stage and growing season. Severe N deficiency was detected about I month after emergence with SPAD readings, but as early as 2 weeks after emergence with petiole NO3-N concentrations. Petiole NO3-N concentrations tended to differentiate more treatment variations than SPAD readings at all growth stages except at hilling. N deficiency was detected with QuickBird image-derived vegetation indices (VIs) at the hilling stage in 2002, but not in 2003. At the post-hilling stage, treatment differences in VI values were minimal and insignificant except very late in the growing season. SPAD meters could be used as an indirect method for detecting N deficiency at the hilling stage when making supplemental N applications, but they are not as sensitive as the petiole sampling method. The sensitivity of QuickBird imagery to canopy N variations needs to be further tested with more pixel data. However, cloud interference and high cost of images could limit the use of QuickBird data in making timely management decisions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

6863523,"Application Of The Metric Model For Mapping Evapotranspiration Over The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India","This study is an attempt to estimate the spatial distribution of daily evapotranspiration (ET) in the Indian part of the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve by utilizing the (Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high resolution with internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. Landsat 8 OLI satellite image was used to run the METRIC model and calculate ET to explain the overall surface energy balance in the area under the present climatic conditions. The result obtained shows that, the ET minimum value ranges from 6.874 mm/day in cropland to a maximum of 12.321 mm/day in the forest and water bodies. We used a (ETrF) value of 1 for forests since the forest surface temperature was lower than the air temperature, resulting in a negative sensible heat flow. The use of METRIC energy balancing procedures for validation purposes using Landsat imagery shows that the per hourly, monthly, and yearly ET estimations acquired using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer) data may be effectively reproduced. The research includes a novel component that verifies the efficacy of this technique for water conservation, as well as satellite-based technology, which offers effective and efficient tools for integrated evapotranspiration estimation.","{""De, Aakash"",""De, Tarun Kumar"",""Mondal, Ismail"",""Thakur, Sandeep""}","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108553",2024-07-17 19:23:58,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{calibration}","{""SEBAL; Remote Sensing; LST; Vegetation 's model; METRIC; Evapotranspiration""}"
6862994,"Effect Of An Environmental Flow On Vegetation Growth And Health Using Ground And Remote Sensing Metrics","Understanding the effectiveness of environmental flow deliveries along rivers requires monitoring vegetation. Monitoring data are often collected at multiple spatial scales. For riparian vegetation, optical remote sensing methods can estimate growth responses at the riparian corridor scale, and field-based measures can quantify species composition; however, the extent to which these different measures are duplicative or complementary is important to understand when planning monitoring programmes with limited resources. In this study, we analysed riparian vegetation growth in the delta of the Colorado River in response to an experimental pulse flow. Our goal was to compare ground-based measurements of vegetation structure and composition with satellite-based Landsat radiometric variables, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We made this comparison in 21 transects following the delivery of 131.8 million cubic meters (mcm) of water in the stream channel during the spring of 2014 as a pulse flow and 38.4 mcm as base flows. Vegetation cover increased 14\% and NDVI increased 0.02 (15\%) by October 2015, and both variables returned to pre-pulse flow values in October 2016. Observed changes in vegetation structure and composition did not persist after the second year. The highest increase in vegetation cover in October 2014 and October 2015 resulted from species that could respond rapidly to additional water such as reeds (Arundo donax and Phragmites australis), cattail (Typha domingensis), and herbaceous plants. Dominant shrubs, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea), both indicative of nonrestored habitats showed variable increases in cover, and native trees (Salicaceae family) presented low increases (1\%). The strong NDVI-vegetation cover relationship indicates that NDVI is appropriate to detect changes at the riparian corridor scale but needs to be complemented with ground data to determine the contributions by different species to the observed trends.","{""Flessa, Karl W."",""Glenn, Edward P."",""Gomez-Sapiens, Martha M."",""Jarchow, Christopher J."",""Nagler, Pamela L."",""Shafroth, Patrick B.""}","10.1002/hyp.13689",2024-07-17 18:35:34,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{comparison}","{""Colorado River Delta; cover NDVI; environmental flow; riparian monitoring; vegetation structure""}"
6863549,"Coastal Wetlands Of The Northern Gulf Of California: Inventory And Conservation Status","1. Above 28 degrees N, the coastline of the northern Gulf of California is indented Lit frequent intervals by negative or inverse estuaries that are saltier at their backs than at their Mouths due to the lack of freshwater inflow. These 'esteros' total over 215000 ha in area and encompass mangrove marshes below 29 degrees N and saltgrass (Distichlis palmeri) marshes north of 29 degrees N. An additional 6000 ha of freshwater and brackish wetlands are found in the Colorado River delta where fresh water enters the interticial zone. 2. The mangrove marshes in the Gulf of California have been afforded some degree of protected status in Mexico, but the northern saltgrass esteros do not have priority conservation status and are increasingly becoming development targets for resorts, vacation homes and aquaculture sites. 3. We conducted an inventory of the marshes using aerial photography and satellite images, and evaluated the extent and type of development on each marsh. We reviewed the available literature on the marshes to document their vegetation types, and ecological functions in the adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems. 4. Over 95\% of the mangrove marshes have been developed for shrimp fanning. However, the farms are built adjacent to, rather than in, the marshes, and the mangrove stands are still mostly intact. 5. The majority of saltgrass marshes above the mangrove line are still relatively unspoiled. However, resort and Vacation home development is taking place on land Surrounding them. 6. We recommend a system of protected reserves incorporating the pristine wetlands, along with water quality management and buffer zones For the more developed esteros. The saltgrass marshes should be considered for conservation protection, similar to the protection given to the Southern mangrove marshes whose Value has already been recognized.

Due to rapid socio-economic and environmental changes, the role of biodiversity and ecosystems for human health ought to be examined and communicated to decision-makers and the public. We therefore summarized the lessons and recommendations from an interdisciplinary conference convened in Cambodia in 2014 to advise Southeast Asian societies on current research efforts, future research needs, and to provide suggestions for improved education, training and science-policy interactions. First, we reviewed several examples of the important role of ecosystems as 'sentinels' in the sense that potentially harmful developments for human health become first apparent in ecosystem components. Other ecosystem services which also benefit human well-being are briefly summarized. Second, we summarized the recommendations of the conference's roundtable discussions and added recent developments in the science-policy interface. The recommendations were organized along five themes: Ethical and legal considerations; implementation of the One Health approach; education, training, and capacity building; future research priorities; and potential science-policy interactions. While the role of biodiversity for human health needs further research, especially for zoonoses and emerging diseases, many direct and indirect benefits to human health are already apparent, but have yet to filter down to the science-policy interface in order to influence legislation and enforcement. Therefore, efforts to strengthen the interface in Southeast Asia should become a high priority in order to strengthen the health and resilience of Southeast Asian societies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","{""Binot, A."",""Boëte, C."",""By, Y."",""Cappelle, J."",""Carrique-Mas, J."",""Chou, M."",""Furey, N."",""Kim, S."",""Lajaunie, C."",""Lek, S."",""Morand, S."",""Méral, P."",""Neang, M."",""Tan, B.

6863213,"Advanced Warning Method For Aircraft Landing Risk Under Air –Ground Data Real-Time Transmission Conditions","At present, the flight safety work of civil aviation in China mainly investigates the probable causes of accidents and analyzes flight data after air accidents, causing numerous problems such as passive safety management and delayed risk control. To realize the early warning of flight risk during flight, a dynamic method for the evaluation of landing risk and early warning under the condition of future air –ground data real-time transmission was proposed. The landing stage, which has the most complex operation program and the highest accident rate during a flight, was taken as the research object, and future air-to-ground high-throughput interconnection scenarios comprising 5G and satellite networks were considered to solve the problem of advanced intelligent warnings and aircraft alarms in abnormal flights. First, according to the accident causation theory, the human factor reliability model, the system model, and other theories or models, a landing warning index system based on multisource real-time operation data and the integration of historical statistics and expert knowledge was established. Then, a grounding parameter prediction model was established to solve the problem of lag in the acquisition of four grounding parameters, namely ground pitch angle, ground speed, ground vertical rate, and 50 ft-ground horizontal flight distance in actual flight. This model classified the pilot’s landing operation mode by clustering ARJ21 historical landing data and determined the attribute mean value of the four parameters for each type of operation mode. Furthermore, according to decision field theory, the model discussed the landing mode selection of pilots with different personalities in different scenarios and calculated the selection probability of the pilot’s landing operation mode, thereby obtaining the predicted values of the four above-mentioned indicators. According to the above, aiming at the complexity and uncertainty of the landing risk early warning system, a reasoning method of the multilayer confidence rule base was proposed. This method improved the traditional reasoning method of the single-layer confidence rule base and adopted the bottom-up hierarchical reasoning method considering the complexity characteristics of the landing process, effectively integrating different sources and forms of qualitative or quantitative data. Thus, the dynamic assessment and reasoning of the landing risk were realized. Finally, using the reasoning-based calculation of the landing process for the “2020.10.16 Panzhihua runway grounding event” and “2010.8.2 Yichun air disaster,” the results verified the effectiveness of the method. It was found that the early warning time of the Panzhihua event can reach 13 s. © 2023 Science Press.

6863266,"A Comprehensive Survey On Gnss Interferences And The Application Of Neural Networks For Anti-Jamming","In recent years, modern systems are highly reliant on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as reliable positioning, navigation, and timing services have become crucial in many safety-critical, security, and emergency applications. Although GNSS technology offers precise and global positioning and navigation, the GNSS signals are susceptible to intentional and unintentional Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) as the signal strength is weak when they reach the receiver. Hence, the receiver's performance gets degraded as the interference signal may cause navigation error or saturate the receiver's operation. Therefore, the research on interference mitigation is of high interest to the GNSS community and is emerging rapidly. In order to have a beneficial and extensive outlook, an in-depth survey on GNSS interferences and the application of metaheuristic based neural networks for interference cancellation has been presented in this paper; with an emphasis on one of the major GNSS threats i.e. jamming. Various solutions adopted by the researchers to cope up with the interference have been surveyed and presented. Also, to have a more intuitive insight, a comparative analysis of the existing mitigating techniques has been summarized. In addition, the review focuses on the neural network approach for anti-jamming and also discusses the implementation strategy of particle swarm optimization based back propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN) to address the shortcomings of traditional training algorithms. Finally, the future aspects to further enhance the neural network algorithms for anti-jamming have also been provided for the benefit of researchers.","{""Lorraine, Kambham Jacob Silva"",""Ramarakula, Madhu""}","10.1080/03772063.2021.1953407",2024-10-03 17:33:56,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2023,"{}","{""Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS); Jamming; Navigation; Neural networks; Radio frequency int""}"

6862780,"Research On Anti-Shadow Tree Detection Method Based On Generative Adversarial Network","High-scoring remote sensing imaging has widely been applied in most management of agriculture and forestry, especially to monitor and evaluate crops and forest resources on a large scale. Nevertheless, there is a great challenge to the accuracy of single tree identification and detection during the image acquisition, due mainly to the fact that the shadow area is inevitably formed by the light. The shadow areas in the remote sensing images can be assumed as a kind of noise in the image sampling. As such, the degradation of high-resolution parameters can cause image distortion after post-processing. In this study, an anti-shadow tree detection method was proposed to detect the single tree with shadow interference using a generative adversarial network (GA-Faster RCNN). This framework consisted of a Faster RCNN network and a tree generator. The Faster RCNN network was mainly used for the tasks of feature extraction and detection. The tree generator was utilized to process the shadows in tree detection. The adversarial generation strategy was adopted by the tree generator to learn generating the minimum feature information characterizing trees. The generator was first trained separately and then put into the Faster RCNN network to finally lock its parameters. Two parts were then trained end-to-end to further improve the tree recognition ability of the network. The GA-Faster RCNN was also compared with 3 state-of-the-art methods, including region-growing, progressive cascaded convolutional neural network, and Faster RCNN on three test areas with shadows. Test area 1 presented a lot of shadows of trees, where the canopy density of trees was very high. Test area 2 showed fewer tree shadows and lower canopy closure, compared with test area 1. The shades of trees and the canopy density of trees in test area 3 were between those in test area 1 and 2. Results demonstrated that the GA-Faster RCNN achieved the highest harmonic average of precision and recall (F1) on the test area 1, 2, and 3, which were 78.4%, 91.6%, and 81.7%, respectively. The average F1 of three test areas was 84.7% for the GA-Faster RCNN, 6.2 percentage point higher than that of Faster RCNN. The user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) of GA-Faster RCNN were also the highest among four methods, where UA was 79.8%, 95.0%, 85.3%, and PA was 77.0%, 88.5%, and 78.4% on test area 1, 2, 3, respectively. Moreover, a significance analysis, McNemar, was performed to eliminate the interference of experimental errors and other factors. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference between the three comparison methods and GA-Faster RCNN. The shadow misrecognition rate SR (proportion of the count of shadows misrecognized as trees to the count of total recognized trees) of GA-Faster RCNN was compared with that of Faster RCNN on test area 1, in order to clarify the effect of the mask on tree identification. Although the SR of GA-Faster RCNN was 13.8%, higher than that of Faster RCNN (8.6%), the UA and the number of missed tree identification were both better than those of Faster RCNN. Therefore, the GA-Faster RCNN behaved significant advantages over the other identification. In addition, the GA-Faster RCNN can still maintain the detection stability, when using different feature extraction networks, including ResNet101, ResNet50, and DenseNet. Consequently, the adversarial generative training strategy is highly suitable for learning the minimum feature information characterizing trees, while effectively reducing the interference of shadows, indicating the promising practical value for higher accuracy of tree detection. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

6863499,"Evaluating The Eco-Environment Benefit Of Land Reclamation In The Dump Of An Opencast Coal Mine","Land reclamation significantly affects the ecological and environmental conditions of mining areas. However, quantifying the exact effects is difficult because of the lack of reliable data. The estimation of eco-environment benefit contributes to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by land reclamation and to provide useful information for policy-makers concerned with sustainable development. The aim of this study is to investigate variations in eco-environment benefit in response to land use changes during land reclamation. The West dump, one of the earliest regions to implement ecological restoration in Liaoning Province, is selected as the study area. The widely used methods for eco-environment benefits based on the land use change were proposed and applied to the West dump in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The total eco-environment benefits in study areas were 0.98 million dollars in 2004, 1.39 million dollars in 2009, and 1.43 million dollars in 2014, with an increase of 0.41 million dollars from 2004 to 2009 mainly because of the increasing areas of artificial woodland and reclaimed cropland. The combined eco-environment benefits of artificial woodland, improved grassland, and reclaimed cropland were over 90\% of the total benefits. Soil formation and protection, biodiversity protection, and gas regulation were the top three functions with high eco-environment benefits, contributing about half of the total eco-environment benefits. The results suggest that future studies estimating eco-environment benefits should pay more attention to ecosystems in fragile ecological regions where various human interferences happen frequently. All of the abovementioned results made the techniques of estimation of the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation are more meaningful in guiding the future exploitation and reclamation of mining areas.","{""Wang, Jing"",""Wang, Qiubing"",""Wei, Zhongyi""}","10.1080/02757540.2017.1337103",2024-07-16 23:28:09,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""Land reclamation; eco-environment benefit; remote sensing; valuation""}"

This study uses satellite RS and meteorological-based drought indicators to assess drought risk in the Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Data analysis included the retrieval of vegetation conditions using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) were calculated to account for climatic variabilities. Results revealed that the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient decreased by -2 dB in the cropland area, indicating crop growth irregularities compared to grassland areas. These irregularities were supported by Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) strong fluctuations during the two-year observation period. A significant coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.60) between the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient and Sentinel-2 NDVI was observed for the study area. On the one hand, only KBDI significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.60) with the cropland area's RS data-derived drought indicators. These results revealed RS data variability for drought risk management but are still valuable for developing an early warning system.","{""Alonzo, Christian Albert"",""Galabay, Joanna Mae"",""Macatangay, Margadrew Nicole"",""Magpayo, Mark Brianne"",""Ramirez, Ryan""}","10.3390/agriengineering5020045",2024-07-12 23:22:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""drought; remote sensing; Sentinel-1 SAR data; Sentinel-2 optical data; Ilocos Norte""}"

6903541,"Development Of A Water Quality Management Model For Dry Rivers In Arid Regions: Application On Wadi Rumah, Saudi Arabia","In dry rivers, urban wastewater discharge forms a pond in the dry period, and surface runoff shapes a longer pond in the wet period. A water quality management model developed for dry rivers is applied on Wadi Rumah in Saudi Arabia. The sub-basin was delineated from 30-m x 30-m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Hydrologic loss, runoff rates, and time of concentration were determined using the soil conservation service curve number, soil conservation service unit hydrograph methods, and Kirpich formula. Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System estimated the wet weather flows for 10 low-to-medium rainfall events. A steady-state hydrodynamic model including river flows, effluent discharge, and evaporation and infiltration losses estimated the hydraulic retention time for the explicit case of ponding conditions of dry rivers. Mass balance and first-order kinetics modeled the physical (total dissolved solid and total suspended solid), chemical (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, NH3, PO4, and Cl2), and microbiological (total coliform and fecal coliform) parameters. The hydrodynamic model and biokinetic rate coefficients were calibrated with satellite images, reported literature, and field measurements. A water quality index compared the aggregated water quality against the standards for 4 intended uses. The study yields ""very good"" water quality for restricted and unrestricted irrigation for the dry period, ""fair"" for livestock drinking, and ""marginal"" for fishery and recreation for the dry period, while water quality remained ""marginal"" for all the uses in the wet period.

The samples collected from the reservoir were categorized into three different groups (storage port, transition region and main reservoir area), the absorption coefficients (a(355) and a*(355)) had a decrease process from the storage port to main reservoir area, while the S value exhibited an increased trend. Meanwhile, significantly negative correlations of the value of S240-500 were found with a(355) and a*(355), respectively, which may have implications for the remote sensing estimation of CDOM in this study. A significantly negative correlation between a(355) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was conducive to the establishment of DOC remote sensing inversion model, and relationships between a(355) and aph(440) implied the potential contribution of phytoplankton metabolism and degradation products to the CDOM pool in the Zhoucun Reservoir.

6447820,"Conserving ecosystem services and biodiversity: Measuring the tradeoffs involved in splitting conservation budgets","Conservation organizations increasingly target ecosystem services alongside biodiversity, yet it remains unclear whether ecosystem service goals reinforce or detract from those for biodiversity. We assess tradeoffs between biodiversity and ecosystem services and test the hypothesis that the severity of this tradeoff is a function the breadth of taxa and ecosystem services targeted. We identify optimal conserved lands networks for four taxa, four ecosystem services, and all possible combinations of each. We then assess the amount of biodiversity and ecosystem service contained within each network, its conservation cost, and its overlap with every other network. We find that overlap varies widely across individual ecosystem services and taxa, and that networks targeting multiple services contain more biodiversity than networks targeting a single service. Safeguarding a given amount of ecosystem service and biodiversity through joint optimization requires a 13% increase in conservation budgets relative to achieving targets for biodiversity alone, and results in a 22% budget savings relative to achieving targets for each though separate efforts. We conclude that including ecosystem services goals alongside those for biodiversity is likely have a net positive impact on biodiversity, especially when a broad suite of services are targeted.","{""Galford, Gillian L."",""Ricketts, Taylor H."",""Sonter, Laura J."",""Watson, Keri B.""}","10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101063",NA,NA,NA,2020,"{}","{Biodiversity,""Conservation planning"",""Ecosystem services""}"
6863065,"Spatial Distribution Of Xco2 Using Oco-2 Data In Growing Seasons","The purpose of this research is to assess the spatial distribution of CO2 concentration during the growing seasons (April to September) in 2015 over Iran. The XCO2 data belonging to orbiting carbon observatory-2 (OCO-2) and eight environmental variables data consist of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), net primary productivity (NPP), land surface temperature (LST), leaf area index (LAI), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and national land cover map were modeled by multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The values of R2 and RMSE indices show the good performance of the multi-layer perceptron model for monthly models. Based on sensitivity analysis results, land cover and wind direction had the most important role in the spatial distribution of XCO2. Also, the results revealed that the maximum values of XCO2 observed in the east, south east, and desert areas in central of Iran due to the lack of vegetation cover, lack of local wind current, and high temperature. The western, northwestern and northern regions of Iran have the minimum amounts of XCO2 because of existing valuable ecosystem such as Hyrcanian and Zagrous forests, rangeland, air currents, and low temperature. The findings of this study indicated that the manageable factors such as land cover and vegetation cover play very important roles in the spatial distribution of CO2 and finding carbon dioxide source and sink at national scale. Therefore, policymakers and managers by the logical management of these resources are able to control or even reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in different areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","{""Alavi, S.

6863282,"Investing In Nature: Restoring Coastal Habitat Blue Infrastructure And Green Job Creation","This study examines the economic impact of the expenditures from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administered for coastal habitat restoration projects around the United States. Estimates of the total jobs created as well as the average number of jobs created per million dollars spent are provided. The study shows that the 50 ARRA projects administered by NOAA in the first year and half generated a total of 1409 jobs. These habitat restoration projects created, on average, 17 jobs per million dollars spent which is similar to other conservation industries such as parks and land conservation, and much higher than other traditional industries including coal, gas, and nuclear energy generation. This suggests that habitat restoration is indeed an effective way to stimulate job creation. In addition, habitat restoration has longer-term economic benefits, including future job creation in rebuilt fisheries and coastal tourism, and benefits to coastal economies including higher property values and better water quality. Therefore, investing in blue infrastructure habitat restoration is a green opportunity benefiting coastal economies and societies in both the short and the long term. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","{""Coyle, G.

6662042,"Effects Of Farm Management Practices And Environmental Factors On Bulk Tank Milk Antibodies Against Gastrointestinal Nematodes In Dairy Farms Across Canada","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been used as a diagnostic tool to quantify levels of gastrointestinal nematodes in dairy cattle by measuring Ostertagia ostertagi antibodies in milk. Higher levels of O. ostertagi antibodies measured by ELISA methods, referred to as optical density ratios (ODRs), are associated with decreased milk production in dairy cattle. On-farm management practices (e.g. pasturing techniques and anthelmintic usage) can influence the exposure of cattle to nematode infections and the magnitude of acquired worm burdens. Additionally, environmental and climatic factors, such as land elevation and precipitation, may also influence the levels of gastrointestinal parasitism. This repeated cross-sectional study investigated the effect of farm management practices and surrounding environmental factors on bulk tank (BT) ODRs in herds from provinces across Canada, and further examined the potential effects of various anthelmintic treatment protocols on BT ODRs. A total of 195 herds contributed an average of 3.5 BT samples between December 2003 and April 2005. The farm management practices were recorded from a questionnaire asking producers about their pasturing methods (confined, pastured, etc.), pasture sharing practices (e.g. mixing heifers with milking cows) and anthelmintic treatments. Environmental data were downloaded online from various governmental databases (e.g. Natural Resources Canada, Statistics Canada, Environment Canada, etc.). Statistical models, accounting for repeated measures (multiple BT ODRs for each farm) and for clustering of farms within a region (province or ecoregion), were used to analyze environmental and farm management data. Overall, the greater the exposure that heifers and milking cows had to pasture, the higher the levels of anti-parasite antibodies detected in BT samples. Treating the entire herd or treating milking cows at calving reduced BT ODR values. Farms in areas with higher number of rainy days, higher normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, and lower land surface temperatures (LSTs), were also likely to have higher BT ODRs. Seasonal variation was such that late summer and early fall, when parasite load was at its highest, yielded larger BT ODRs. Due to the high clustering effect at the herd level, factors at the herd level (e.g. pasturing methods, anthelmintic administration) had a higher potential impact on bulk-tank measurements than the herd's surrounding environmental factors.

6863269,"Contribution Of Remote Sensing To Wildfire Trend And Dynamic Analysis In Two Of Ghana’s Ecological Zones: Guinea-Savanna And Forest-Savanna Mosaic","Background: Two of Ghana’s ecological zones—Guinea-savanna zone (GSZ) and Forest-savanna mosaic zone (FSZ)—are practically homologous in terms of structure and floristic composition, with some differences. The various sub-ecosystems that make up these areas are being depleted and losing their natural values due to various threats. There is little understanding about the fire trends in these areas due to a lack of data and poor accessibility to existing fire statistics. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the trends of area burned and active fire in the Guinea-savanna and Forest-savanna mosaic zones in order to inform policy-makers about sustainable management options. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire (MDC14ML) and burned-area (MCD64A1) products to characterize the fire regime in terms of seasonality, intensity, density, burned area, frequency, and trends during the study period of 2001 to 2021. Results: This study indicated that fire activity started in October and peaked in December (GSZ) and January (FSZ). The mean proportion burned was approximately 39.95% (burned area of 2659.31 km2; FSZ) and 60.05% (burned area of 3996.63 km2: GSZ), while the frequency was approximately 42.87% (1759.95 of active fires; FSZ) and 57.13% (2345.26 of active fires: GSZ). In 2018, GSZ recorded the largest burned area (19 811.2 km2, which represents an average of 825.5 km2 of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 4719 active points detected. FSZ recorded its greatest burned area in 2015 (8727.4 km2; which represents an average of 363.6 km2 of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 5587 active points recorded. In addition, it was found that specific times of the day (1000 h to 1420 h) recorded the majority of burned areas. In overview, between 2001 and 2021, burned areas increased by an average of 1.4 km2 (FSZ) and 4.6 km2 (GSZ), and the number of active fires increased by an average of 4.7 (FSZ) and 4.4 (GSZ) active fires per km2. Conclusions: In conclusion, burned areas and active fires are increasing in both ecological zones. This study demonstrated the relevance of remote sensing to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence in Ghana and highlighted the need for fire control and fuel management by the policies and institutions (e.g., Ghana National Fire and Rescue Service) in these important and vulnerable zones (GSZ and FSZ). This is especially true in the Forest-savanna mosaic zone, which is increasingly affected by the disasters of wildfires and records more active fires than GSZ, indicating that this zone is becoming more and more vulnerable. Therefore, rigorous continuous monitoring is essential, and collaboration between organizations fighting for the conservation of natural resources in the field is strongly recommended. © 2023, The Author(s).","{""Dahan, K.

6691580,"Assessing the value of seasonal climate forecasts for decision-making","Seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) can support decision-making and thus help society cope with and prepare for climate variability and change. The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision-making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision-making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision-making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision-makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex-post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co-evaluation with decision-makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.","{""Bruno Soares, Marta""}","https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.523",2024-04-23 22:13:42,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2018,"{maybe}","{""assessing value of climate information|climate services|seasonal climate forecasts|value of climate ""}"

6863036,"Automatic Site Selection Of Sight-Seeing Route In Ecotourism Destinations Based On Landscape Perception Sensitivity","Sight-seeing route is an interactive interface between tourists and ecotourism environments. How to design tourist routes perperly and reduce the interference to the environment is an important issue to be resolved in ecological tourism plannings. Although public attitudes towards landscapes are shaped by many different factors, such as age, sex, social and economic status etc., there are also some common preferences to landscape types, especially for people with similar education background or environmental value orientations. Ecotourists are just such groups. This paper introduced the visible perception affected by landscape visibility, the best viewing distance and the best viewing orientation, and the ecological perception affected by the landscape types and the resource value into the landscape perception sensitivity model, and built a synthesis-weight computation model of ecotourism destination sight-seeing routes selection with the combination of topographic factors such as slope and relief degree of land surface (RDLS). The main steps are as follows. Firstly, the authors calculated the landscape perception degree of each landscape, then added the results together and divided the results into ten levels from high to low using the reclassification tools of ArcGIS, assigned 1-10 to each level; Secondly, calculated the slope and RDLS using terrain analysis tool of ArcGIS platform, and also divided the results into ten levels from low to high using the reclassification tools of ArcGIS, assigned 1-10 to each level; Thirdly, built the suitability computation function of sight-seeing route selection in ecotourism destinations, and calculated the weight results combined with landscape perception degree and terrain factors, then selected the best sight-seeing route using the optimal path analysis of ArcGIS platform; Finally, revised the sight-seeing route acquired automatically with field trips, expert opinion and other factors, so as to the characteristics of scenic landscape to be shown better, and the route is more realistic. This method is tested in the case of Qixiagu scenic region, Wu'an National Geopark in Handan, Hebei Province. Based on Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and high-resolution satellite images, the authors first built the virtual 3D landscape in the ecotourism destination, and then the best scenic sight-seeing route of Qixiagu scenic region was selected automatically based on the virtual geographical environment structured by ArcGIS platform. Finally the sight-seeing route was revised by field trips and other correction factors. Thus a sight-seeing route was determined in easy way where tourists can have better perception. This method can supply us a relatively reasonable sight-seeing route quickly in scenic spot planning period. The synthesis-weight computation model of ecotourism destination sight-seeing route selection provides a quantitative analysis method for the plannings of ecotourism and landscape designs in micro-scale. This method can be also applied to the evaluation the existing sight-seeing route in scenic spot. So it can provide more ideas and references for the management and ecology protection of scenic spots.","{""Li, J."",""Li, R.""}","10.5846/stxb201105310732",2024-09-30 17:28:34,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2012,"{""landscape perception"",""terra = terrain""}","{""Automatic site selection"",China,Hebei,""Landscape perception sensitivity"",""Sight-seeing route"",""Virtual geographical environment"",""Wu'an National Geopark"",""Wuan National Geopark"",automation,""digital elevation model"",ecotourism}"

6903535,"Seasonality Of Soil Erosion Under Mediterranean Conditions At The Alqueva Dam Watershed","The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9 t ha(-1)), contributing 65 \% of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1 t ha(-1)) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1 t ha(-1), and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314 x 10(3) kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices. This model will be integrated with World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies methods to support decision-making in that watershed, and it will involve collaboration with both local people and governmental institutions.",NA,"10.1007/s00267-014-0281-3",2024-09-30 17:15:11,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{""terra = mediterranean""}",NA
6862869,"Fuel Type Classification Using Airborne Laser Scanning And Sentinel 2 Data In Mediterranean Forest Affected By Wildfires","Mediterranean forests are recurrently affected by fire. The recurrence of fire in such environments and the number and severity of previous fire events are directly related to fire risk. Fuel type classification is crucial for estimating ignition and fire propagation for sustainable forest management of these wildfire prone environments. The aim of this study is to classify fuel types according to Prometheus classification using low-density Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data, Sentinel 2 data, and 136 field plots used as ground-truth. The study encompassed three different Mediterranean forests dominated by pines (Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster y P. nigra), oaks (Quercus ilex) and quercus (Q. faginea) in areas affected by wildfires in 1994 and their surroundings. Two metric selection approaches and two non-parametric classification methods with variants were compared to classify fuel types. The best-fitted classification model was obtained using Support Vector Machine method with radial kernel. The model includes three ALS and one Sentinel-2 metrics: the 25th percentile of returns height, the percentage of all returns above mean, rumple structural diversity index and NDVI. The overall accuracy of the model after validation was 59\%. The combination of data from active and passive remote sensing sensors as well as the use of adapted structural diversity indices derived from ALS data improved accuracy classification. This approach demonstrates its value for mapping fuel type spatial patterns at a regional scale under different heterogeneous and topographically complex Mediterranean forests.","{""Domingo, Dario"",""Echeverria, Maite"",""Garcia-Martin, Alberto"",""Hoffren, Raid"",""Ibarra, Paloma"",""Teresa Lamelas, Maria"",""de la Riva, Juan""}","10.3390/rs12213660",2024-07-18 22:33:03,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{calibration}","{""Prometheus fuel type; ALS; Sentinel 2; forest fires; Mediterranean forest""}"
6862777,"Based On The Gaussian Fitting Method To Derive Daily Evapotranspiration From Remotely Sensed Instantaneous Evapotranspiration","Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant component in the water cycle, and the estimation of it is imperative in water resource management. Regional ET can be derived by using remote sensing technology which combines remote sensing inputs with ground-based measurements. However, instantaneous ET values estimated through remote sensing directly need to be converted into daily totals. In this study, we attempted to retrieve daily ET from remotely sensed instantaneous ET. The study found that the Gaussian fitting curve closely followed the ET measurements during the daytime and hence put forward the Gaussian fitting method to convert the remotely sensed instantaneous ET into daily ETs. The method was applied to the middle reaches of Heihe River in China. Daily ETs on four days were derived and evaluated with ET measurements from the eddy covariance (EC) system. The correlation between daily ET estimates and measurements showed high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82, a mean average error (MAE) of 0.41mm, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.46mm. To make more scientific assessments, percent errors were calculated on the estimation accuracy, which ranged from 0\% to 18\%, with more than 80\% of locations having the percent errors within 10\%. Analyses on the relationship between daily ET estimates and land use status were also made to assess the Gaussian fitting method, and the results showed that the spatial distribution of daily ET estimates well demonstrated ET differences caused by land use types and was intimately linked with the vegetation pattern. The comparison between the Gaussian fitting method and the sine function method and the ETrF method indicated that results derived through the Gaussian fitting method had higher precision than that obtained by the sine function method and the ETrF method.","{""Chen, Shaohui"",""Liang, Hong"",""Liu, Suhua"",""Su, Hongbo"",""Tian, Jing"",""Wang, Weimin"",""Yang, Lijun"",""Zhang, Renhua""}","10.1155/2019/6253832",2024-09-27 22:55:05,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2019,"{}",NA
6903607,"Application Of Multiple-Optimization Filtering Algorithm In Remote Sensing Image Denoising","Denoising remote sensing images is crucial in the application and research of remote sensing imagery. Noise in remote sensing images originates from sensor characteristics, signal transmission, and environmental conditions, among which Gaussian noise is the most common type. In this paper, we proposed a multiple-optimization bilateral filtering (MOBF) algorithm based on edge detection and differential evolution (DE) methods. The proposed algorithm optimizes the spatial domain filtering kernel and the spatial domain Gaussian kernel by using the standard deviation and width of the edge response. By employing the DE algorithm, the individuals in the population based on the standard deviation of the gray value domain are subjected to iterative mutation, crossover, and selection operations to refine the latent solution vectors and determine the optimal color space for optimizing the standard deviation of the pixel range domain kernel. As a result, the MOBF algorithm, which does not require any parameter input, is realized. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, denoising experiments were conducted on remote sensing images by using evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index. The experimental results revealed that the MOBF algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms for all three evaluation metrics.",NA,"10.3390/s23187813",2024-09-26 00:42:10,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",NA,"{}",NA

Despite this, the lack of information at the subnational level hinders their proper management and conservation. This study aimed to identify the extension and distribution of forests and to develop an empirical model for the spatial prediction of soil organic matter (SOM) in Ixtacamaxtitlan, Puebla, Mexico, based on environmental variables generated through Geographical Information Systems. A supervised classification in Landsat 8 images was used to define the forest cover, and environmental variables related to topography, climate and vegetation were generated. Finally, a Multiple Linear Regression model validated with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to examine the relationships between the covariates and the SOM and estimate its content in forest. The results show that the forest cover extension is 41\%, with an overall accuracy of 97.7\%. The model shows a good fit (R-cv(2) = 0.69, RMSEcv = 1.53). The mean of SOM was 5.2\%, and upper values were consistent with higher altitude, precipitation and cooler temperature. Estimating SOM content in forest areas is essential in developing planning strategies at the subnational level to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.","{""Arroyo, Itzel"",""Castelan, Rosalia"",""Tamariz-Flores, Victor""}","10.3390/f14030539",2024-07-17 00:09:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""soil organic matter; temperate forest; environmental modeling; remote sensing""}"
6862821,"Remote Sensing Estimation Of Cotton Water Productivity In Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis Based On Google Earth Engine","An accurate and quantitative evaluation of crop water productivity is the basis for the improvement of crop yield in arid regions and is of great significance to alleviate water shortage and drive sustainable agricultural development. We have considered the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis on the north bank of the Tarim Basin of China as the subject area, and the watershed SEBAL remote sensing evapotranspiration model and cotton distribution identification model are established employing the Google Earth Engine cloud platform from 2009 to 2020. The production estimation model was used to evaluate the moisture productivity of cotton in the watershed. The following results were observed. (1) The cotton production in the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis ranges from 1610.10 kg·hm−2 in 2009 to 1855.05 kg·hm−2 in 2020, with a growth rate of 13.20%. The cotton planting area extends to the edge of oasis year by year, and the center of gravity of cotton production moves 2485 m from west to east. (2) The average evapotranspiration (ET) value during the cotton growth period was 686.80 mm in 2009 and was 738.66 mm in 2020, indicating an overall upward trend, with a growth rate of 7.02%. The maximum value of ET during the cotton growth period was observed during the flowering and boll-opening stages. The higher ET value is mainly distributed in the interior of the oasis and at the edge of the north bank of the Tarim River. (3) The average water productivity in 2009 and 2020 was 0.21 kg·m−3 and 0.25 kg·m−3, respectively, indicating a growth rate of 16% in 12 years. In terms of space, the gravity center of water productivity in the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis moved 1832 m from the northeast to the southwest of Hongqi Town, with an average annual moving speed of 152.67 m·a−1. The water productivity of oasis cotton showed an expanding trend in the east-west direction compared with that in the north-south direction. The trend of spatial distribution direction had been enhanced, and the spatial pattern tended to be agglomerated. (4) After 12 years, the increased yield rate exceeded the increased evapotranspiration rate, promoting the increase of water productivity. Moreover, water productivity is closely related to the cotton planting area and reasonable water irrigation technology. High water productivity is mainly distributed in Xinken Farm in Xayar County and Sangtamu Farm in Xinhe County, respectively. The large-scale planting and intensive management of farms promoted and improved cotton production, stable distribution, and efficient use of agricultural water resources. © 2023 Science China Press.

This urban expansion resulted from economic growth driven by population increase and tourism-related development. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCCs) and LST. Utilising Landsat 5-TM and Landsat-8 data from 1990, 2000, and 2020, we employed a random forest algorithm for supervised classification, generating Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. The mono-window algorithm was used to extract LST data from Landsat 5 and 8 images, alongside Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps. s regression analysis assessed the LST-NDVI correlation. Results indicate that urban LULCCs significantly contribute to rising LST. Minimum and maximum LST values for 1990, 2000, and 2020 were 18.6°C, 22.8°C, 22.6°C, and 26.7°C, 34.5°C, and 42.1°C, respectively. NDVI values ranged from −0.2 to 0.56 in 1990, −0.17 to 0.58 in 2000, and 0.07 to 0.46 in 2020. Roads, pavements, barren land, and built-up areas displayed the highest LST (44.6°C), while water bodies and healthy vegetation exhibited the lowest (16.1°C). Additionally, NDVI exhibited a negative correlation with LST. Our findings emphasise the role of human activities in exacerbating LST. They highlight the need for regulated urban growth patterns to ensure sustainable development. Moreover, quantifying spatiotemporal variations in LULC, LST, and NDVI holds importance for conserving land resources and enhancing land use planning policies.

6691610,"Linking Earth Observation and mobile Technologies for improved Decision-Support in Case of Droughts and related Food Insecurity","Droughts are complex events that constitute a natural part of the climate. Among all natural disasters they show the largest spatio-temporal extent, cause enormous economic loss and numerous casualties. Although droughts pose a threat to both industrialized and developing countries the latter often suffer from chronic poverty and vulnerability, which pave the way for wide-ranging impacts. Earth observation can support aid organizations that are often struggling to cope with the impact of large-scale drought events. However, exploiting the added-value of new technologies requires tools that are adapted to individual user requirements and in-depth knowledge transfer. Within the framework of a project named SATIDA (Satellite Technologies for Improved Drought Risk Assessment) this dissertation links satellite-derived information that aims at the detection of environmental anomalies to information about socio-economic conditions, collected via a corresponding open-source mobile application. The satellite component is based on the combination of different satellite observations (rainfall, soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation health) in an Enhanced Combined Drought Index (ECDI). The soil moisture component, which is considered a key variable between atmospheric and land surface conditions, is improved by linking near-real-time (NRT) observations from active and passive microwave sensors to an offline dataset that was generated within the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). This way, it is possible to detect soil moisture anomalies based on more than 37 years of data (19782015). Supported by Doctors without Borders, the tests were conducted in the Central African Republic and in Ethiopia. The dissertation results in three key findings. First, current NRT observations of soil moisture are mature enough to be considered for operational drought monitoring. Second, the method to combine different variables in the ECDI facilitates exploiting the individual strengths of all input datasets, and the robust detection of major drought events. Third, the combination of earth observation and mobile technologies is beneficial for humanitarian aid organizations that aim at pro-active disaster risk reduction.","{""Enenkel, Markus""}","https://repositum.tuwien.at/retrieve/5603",2024-04-25 02:19:41,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}",NA

6903618,"Sustainable Aquifer Management For Food Security","In aquifer-dependent regions, balancing aquifer protection, desalination, economic development, agricultural irrigation, and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping. Aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers. Despite its importance, little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown. The novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer. It develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination, the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users, aquifers, and time periods. A mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter Lotikipi Aquifer, discovered in 2013 in northern Kenya using modern remote sensing methods. While initial pumping of the Lotikipi Aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels, interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation. The model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels. Based on that exercise, a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven-year time period. A third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system. Results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of \$0.08 - \$0.18 USD per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available. While this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places, the future could be more optimistic. Advances in desalination technology, higher crop prices, technical advance in agriculture, and development of drought-resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination.",NA,"10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108073",2024-10-03 21:58:35,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6903486,"Monitoring Soil Elements For Irrigation Management Using Internet Of Things (Iot) Sensors","Smart farming focuses on three crucial areas: soil quality, weather conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant impact of weather and irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly integrated with smart environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients) systems for a holistic approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing soil monitoring, giving farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize disease risks, and rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible to measure various parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels, and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors is then transmitted to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth analysis, visual representation, and trend identification. The application of the IoT in agriculture is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential pillar of precision agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management of resources. Smart sensor systems provide more information about water and crop water requirements. This information can be used to mechanically manage the water supply system and help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information acquired by the first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article proposes and evaluates the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were selected to test the IoT system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically designed for soil and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil pH, moisture, and NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation water pH and turbidity sensors exhibited notably precise measurements.

6863058,"Remote Sensing Monitoring Of Changes In Winter Wheat Area In North China Plain From 2001 To 2011","The North China Plain is the major producing area for winter wheat in China. It is also amongst the global hotspots in terms of severe water scarcity. The monitoring and mapping of winter wheat in an efficient and accurate manner is of great significance for effective policy management on both agriculture and water resources in the North China Plain. Remote sensing technology has been proved to be a practical and feasible method for agricultural crop area extraction in previous researches. In this study, a multi-source remote sensing monitoring system was built, in order to quickly and accurately extract the spatial and temporal information of winter wheat in the North China Plain. Specifically, a spectral curve library for winter wheat was constructed, using MODIS EVI time-series data and two TM images in 2011; and the uniform rules were formulated for the identification of winter wheat, with the combination of phenology calendar in each province in the North China Plain. The spatial and temporal changes of areas planting with winter wheat in 2001-2011 in the North China Plain were extracted using the above uniform rules, and its patterns were analyzed at the grid level, the county level and the province level, respectively. The results showed that: 1) The classification accuracy of winter wheat extracted by the multi-source remote sensing monitoring system was good at the grid scale, and the overall accuracies were stable in 2001-2011, with the values ranging between 74.80% in 2001 and 78.14% in 2011; at the county level, area planting with winter wheat extracted by the multi-source remote sensing monitoring system in 2011 agreed well with the statistics, with the determination coefficient R2 of 0.89 and the root mean square error RMSE of 1.29×104 hm2; the error between the above two data sets was 11.31% in 2011. 2) Area planting with winter wheat in the North China Plain continued to increase in 2001-2011, and it was 156.05×104 hm2 (14.96%) more in 2011 than that in 2001; in 2001-2006, areas planting with winter wheat all increased in four provinces including Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, and it continued to increase in Shandong and Henan in 2006-2011, while weak reductions occurred in Jiangsu and Anhui at the same time; in comparison, areas planting with winter wheat all represented significant decline in volatility in 2001-2011 in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. 3) There was an obvious ""increase in the south and decrease in the north"" pattern for spatial and temporal changes of areas planting with winter wheat in 2001-2011 across the North China Plain; the spatial expansions of winter wheat were mainly spotted in the middle and southern part of the North China Plain, including the Southwest Shandong Plain, the Jiaolai Plain, the East Henan Plain and the North Anhui Plain, while shrinkages of winter wheat were mainly found in the northern part of the North China Plain, including the plain areas of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. The spatial pattern of changes in areas planting with winter wheat could be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of water resources, and it was also likely to be associated with the increasing opportunity cost of agricultural labor forces, the benefit changes of winter wheat and the agricultural subsidy policy. However, the major driving forces and their driving mechanisms deserved deep analysis. This study can provide useful information for decision makings on crop planting structure adjustment, food security guarantee and water management optimization, and can also be used as a reference for large-scale and long-time monitoring of spatial and temporal information of crop planting areas with remote sensing data as the main data source. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

6863376,"Landscape And Local Site Variables Differentially Influence Pollinators And Pollination Services In Urban Agricultural Sites","Urbanization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as agricultural and semi-natural habitats are converted into landscapes dominated by built features. Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban landscapes.","{""Bennett, Ashley B."",""Lovell, Sarah""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0212034",2024-07-17 21:37:15,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2019,"{""sentinel plants""}",NA
6863527,"Accounting And The Enactment Of Power: Municipal Reform By Peter Leopold 1774-1775","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the enduring, fundamental contributions of accounting practices in the pursuit of decentralization by governments, with an examination of Peter Leopold's reform of the municipalities in the late eighteenth century in Italy. Design/methodology/approach An extensive textual analysis of the very comprehensive collection of primary sources of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany during the de' Medici and Hapsburg-Lorraine's rule identified the reasons for Peter Leopold's decision to decentralize his government's authority and responsibilities. A systemic comparison of the 1765-1766 and 1775-1776 financial reports of the Municipality of Castrocaro and Terra del Sole disclosed the importance of the micro-practices of accounting and reporting for the reform. Findings In the context of the eighteenth century enlightenment, Peter Leopold legitimized his reform by the introduction of a modern style of government based on the rationalization of the municipal administrative system and decentralization of central authority and responsibility. The reform was made feasible by the substitution of a birth right principle with an economic discourse which linked tax payments to property ownership. This had the unintended consequence of increased taxes, higher municipal expenditures and possible inequalities between municipalities. Originality/value Few accounting studies have considered the micro-aspects of decentralization reforms at the municipal level and tried to identify their impact on the wealth of the population. Moreover, Peter Leopold's reform is considered one of the most innovative and enlightened of the eighteenth century, while the remainder of Europe was still overwhelmingly committed to the centralization of administrative apparatuses. Finally, this study relates to the multi-disciplinary debate about the recognition, qualification and accountization of the impact of decentralization of responsibility for the delivery of government services.","{""Castellini, Monia"",""Funnell, Warwick"",""Maran, Laura""}","10.1108/aaaj-10-2017-3180",2024-10-03 21:52:34,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2019,"{}","{""Municipality; Administrative reform; Accounting system; Decentralization of government; Eighteenth c""}"
6862885,"Surface Behavior Of Pelagic Juvenile Loggerhead Sea Turtles In The Eastern North Atlantic","Sea turtles bask at the ocean surface, but little is known about the patterns and ecological context of surface behavior in the wild. This study investigated the surface behavior of ten juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (34 - 58 cm straight carapace length) satellite tagged in Madeira, in the pelagic eastern North Atlantic. During a total of 2273 tracking days, turtles moved through oceanic areas with a mean depth of similar to 3400 m. On average, turtles spent one third of the time at the surface (0 - 1 m depth), spending 43\% of the time at the surface during the day and 29\% of the time during the night. Generalized linear mixed modelling showed that the proportion of time at the surface was significantly larger during the day, particularly during spring and summer. Time spent at the surface during the day increased with elevated air temperatures and weak winds, probably to maximize the benefits of solar absorption. Conversely, the probability of being at the surface during the day decreased as horizontal search effort increased, suggesting a trade-off between basking and daytime foraging activities. At night, time spent at the surface was not associated with air temperature or wind speed but was instead positively associated with moon illumination. As turtles tend to dive deeper during clear nights, increased surface time may be needed to recover from deeper dives. This study presents important aspects of the behavioral ecology of the species during the oceanic juvenile phase. The findings reported here may be relevant for species management and conservation, including correction of census data and management of interactions with surface fishing gear and other anthropogenic activities.","{""Caldeira, Rui"",""Dellinger, Thomas"",""Freitas, Carla""}","10.1016/j.jembe.2018.10.006",2024-09-27 23:04:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Argos; Biologging; Basking; Caretta caretta; First passage time; Satellite telemetry""}"

The vegetation in urban areas has received more attention due to benefits it provides, whether ecological, aesthetic and social; which can be considered as Urban Forest (FU). The aim of this study was to identify the FU (public and private) of Curitiba, PR through remote sensing high spatial resolution techniques, to produce spatial information as a basis for land use and occupation planning. Enhancement techniques were applied in GeoEye-1 images for classification by the decision tree method. The results showed that the FU corresponds to 43.69% of Curitiba area, being 8.99% of these public areas and 34.70% private areas. Although almost half of city's area is covered by the FU, the amount that is available for direct use by the population in green areas form is insufficient, since less than 10% is effectively public and only 3% is embedded in the green areas.

6863666,"Development Of Methodology To Prioritise Wildlife Pathogens For Surveillance","We developed and evaluated a methodology to prioritise pathogens for a wildlife disease surveillance strategy in New Zealand. The methodology, termed 'rapid risk analysis' was based on the import risk analysis framework recommended by the Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE), and involved: hazard identification, risk estimation, and ranking of 48 exotic and 34 endemic wildlife pathogens. The risk assessment was more rapid than a full quantitative assessment through the use of a semi-quantitative approach to score pathogens for probability of entry to NZ (release assessment), likelihood of spread (exposure assessment) and consequences in free-living wildlife, captive wildlife, humans, livestock and companion animals. Risk was estimated by multiplying the scores for the probability of entry to New Zealand by the likelihood of spread by the consequences for free-living wildlife, humans and livestock. The rapid risk analysis methodology produced scores that were sufficiently differentiated between pathogens to be useful for ranking them on the basis of risk. Ranking pathogens on the basis of the risk estimate for each population sector provided an opportunity to identify the priorities within each sector alone thus avoiding value-laden comparisons between sectors. Ranking pathogens across all three population sectors by summing the risk estimate for each sector provided a comparison of total risk which may be useful for resource allocation decisions at national level. Ranking pathogens within each wildlife taxonomic group using the total risk estimate was most useful for developing specific surveillance strategies for each group. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Land-use change in the coastal zone has a substantial effect on habitat connectivity and biodiversity. However, few studies have characterized the effects of land-use change on coastal habitat connectivity. We conducted remote sensing analysis, modeling with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model, geospatial analysis, and habitat connectivity analysis to evaluate historical spatiotemporal changes in the habitat quality and habitat connectivity of migratory shorebirds in the Yellow River Delta, which is an important stopover site along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway migratory route. Several high- and medium-quality areas have been converted to industrial mining and mariculture sites because of land reclamation. The probability of connectivity decreased by -66.7\% between 1975 and 2020. Approximately 71.0\%, 11.6\%, and 5.8\% of patches with high importance have been converted to non-habitat patches, habitat patches with medium importance, and habitat patches with low importance, respectively; approximately 58.9\% and 11.7\% of the patches with medium importance have been converted to non-habitat patches and habitat patches with low importance, respectively. The total priority conservation area was 389.4 km(2), and 125.0 km(2) (32.1\%) of this area remains unprotected; these unprotected areas are mainly distributed in the northwestern and eastern parts of the Yellow River Delta.

Emphasis is placed on measures of the quality of such information and on the relationship between quality and economic value. The fallowing/planting problem for a spring wheat farmer is examined in detail as a specific application. It is assumed that the farmer's goal is to maximize the total expected discounted return over an infinite horizon, which places this problem within the general framework of Markov decision processes. By means of stochastic dynamic programming, the economic value to the farmer of currently available seasonal precipitation forecasts, as well as of hypothetical improvements in the quality of such forecasts, is estimated. Because the relationship between the quality and value of forecasts is highly nonlinear, the need to explicitly determine value-of-information estimates, rather than relying on quality as a surrogate for value, is made clear.","{""Katz, Richard""}","https://doi.org/10.1002/for.3980060202",2024-04-23 22:37:30,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",1987,"{}","{""Dynamic programming|Markov decision process|Value of information|Weather Forecasts""}"
6903602,"Quantifying Variance Across Spatial Scales As Part Of Fire Regime Classifications","The emergence of large-scale fire classifications and products informed by remote sensing data has enabled opportunities to include variability or heterogeneity as part of modem fire regime classifications. Currently, basic fire metrics such as mean fire return intervals are calculated without considering spatial variance in a management context. Fire return intervals are also only applicable at a particular grain size (defined as the spatial unit of interest) even though they are typically applied homogeneously. In this study, we utilized a 29-yr fire occurrence database to show how spatial variance changes with respect to grain as postulated by Wiens (1989) when reporting fire patterns within the Great Plains, USA. We utilized data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database of fire occurrence for the years 1984-2012. We analyzed median numbers of fire along with their variance at four spatial grains ranging from small units (e.g., plots at 3 x 3 km resolution) to large units (e.g., landscapes at 1500 x 2700 km resolution). Median number of fire occurrences was consistently low, irrespective of grain. Despite the consistency in low median numbers of fires across grain, variance in the numbers of fires between units decreased. Variance within units, however, did not change as grain increased indicating fire-pattern-scale inconsistencies. Fire pattern interpretations depended entirely on the scale at which it is calculated. Given that the Great Plains region has a large disparity in fire patterns (i.e., some regions burn often, while others may never burn), fire regime classifications will benefit from including scale-specific variance estimates as a foundation for understanding changes in fire regimes and corresponding social-ecological and policy responses.",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2343",2024-09-30 16:57:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6691510,"Near Real-time Wildfire Management Using Distributed Satellite System","Climate action (SDG-13) is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN), and wildfire is one of the catastrophic events related to climate change. Large-scale forest fires have drastically increased in frequency and size in recent years in Australia and other nations. These wildfires endanger the forests and urban areas of the world, demolish vast amounts of property, and frequently result in fatalities. There is a requirement for real-time/near real-time catastrophic event monitoring of fires due to their growing frequency. In order to effectively monitor disaster events, it will be feasible to manage them in real-time or near real-time, thanks to the advent of the Distributed Satellite System (DSS). This research examines the possible applicability of DSS for wildfire surveillance. For spacecraft to continually monitor the dynamically changing environment, satellite missions must have broad coverage and revisit intervals that DSS can fulfil. A feasibility analysis, as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, are included in this paper to enable prompt action and swiftly provide alerts. In our previous research, it is shown that on-board implementation, i.e., data processing utilising hardware accelerators, is feasible. To enable Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operation (TASO), the same will be included in the proposed DSS architecture, and the outcomes will be provided. To demonstrate the applicability, the suggested DSS architecture will be tested in several geographic locations to demonstrate the system-wide coverage.","{""Thangavel, Kathiravan""}","https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2022.3229173",2024-04-23 22:12:41,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""1-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)|Distributed Satellite System (DSS)|Climate Action|Edge Comput""}"
6863053,"Soil Erosion Risk Assessment Of Hilly Terrain Through Integrated Approach Of Rusle And Geospatial Technology: A Case Study Of Tirap District, Arunachal Pradesh","Present study was carried out in Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh characterized by mountainous terrain coupled with torrential rainfall. Forests and agriculture land cover are exposed to varied level of anthropogenic and deforestation activities. All these have augmented into pronounced soil erosion thereby negatively impacting the socio- economy of the rural population. Topographic, management, soil and landuse factors were among the most important drivers influencing the soil erosion. Keeping above in account, present study emphasizes the applicability of geospatial technology coupled with field data to estimate soil erosion rate which could be helpful in developing suitable management plan. Numerous empirical models are available for estimating soil erosion; however, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system framework was applied in the current study due to its robustness and simplicity. RUSLE factors such as erosivity of rainfall (RE), erodibility of soil (ES), slope length (LS), crop management (CM) and conservation practice (CP) were calculated using available data. Rainfall erosivity factor was 323.8 MJ mm/ha/h/year. ES factor ranged from 0.16 to 0.28 Mg h/MJ/mm and LS factor ranges between 0 and 44.62. NDVI derived crop management factor ranges between 0 and 1.7. Conservation practice factor values ranged from 0.004 to 1. The annual soil loss was modeled using different factors of RULSE model and soil loss was predicted (1.38-59.05 ton per hectare). Keeping threshold value of soil erosion (<10 ton per hectare) in account, most part of the study area is suitable for agriculture practices however, emphasis on suitable soil and water conservation measures are perquisite for sustainable environment management.","{""Bordoloi, Reetashree"",""Das, Biswajit"",""Pandey, Pankaj K."",""Paul, Ashish"",""Tripathi, Om Prakash""}","10.1007/s40808-018-0435-z",2024-07-17 00:02:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{GIS,""Soil erosion; Land use/cover; RUSLE model; Digital elevation model (DEM); Remote sensing""}"
6863045,"Performance Of Fire Danger Indices And Their Utility In Predicting Future Wildfire Danger Over The Conterminous United States","Predicting current and future wildfire frequency and size is central to wildfire control and management. Multiple fire danger indices (FDIs) that incorporate weather and fuel conditions have been developed and utilized to support wildfire predictions and risk assessment. However, the scale-dependent performance of individual FDIs remains poorly understood, which leads to large uncertainty in the estimated fire sizes under climate change. Here, we calculate four commonly used FDIs over the conterminous United States using high-resolution (4 km) climate and fuel data sets for the 1984-2019 period. The relationships of these four FDIs to the observed wildfire sizes show that higher values of FDIs correlate to larger total fire sizes; this correlation is more robust at larger spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the daily minimum relative humidity and precipitation are the most important drivers of the annual mean fire danger. In the instances of extreme fire danger, wind speed becomes a critical factor and should be considered in the calculation of the FDI. To assess the impact of climate change on future fire size, we calculate the present-day and end-of-century FDIs using the 12 km regional climate model simulations. The four FDIs generally predict consistent changes in future fire potential, suggesting an overall higher fire potential in conjunction with a prolonged wildfire season in future climate. Regionally, the four FDIs also reveal similar seasonal patterns as the enhancement arises mostly in spring and summer over the southwest US while in summer and fall over the northern and eastern US.","{""Feng, Yan"",""Wang, Jiali"",""Wright, Daniel B."",""Yu, Guo""}","10.1029/2023ef003823",2024-07-18 23:52:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""potential; fire danger indices; historical trend; future projections"",""wildfires; fire danger""}"
6903594,"Balancing Model Generality And Specificity In Management-Focused Habitat Selection Models For Gunnison Sage-Grouse","Identifying, protecting, and restoring habitats for declining wildlife populations is foundational to conservation and recovery planning for any species at risk of decline. Resource selection analysis is a key tool to assess habitat and prescribe management actions. Yet, it can be challenging to map suitable resource conditions across a wide range of ecological contexts and use the resulting models to identify effective and universal habitat improvement actions. We developed a management-centric modeling approach that sought to balance the need to evaluate the consistency of key habitat conditions and improvement actions across multiple, distinct populations, while allowing context-specific environmental variables and spatial scales to nuance selection responses that form the basis of location-specific management prescriptions. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a set of habitat selection models for Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation, species recovery, and habitat management efforts are needed in six isolated satellite populations (San Miguel, Crawford, Pinon Mesa, Dove Creek, Cerro Summit-Cimarron-Sims, and Poncha Pass) where environmental conditions differ, and the already small number of birds are declining. We used multi-scale and seasonal resource selection analyses to quantify relationships between environmental conditions and sites used by animals. All models included key habitat variables often altered through management actions to assess their differential influences across models. We found important similarities and differences among satellites, indicating that, although some rules of thumb are generally well-grounded, the consideration of population-specific environmental differences could increase the efficiency of local habitat improvement actions. Sagegrouse also had diverse responses to resource conditions at different scales, indicating that regional spatial (e.g., landscape) and local patch scale can differentially influence expected habitat improvements associated with where such management actions are implemented. Although context variables such as topography cannot be manipulated, sage-grouse associations revealed information that could guide the siting of improvement actions. This approach to balancing management objectives associated with habitat assessment may benefit spatially-structured populations with different environmental contexts and species with complex habitat needs and associations.",NA,"10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01935",2024-09-26 00:37:48,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""satellite populations""}",NA
6863315,"From Ers 1/2 To Sentinel-1: Subsidence Monitoring In Italy In The Last Two Decades","The use of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) products has greatly increased in the last years because of the technological advances in terms of both acquisition sensors and processing algorithms. The development of multi-interferogram techniques and the availability of free SAR analysis tools has significantly increased the number of worldwide applications of satellite measurements for mapping and monitoring geohazards. InSAR techniques excel in determining ground deformation in urban areas, where the coherence of the radar images is high, and the obtainable results are particularly reliable. Thus, measuring urban subsidence has always been one of the main targets of the InSAR analysis. In this paper, we present a brief review on the applications, in the last decades, of both single and multi-interferogram techniques to monitor ground lowering in urban areas along the Italian Peninsula. Because of its geological context, Italy is prone to slow natural subsidence phenomena sometimes aggravated and accelerated, especially along the coasts and in urbanized areas, by anthropogenic factors (i.e., groundwater overexploitation, consolidation in recent urban expansion, geothermal activities). The review will show how the interferometric data allowed the scientific community to increase the knowledge of the phenomena, map their spatial distribution, and reconstruct their temporal evolution. The final goal of the review is to demonstrate the added value of InSAR data in supporting groundwater management and urban development in Italy.","{""Bianchini, Silvia"",""Ciampalini, Andrea"",""Del Soldato, Matteo"",""Ezquerro, Pablo"",""Montalti, Roberto"",""Moretti, Sandro"",""Raspini, Federico"",""Solari, Lorenzo""}","10.3389/feart.2018.00149",2024-09-30 17:02:36,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",2018,"{""added value""}","{""regional scale applications; satellite monitoring"",""subsidence; DInSAR; MTInSAR; urban monitoring; local""}"

In this paper we present a quantitative, geospatial wildfire risk assessment tool, developed in response to demands for improved risk-based decision frameworks. The methodology leverages off recent and significant advancements in wildfire simulation models and geospatial data acquisition and management. The tool is intended to facilitate monitoring trends in wildfire risk over time and to develop information useful in prioritizing fuels treatments and mitigation measures. Wildfire risk assessment requires analyzing the likelihood of wildfire by intensity level, and the magnitude of potential beneficial and negative effects to valued resources from fire at different intensity levels. This effort is designed to support strategic planning by systematically portraying how fire likelihood and intensity influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values at the national scale. We present results for the continental United States, analyze high risk areas by geographic region, and examine how risk evaluations changes under different assumptions with sensitivity analysis.

6863358,"Time Ring Data: Definition And Application In Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Urban Expansion And Forest Loss","Remote sensing can provide spatio-temporal continuous Earth observation data and is becoming the main data source for spatial and temporal analysis. Remote sensing data have been widely used in applications such as meteorological monitoring, forest investigation, environmental health, urban planning, and water conservancy. While long-time-series remote sensing data are used for spatio-temporal analysis, this analysis is usually limited because of the large data volumes and complex models used. This study intends to develop an innovative and simple approach to reveal the spatio-temporal characteristics of geographic features from the perspective of remote sensing data themselves. We defined an efficient remote sensing data structure, namely time ring (TR) data, to depict the spatio-temporal dynamics of two common geographic features. One is spatially expansive features. Taking nighttime light (NTL) as an example, we generated a NTL TR map to exhibit urban expansion with spatial and temporal information. The speed and acceleration maps of NTL TR data indicated extraordinary expansion in the last 10 years, especially in coastal cities and provincial capitals. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province, Shandong Province, and Jiangsu Province exhibited fast acceleration of urbanization. The other is spatially contractive features. We took forest loss in the Amazon basin as an example and produced a forest cover TR map. The speed and acceleration were mapped in two 10-year periods (2000-2010 and 2010-2020) in order to observe the changes in Amazon forest cover. Then, combining cropland TR data, we determined the consistency of the spatio-temporal variations and used a linear regression model to detect the association between the acceleration of cropland and forest. The forest TR map showed that, spatially, there was an apparent phenomenon of forest loss occurring in the southern and eastern Amazon basin. Temporally, the speed of forest loss was more drastic between 2000 and 2010 than that in 2010-2020. In addition, the acceleration of forest loss showed a dispersed distribution, except for in Bolivia, which demonstrated a concentrated regional acceleration. The R-squared value of the linear regression between forest and cropland acceleration reached 0.75, indicating that forest loss was closely linked to the expansion of cropland. The TR data defined in this study not only optimized the use of remote sensing data, but also facilitated their application in spatio-temporal integrative analysis. More importantly, multi-field TR data could be jointly applied to explore the driving force at spatial and temporal scales.","{""Bao, Haijun"",""Li, Xinhu"",""Liu, Xin""}","10.3390/rs15040972",2024-07-16 23:30:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{""algorithm is valued""}","{""time ring data; long time series; spatio-temporal characteristics; Amazon forest cover; urban expans""}"
6863488,"Mapping And Detection Of Land Use Change In A Coal Mining Area Using Object-Based Image Analysis","Object-based image analysis was used to map land use in the Panxie coal mining area, East China, where long-term underground coal mines have been exploited since the 1980s. A rule-based classification approach was developed for a Pleiades image to identify the desired land use classes, and the same rule-based classification strategies, after the threshold values had been modified slightly, were applied to the Landsat series images. Five land use classes were successfully captured with overall accuracies of between 80 and 94\%. The classification approach was validated for its flexibility and robustness. Multitemporal classification results indicated that land use changed considerably in the Panxie coal mining area from 1989 to 2013. The urban, coal and coal gangue, and water areas increased rapidly in line with the growth in mine production. Urban areas increased from 9.38 to 20.92\% and showed a tendency to increase around the coal mines. From 1989 to 2013 the coal and coal gangue area increased by 40-fold, from 0.02 to 0.58\%. Similarly, the water area increased from 2.77 to 7.84\% over this time period, mainly attributable to the spread of waterlogged areas. The waterlogged areas increased to about 2900 ha in 2013, which was about 80 times more than their area in 1989. In contrast, the area of cultivated land was negatively related to the increase in mine production and decreased from 73.11 to 57.25\%.

6903499,"Classification Of County Leading Function Types And Pattern Recognition Of Its Spatial Structure Based On Multi-Source Data","It is of great significance to study the types of dominant function at county level and analyze the spatial structure pattern for the guidance and planning regulation of regional comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, this paper uses K-means clustering analysis to classify 124 dominant functional areas of county units. Based on the Tencent location big data, the spatial structure index was constructed using the rank-size rule. The spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were identified and analyzed by combining remote sensing data. Research results show that, firstly, the use of statistics, remote sensing, social media, night lighting multi-source data, and K means clustering method in county dominant function classification can get nice results, which can objectively reflect the features of area. The dominant function of counties in Guangdong can be divided into five classes, including ecological leading, agricultural leading, industry leadership, center service, and balanced developmental. Secondly, the rank-size law method based on Tencent location big data can break through the city scale. It can be used together with the quantitative analysis of remote sensing data in the study of spatial structure pattern recognition at the meso-county scale. Thirdly, the average value of spatial structure index of agriculture-oriented and ecology-oriented counties is greater than 1, showing a trend of single center spatial structure. The mean value of spatial structure index of industrial dominated county is less than 1, showing a polycentric spatial structure trend. The mean value of spatial structure index of balanced development county is close to 1. There are differences in spatial structure characteristics of balanced development county in different regions. Fourthly, the spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were significantly different. The ecology-dominated counties showed a single central pole core pattern, while the agriculture-dominated counties showed a single central pole core and scattered point pattern. The balanced development counties had obvious coexistence characteristics of multiple patterns, while the industrial-dominated counties showed a multi-center network distribution pattern. © 2021, Science Press.

6691581,"Supporting better decisions across the nexus of water, energy and food through earth observation data: case of the Zambezi basin","The water–energy–food (WEF) nexus has been promoted in recent years as an intersectional concept designed to improve planning and regulatory decision-making across the three sectors. The production and consumption of water, energy and food resources are inextricably linked across multiple spatial scales (from the global to the local), but a common feature is competition for land which through different land management practices mediates provisioning ecosystem services. The nexus perspective seeks to understand the interlinkages and use systems-based thinking to frame management options for the present and the future. It aims to highlight advantage and minimise damaging and unsustainable outcomes through informed decisions regarding trade-offs inclusive of economic, ecological and equity considerations. Operationalizing the WEF approach is difficult because of the lack of complete data, knowledge and observability – and the nature of the challenge also depends on the scale of the investigation. Transboundary river basins are particularly challenging because whilst the basin unit defines the hydrological system this is not necessarily coincident with flows of food and energy. There are multiple national jurisdictions and geopolitical relations to consider. Land use changes have a profound influence on hydrological, agricultural, energy provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Future policy decisions in the water, energy and food sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land and water resources, intensifying competition for these resources in the future. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse the land cover changes in the Zambezi river basin (1.4 million km2) from 1992 to 2015 using the European Space Agency annual global land cover dataset. Early results indicate transformative processes are underway with significant shifts from tree cover to cropland, with a 4.6 % loss in tree cover and a 16 % gain in cropland during the study period. The changes were found to be occurring mainly in the eastern (Malawi and Mozambique) and southern (Zimbabwe and southern Zambia) parts of the basin. The area under urban land uses was found to have more than doubled during the study period gearing urban centres increasingly as the foci for resource consumption. These preliminary findings are the first step in understanding the spatial and temporal interlinkages of water, energy and food by providing reliable and consistent evidence spanning the local, regional, national and whole transboundary basin scale.","{""Gomo, Fortune""}","https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-376-15-2018",2024-04-28 00:52:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}",NA
6862746,"Current Barriers And Factors Of Success In The Diffusion Of Satellite Services In Europe","Satellite services benefit civil society by helping tackle challenges such as climate change, the digital divide, etc. They have the potential to deliver concrete benefits to European society through innovative services supporting economic, societal and environmental policies. Such benefits can trigger increased public support for space in Europe. However, this potential has yet to be achieved. This paper argues that technological bias, the diversity of interests and initiatives among stakeholders and their individual actions do not always serve their collective objective to ensure wide diffusion of satellite services. It draws on theories of diffusion of innovation and on its authors' participatory work with the space and the user communities and at their interface in an effort to help diffuse satellite services within civil society. One of the major causes of insufficient service diffusion is the weakness of the interface between the space and user communities; some of factors that currently contribute to this state of affairs are the space community's over-reliance on publicly financed, technical demonstration projects as solutions to service diffusion; insufficient coordination by public authorities of innovation policies and programmes with other public policies and objectives; and an insufficient integration of satellite services within users' culture, traditional tools and services. The discussion allows for conclusions to be drawn on how the system of stakeholders could function better in order for satellite services to be successfully diffused in Europe.

6863570,"The Smart Grid - State-Of-The-Art And Future Trends","This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition with that suggested by a study group of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,) Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are given next. The first considers distribution network active management and future development trends in technologies and methods, where centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid. Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new and innovative research approaches and results are included. These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI) in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for wind-thermal-pumped storage systems, optimized power system restoration, robust data transmission upon compressive sensing, data fusion for wide-area oscillation monitoring, satellite based GPS synchronized monitoring systems, stability in Smart Grid with emerging renewable energy techno- logies. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","{""El-Hawary, M.

6863181,"Characterization Of Near-Infrared Imaging And Indocyanine-Green Use Amongst General Surgeons: A Survey Of 263 General Surgeons","Background: Near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) is an increasingly utilized imaging modality, however its use amongst general surgeons and its barriers to adoption have not yet been characterized. Methods: This survey was sent to Canadian Association of General Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons members. Survey development occurred through consensus of NIRFI experienced surgeons. Results: Survey completion rate for those opening the email was 16.0% (n = 263). Most respondents had used NIRFI (n = 161, 61.2%). Training, higher volumes, and bariatric, thoracic, or foregut subspecialty were associated with use (P <.001). Common reasons for NIRFI included anastomotic assessment (n = 117, 72.7%), cholangiography (n = 106, 65.8%), macroscopic angiography (n = 66, 41.0%), and bowel viability assessment (n = 101, 62.7%). Technical knowledge, training and poor evidence were cited as common barriers to NIRFI adoption. Conclusions: NIRFI use is common with high case volume, bariatric, foregut, and thoracic surgery practices associated with adoption. Barriers to use appear to be lack of awareness, low confidence in current evidence, and inadequate training. High quality randomized studies evaluating NIRFI are needed to improve confidence in current evidence; if deemed beneficial, training will be imperative for NIRFI adoption. © The Author(s) 2022.","{""Birch, D.

6863027,"Quantifying Abundance And Mapping Distribution Of Loggerhead Turtles In The Mediterranean Sea Using Aerial Surveys: Implications For Conservation","In the Mediterranean, incidental captures in fishing gear contribute to the high mortality of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Understanding the effects of bycatch is complex and requires robust knowledge of baseline population parameters such as abundance and density, as well as an understanding of animals' distribution in relation to commercial fishing efforts. Based on data collected during multi-species line transect aerial surveys conducted between 2009 and 2017, we present density and abundance estimates, corrected for availability bias, for a large sector of the central Mediterranean, discuss temporal and spatial patterns and provide Potential Biological Removal (PBR) values for the monitored areas. Sightings data were also used to evaluate the spatial and temporal usage areas. Strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in density, abundance and area usage emerged from the analysis, with turtles occurring in higher numbers in the deeper pelagic waters of the Tunisian Plateau, the Ionian Sea and the Gulf of Taranto, irrespective of the season. PBR values derived from this study are likely unsustainable. This paper investigates the implications of commercial fisheries for Mediterranean loggerhead turtles across an area rarely included in sea turtle monitoring and has the potential to be relevant towards informed management and conservation of this species and highlights the necessity of international collaborative efforts in the region.","{""Lauriano, Giancarlo"",""Panigada, Simone"",""Pierantonio, Nino""}","10.3390/d15121159",2024-09-27 23:38:40,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Caretta caretta; loggerhead turtle; abundance; density; bycatch; Mediterranean Sea; conservation""}"

6863525,"Integration Of Remotely Sensed And Model Data To Provide The Spatial Information Basis For Sustainable Landuse","Sustainable development is by now generally accepted as the paramount objective of environmental policy. Environmental applications of Earth observation, on the other hand, have been successfully demonstrated over a wide range of monitoring activities, mostly with the aim of describing the spatial distribution and time course of geophysical parameters and land surface structures. With landuse structures being of major influence on the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, and being also a highly suitable object of Earth observation, it is still an open question, however, in which way Earth observation data can be processed and integrated to provide an approximate indicator of sustainability. Based on an ecological sustainability model developed by Ripl and his co-workers at Berlin Technical University, this question was investigated in the framework of the joint project ""Development of a Land-Water-Management Concept to Decrease Matter Losses to Open Waters"" (Stor project), which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. Present results may be summarized as follows: 1. Apart from hydrological point measurements, there are several spatial parameters which are of indicative value as to sustainability, especially the spatio-temporal distribution of biomass, surface temperature, and precipitation. 2. To provide the spatial information basis for enhanced efficiency of immediate measures such as reforestation, agricultural extension etc., a global information system (GIS) concept was developed and demonstrated which is based on a landuse/vegetation classification derived from Landsat TM data, a digital evaluation mode (DEM) and a relief dependent water distribution model (WDM). Further implications such as the organisation of information systems which are to serve sustainability strategies are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

6863540,"Rapid Eco-Physical Impact Assessment Of Tropical Cyclones Using Geospatial Technology: A Case From Severe Cyclonic Storms Amphan","The tropical cyclones are very destructive during landfall, generating high wind speeds, heavy intensive rainfall, and severe storm surges with huge coastal inundations that have massive socioeconomic and ecological catastrophic effects on human beings and the economic well-being. The sizable ecological effects of cyclonic storms cannot be ignored because of the uncertainty of impact, intensity induced by a warming ocean, and sea level rise. The Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which falls under the category five classifications under the scheme of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), on the basis the maximum sustained wind speeds gusting up to 168 km/h affected parts of West Bengal and Odisha in India, and south-west Bangladesh between May 16 and 20, 2020. In this work, we have focused on the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore in Odisha, Purba Medinipur, and South Twenty-Four Parganas in West Bengal, India and, Khulna, Barisal division of Bangladesh that have been seriously affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan. The objective of the study is to analyze the eco-physical assessment of tropical cyclone Amphan using geospatial technology. Therefore, shoreline change detection and enhance vegetation index have been used in this research work to systematically analyze the eco-physical impact parameters of Cyclonic Storm Amphan using ortho-rectified Landsat 8/OLI imagery and MODIS dataset of USGS with high spatial resolutions of 30-500 m.

6863176,"A Robust Stochastic Approach In Correcting The Trmm Precipitation Product And Simulating Flood Features","Logical management and decision-making on water resources require reliable weather variables, where precipitation is considered the main weather variable. Accurate estimation of precipitation is the most important topic in hydrological studies. Due to the lack of a dense network and low temporal and spatial resolution levels at ground-level rain gauges, especially in developing countries, remote sensing methods have been used widely. In recent years, a combination of satellite-ground data on precipitation has led to a more accurate insight into precipitation and improved hydrological model performance. In this study, the Kosar Dam Basin in the Khuzestan province of Iran is selected as the research zone. The TRMM satellite data is used on 50 events to analyze the satellite precipitation data. Copula theory is then employed to check the uncertainties of precipitation estimation, and new precipitations are generated through original data and bias errors. A comparison of the results of the improved TRMM, which was bias-corrected by Gaussian copula, and ground-based rainfall demonstrated the efficacy of this method, with nearly 104\% and 51\% improvement in the CC and RMSE performance indicators, respectively. The HEC-HMS model was used to simulate flood features based on copula-corrected precipitation over different quartiles (10\%, 30\%, 50\%, 70\%, and 90\%) and rainfall duration (3, 6, 9, and 24 h). The obtained R-factor values show that the associated uncertainty decreases with rainfall duration, down to 46 and 20\% for discharge peak and volume, respectively. In general, the copula approach is a robust approach to improve the accuracy of the TRMM precipitation product for simulating hydrological processes.","{""Asadollah, Seyed Babak Haji Seyed"",""Hemmati, Naeim"",""Neshat, Aminreza"",""Sharafati, Ahmad""}","10.1007/s10661-022-10030-x",2024-07-19 20:13:14,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{calibration}","{""TRMM; Copula modeling; Bias correction; Rainfall-runoff""}"
6863620,"Measuring The Sustainability Of Russia's Arctic Cities","How sustainable are Russia's Arctic cities? Russia's far north metropolises are distinctive from other Arctic cities in terms of their large size, efforts to conquer nature, and big business' impact on the urban landscape. The Russian Arctic cities' Soviet-era design gave them compact and dense population structures. Such features led to many benefits for achieving sustainability, including more efficient energy use, a larger number of hospital beds, more numerous cultural amenities, and greater access to public transportation. However, Arctic cities outside of Russia have made progress in their own pursuit of sustainability through on-going investments, business development, educational resources, and solid waste management. By teasing out these distinctions, this article highlights urban features that make it possible for the cities to adapt to changes in the global environment and economy. In doing so, it provides the first multidisciplinary, comparative analysis of 46 Arctic cities employing historical, remote sensing, and quantitative methods. It demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the world's Arctic cities in their quest for sustainability and points to where they can learn from each other in adopting best practices.","{""Anisimov, Oleg"",""Badina, Svetlana"",""Burns, Charlene"",""Cho, Leena"",""DiNapoli, Benjamin"",""Jull, Matthew"",""Orttung, Robert W."",""Shaiman, Melissa"",""Shapovalova, Ksenia"",""Silinsky, Leah"",""Zhang, Emily"",""Zhiltcova, Yelena""}","10.1007/s13280-020-01395-9",2024-10-03 17:29:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""Arctic cities; Russia; Sustainability""}"
6903626,"Quantifying The Impacts Of Land Use Change On Flooding In Data-Poor Watersheds In El Salvador With Community-Based Model Calibration","Urbanization can decrease the flood mitigation capacity of a catchment, and these impacts can be measured with hydrologic modeling. Models are typically calibrated against observed discharge and satellite data, but in a developing country context like El Salvador, these data are often unavailable. Even if a model is well calibrated and tested, its ability to influence land use plans requires additional stakeholder engagement. This study uses a participatory modeling approach to calibrate a watershed model and estimate flood impacts of land use scenarios in two urbanizing catchments in El Salvador with a linked land use-catchment hydrology-hydraulic model calibrated on flood height observed by community members. This paper explores both the value of household flood observation in model calibration and differences of flood extent estimates for land use scenarios with an uncalibrated versus community-calibrated model. We find that calibration using household surveys improves model performance. Results of scenario modeling suggest that while past urbanization has significantly increased household flood exposure in one catchment, future land use scenarios that further urbanize or reforest large areas of either catchment have little effect on the number of houses at risk for flooding. The success of the participatory methodology to increase model accuracy and link results to local land use planning makes clear the contribution of social science to traditional hydrological methods to understand land use-flood links in data-poor catchments.",NA,"10.1007/s10113-015-0841-y",2024-10-03 21:46:33,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""participatory modeling""}",NA

6863431,"Identification Of Secondary Functional Areas And Functional Structure Analysis Based On Multisource Geographic Data","Obtaining high-precision information on functional areas is very important in urban spatial management. It has become common to integrate social perception data and high-resolution remote sensing images to identify functional areas. Based on Point of Interest (POI) data, a scoring evaluation model is constructed to identify functional zones in built-up areas. Two weight values in the model, the POI area weight and normalized kernel density value, are used in the calculation of the impact score. Functional areas are identified by the proportion of the influence score associated with each function type. The information corresponding to 10 first-level and 29 s-level functional areas is obtained by integrating the classification results for natural attributes in high-resolution images and the social attribute functional areas in the scoring evaluation model. The overall accuracy is 87.2\%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.86. The spatial structure characteristics of functional areas are analyzed based on spatial syntax, the location entropy index and so on.

6691561,"Reimagining the potential of Earth observations for ecosystem service assessments","The benefits nature provides to people, called ecosystem services, are increasingly recognized and accounted for in assessments of infrastructure development, agricultural management, conservation prioritization, and sustainable sourcing. These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.","{""Ramirez-Reyes, Carlos""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.150",2024-04-22 02:39:44,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Ecosystem benefits|Remote sensing|Monitoring|Research priorities""}"

Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to monitor the environmental quality in the LP quickly and accurately. To reveal the spatio-temporal changes in environmental quality in the LP from 2000 to 2020, we used the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products on the Google Earth Engine platform and constructed the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) through principal component analysis (PCA). Then, Sen-Mann-Kendall methods were applied to determine the changing trend of the environmental quality of the LP. Finally, natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the environmental quality were probed using a geographical detector model. The results showed that: (1) the average RSEI values in 2000, 2010 and 2020 were 0.396, 0.468 and 0.511, respectively, displaying an upward trend from 2000 to 2020, with a growth rate of 0.005 year(-1). The overall environment quality was moderate (0.4-0.6). (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the environmental quality was excellent in the southeast and poor in the northwest of the LP. The areas with improved environmental quality (84.51\%) were located in all the counties, whereas the areas with degraded environmental quality (8.11\%) occurred in the north and southeast of the study area. (3) Greenness, heat, wetness, dryness and land use types were prominent factors affecting RSEI throughout the study period; additionally, the total industrial gross domestic product showed a growing influence. The contribution of multi-factor interaction was stronger than that of single factors.

6863495,"A New Dynamic Approach For Statistical Optimization Of Gnss Radio Occultation Bending Angles For Optimal Climate Monitoring Utility","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based radio occultation (RO) is a satellite remote sensing technique providing accurate profiles of the Earth's atmosphere for weather and climate applications. Above about 30 km altitude, however, statistical optimization is a critical process for initializing the RO bending angles in order to optimize the climate monitoring utility of the retrieved atmospheric profiles. Here we introduce an advanced dynamic statistical optimization algorithm, which uses bending angles from multiple days of European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-range forecast and analysis fields, together with averaged-observed bending angles, to obtain background profiles and associated error covariance matrices with geographically varying background uncertainty estimates on a daily updated basis. The new algorithm is evaluated against the existing Wegener Center Occultation Processing System version 5.4 (OPSv5.4) algorithm, using several days of simulated MetOp and observed CHAMP and COSMIC data, for January and July conditions. We find the following for the new method's performance compared to OPSv5.4: 1.) it significantly reduces random errors (standard deviations), down to about half their size, and leaves less or about equal residual systematic errors (biases) in the optimized bending angles; 2.) the dynamic (daily) estimate of the background error correlation matrix alone already improves the optimized bending angles; 3.) the subsequently retrieved refractivity profiles and atmospheric (temperature) profiles benefit by improved error characteristics, especially above about 30 km. Based on these encouraging results, we work to employ similar dynamic error covariance estimation also for the observed bending angles and to apply the method to full months and subsequently to entire climate data records.

6862807,"Domain Recognition For Land Use Spatial Fractal Feature Based On Genetic Algorithm","The spatial pattern of land use is one of the most profound human-induced alterations to the Earth's surface. Its change can lead to severe problems in urban ecological environments, such as heavy traffic, the heat island effect, and the spread of epidemics. An accurate examination of urban land use characteristics is helpful both in understanding quantitatively and comprehensively urban land use spatial patterns, and in discovering the potential rules of urban land use change. Because of its advantages in describing randomness and self-similarity, the fractal dimension has been used widely to analyze spatial patterns, and great achievements have been made in recent decades. However, the scale domain is largely ignored when the value of the fractal dimension is used to explain spatial patterns. To some extent, this leads inevitably to analysis uncertainty, because the spatial self-similarity characteristics of land use exist within a specific scale range rather than across a geographic scale range. Hence, the identification of the scale domain related to the fractal dimension is more important than the computation itself. In addressing this problem, this paper presents a model for scale domain recognition, based on a genetic algorithm, to provide a meaningful range of fractal features existing in nature. Its objective function is to minimize the average from the sum of squared residuals that is derived from the result of the fitting of a scale-free region using discrete points. It can improve the computation accuracy of the fractal dimension significantly. Because of its abundant water resources, this study took the scale domain of the water fractal feature in Wuchang district as an example. A cloud-free image obtained by the Quickbird satellite, was classified and used to extract land use information by using a combination of the decision tree method and supervised classification. A general framework and three genetic operators for the scale domain recognition of the land use spatial fractal feature were designed to identify the scale domain of the radius of the fractal dimension for water. To validate our model, its results were compared with three other methods used commonly for scale domain recognition: the artificial judgment method, the correlation coefficient method, and the strengthening coefficient method. The results indicate that different scale-less bands are derived by the four methods of scale domain identification. The scale-less band of the correlation coefficient method is significantly wider than that obtained by using the other three models. This results in a relatively small determination coefficient, indicating low accuracy. The genetic algorithm has the narrowest scale-less band and the best degree of statistical fitness of the four methods. Based on standard deviation, the four models can be ranked in the following descending order: the artificial judgment method (0.22), the correlation coefficient method (0.16), the strengthening coefficient method (0.13), and the genetic algorithm (0.08). Accordingly, the radius of the fractal dimension of water changes with the different scale-less bands derived from these four methods. The radius dimension derived from the genetic algorithm is 1.285, which suggests that the trend of the spatial distribution characteristics becomes gradually weaker moving from the center to the surroundings. This agrees with the spatial distribution of water information derived from the satellite image of Wuchang district. It reveals that it is critically important and imperative to promote the genetic algorithm for accurate identification of the scale domain of the fractal dimension. These findings are helpful for urban management departments in determining land use change, but also they provide a scientific reference for urban land use planning to ensure that land resources are used effectively.","{""Chen, X.

6903523,"Flood Effects On An Alaskan Stream Restoration Project: The Value Of Long-Term Monitoring","On a nationwide basis, few stream restoration projects have long-term programs in place to monitor the effects of floods on channel and floodplain configuration and floodplain vegetation, but long-term and event-based monitoring is required to measure the effects of these stochastic events and to use the knowledge for adaptive management and the design of future projects. This paper describes a long-term monitoring effort (15 years) on a stream restoration project in Glen Creek in Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. The stream channel and floodplain of Glen Creek had been severely degraded over a period of 80 years by placer mining for gold, which left many reaches with unstable and incised streambeds without functioning vegetated floodplains. The objectives of the original project, initiated in 1991, were to develop and test methods for the hydraulic design of channel and floodplain morphology and for floodplain stabilization and riparian habitat recovery, and to conduct research and monitoring to provide information for future projects in similar degraded watersheds. Monitoring methods included surveyed stream cross-sections, vegetation plots, and aerial, ground, and satellite photos. In this paper we address the immediate and outlying effects of a 25-year flood on the stream and floodplain geometry and riparian vegetation. The long-term monitoring revealed that significant channel widening occurred following the flood, likely caused by excessive upstream sediment loading and the fairly slow development of floodplain vegetation in this climate. Our results illustrated design flaws, particularly in regard to identification and analysis of sediment sources and the dominant processes of channel adjustment. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.",NA,"10.1111/j.1752-1688.2009.00373.x",2024-10-03 21:53:34,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863543,"Ecosystem Service Loss In Response To Agricultural Expansion In The Small Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China: Process, Driver And Management","Converting natural ecosystems to cultivated land, driven by human activities, has been considered a significant driver of limiting the delivery of ecosystem services (ES). The ES loss in the past was mainly caused by agricultural activities that have been taken to meet people's needs in Northeast China. Quantifying historical declining ecosystem service values is essential to facilitate sustainable development. In this study, remote sensing images were used to investigate the history of cultivated land expansion over the last five decades. Additionally, ES variations caused by agricultural expansion since 1965 were quantified in the Small Sanjiang Plain (SSP), Northeast China. From the results, cultivated land expanded from 3.97\% of the total SSP area to 66.40\% from 1965 to 2015 (approximately 898.23 million ha), of which paddy field expanded drastically from 0\% to 55.93\%. Variations in cultivated land resulted in a loss of ecosystem service values by 11,893.85 million dollars, of which 62.98 million dollars were caused by the internal conversion between cultivation during 1965-2015. Agricultural expansion accelerated the export of agricultural products function, while it decreased almost all other functions, especially hydrological regulation and freshwater supply function. For future sustainability of the SSP, some suggestions, such as restoring natural ecosystems, planting trees between cultivated land, coculture systems, and winter-flooding of paddy rice were provided in our study.","{""Chen, Jing"",""Yan, Fengqin"",""Yu, Lingxue"",""Zhang, Shuwen""}","10.3390/su12062430",2024-07-15 15:58:19,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""cultivated land; ecosystem service value; land use change; the Small Sanjiang Plain; remote sensing""}"

Assessing these health benefits is a key step for managing urban green spaces for human health and wellbeing in cities. In this study, we assessed the change of health benefits generated by urban green spaces in 28 megacities worldwide between 2005 and 2015 by using availability and accessibility as proxy indicators. We first mapped land covers of 28 megacities using 10,823 scenes of Landsat images and a random forest classifier running on Google Earth Engine. We then calculated the availability and accessibility of urban green spaces using the land cover maps and gridded population data. The results showed that the mean availability of urban green spaces in these megacities increased from 27.63% in 2005 to 31.74% in 2015. The mean accessibility of urban green spaces increased from 65.76% in 2005 to 72.86% in 2015.

6863677,"Cropwatch Agroclimatic Indicators (Cwais) For Weather Impact Assessment On Global Agriculture","CropWatch agroclimatic indicators (CWAIs) are a monitoring tool developed by the CropWatch global crop monitoring system in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; www.cropwatch.com.cn, Wu et al Int J Digital Earth 7(2):113-137, 2014, Wu et al Remote Sens 7:3907-3933, 2015). Contrary to most other environmental and agroclimatic indicators, they are ""agronomic value-added"", i.e. they are spatial values averaged over agricultural areas only and they include a weighting that enhances the contribution of the areas with the largest production potential. CWAIs can be computed for any time interval (starting from dekads) and yield one synthetic value per variable over a specific area and time interval, for instance a national annual value. Therefore, they are very compatible with socio-economic and other variables that are usually reported at regular time intervals over administrative units, such as national environmental or agricultural statistics. Two of the CWAIs are satellite-based (RAIN and Photosynthetically Active radiation, PAR) while the third is ground based (TEMP, air temperature); capitals are used when specifically referring to CWAIs rather than the climate variables in general. The paper first provides an overview of some common agroclimatic indicators, describing their procedural, systemic and normative features in subsequent sections, following the terminology of Binder et al Environ Impact Assess Rev 30:71-81 (2010). The discussion focuses on the systemic and normative aspects: the CWAIs are assessed in terms of their coherent description of the agroclimatic crop environment, at different spatial scales (systemic). The final section shows that the CWAIs retain key statistical properties of the underlying climate variables and that they can be compared to a reference value and used as monitoring and early warning variables (normative).","{""Chen, Bo"",""Feng, Xueliang"",""Gommes, Rene"",""Li, Zhongyuan"",""Wu, Bingfang"",""Zeng, Hongwei"",""Zhang, Ning""}","10.1007/s00484-016-1199-7",2024-07-18 23:26:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""Crop Watch; Crop monitoring; Agroclimatic indicators; Early warning; Scaling""}"
6447822,"Landsat continuity: Issues and opportunities for land cover monitoring","Initiated in 1972, the Landsat program has provided a continuous record of earth observation for 35 years. The assemblage of Landsat spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, over a reasonably sized image extent, results in imagery that can be processed to represent land cover over large areas with an amount of spatial detail that is absolutely unique and indispensable for monitoring, management, and scientific activities. Recent technical problems with the two existing Landsat satellites, and delays in the development and launch of a successor, increase the likelihood that a gap in Landsat continuity may occur. In this communication, we identify the key features of the Landsat program that have resulted in the extensive use of Landsat data for large area land cover mapping and monitoring. We then augment this list of key features by examining the data needs of existing large area land cover monitoring programs. Subsequently, we use this list as a basis for reviewing the current constellation of earth observation satellites to identify potential alternative data sources for large area land cover applications. Notions of a virtual constellation of satellites to meet large area land cover mapping and monitoring needs are also presented. Finally, research priorities that would facilitate the integration of these alternative data sources into existing large area land cover monitoring programs are identified. Continuity of the Landsat program and the measurements provided are critical for scientific, environmental, economic, and social purposes. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Landsat; there are no other systems in orbit, or planned for launch in the short-term, that can duplicate or approach replication, of the measurements and information conferred by Landsat. While technical and political options are being pursued, there is no satellite image data stream poised to enter the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive should system failures occur to Landsat-5 and -7.","{""Cohen, Warren B."",""Goward, Samuel N."",""Herold, Martin"",""Irons, James R."",""Loveland, Thomas R."",""Masek, Jeffrey G."",""White, Joanne C."",""Woodcock, Curtis E."",""Wulder, Michael A.""}","10.1016/j.rse.2007.07.004",NA,NA,NA,2008,"{}","{""Change detection"",""Land cover"",Landsat,""Landsat Data Continuity Mission"",""Large area"",Monitoring,""Remote sensing""}"

6863562,"Ningbo Atmospheric Environment Analysis And Regulating Countermeasure Based On Urban Climatic Map","Rapid urbanization has changed the urban climate and environment. As a result, many climatic and environmental problems have emerged. Valid urban climatic environment analysis and regulating countermeasures are required in order to cope with and mitigate these issues. An urban climatic map provides important guidance for the planning and regulation of the urban climatic environment. Based on a traditional urban climatic map, this research proposes a new method of building an urban climatic map that considers all seasons and multiple environmental elements. The urban area in Ningbo City, with its complicated underlying surfaces and obvious seasonal climate characteristics, was used as a case study. The technical means, including remote-sensing inversion, spatial analysis of geographical information system (GIS), and mesoscale numerical model simulation, were comprehensively applied to conduct a multi-season analysis and evaluation of the urban thermal load, air pollution, ventilation potential, wind field, and overall urban climatic environment. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the urban thermal load and air pollutants is characterized by significant seasonal and spatial differences in the principal elements of the formation of an urban climatic environment. Ningbo City is affected by both thermal load and air pollution in spring and summer, affected only by air pollution in the winter, and only slightly affected by both thermal load and air pollution in the autumn. The spatial patterns of ventilation potential are similar in all seasons. Remarkable seasonal and spatial differences are presented, as the wind environment is complex and subject to change. By conducting an overall analysis on urban climatic environments, we found that areas with high and middle values of urban climatic environment are mainly distributed in forests, croplands, and water bodies. Areas with a high risk of urban climatic environment are located in the heavy chemical industrial zones along the coast of Beilun District, Zhenhai District, as well as the southern part of Hangzhou Bay. Areas with an intermediate risk of urban climatic environments are found in the regions where large amounts of industrial factories are clustered, such as the eastern Jiangbei District, eastern and western sides of Yinzhou District, Cixi urban area, and northeast part of the Fenghua urban area. Based on the above analysis, the planning schemes of urban ventilation channels and the regulating countermeasures of climatic environments are further proposed. These include two first-class ventilation channels, five second-class ventilation channels, three third-class bidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by land-sea breezes, twelve third-class unidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by land-sea breezes, thirteen third-class unidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by mountain-valley breezes, and seven types of countermeasures for urban climatic environment regulation. The method of building an urban climatic map considering all seasons and multiple environmental factors raised by this research is applicable to the analysis and evaluation research of the monsoon climate zones with complicated climatic environments. It may also improve urban thermal load and atmospheric environmental quality and ease the problems of urban climatic environments in all seasons. It may do so through ventilation channel planning and formulating and implementing relevant regulatory countermeasures so as to provide support for urban environmental protection, meteorological and planning departments, and promote sustainable urban development and the construction of an ecological city. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

6863360,"A Survey Of Natural Aggregate Properties And Characteristics Important In Remote Sensing And Airborne Geophysics","Natural aggregate is vital to the construction industry. Although natural aggregate is a high volume/low value commodity that is abundant, new sources are becoming increasingly difficult to find and develop because of rigid industry specifications, political considerations, development and transportation costs, and environmental concerns. There are two primary sources of natural aggregate: (1) exposed or near-surface bedrock that can be crushed, and (2) deposits of sand and gravel. Remote sensing and airborne geophysics detect surface and near-surface phenomena, and may be useful for detecting and mapping potential aggregate sources; however, before a methodology for applying these techniques can be developed, it is necessary to understand the type, distribution, physical properties, and characteristics of natural aggregate deposits. The distribution of potential aggregate sources is closely tied to local geologic history. Conventional exploration for natural aggregate deposits has been largely a ground-based operation, although aerial photographs and topographic maps have been extensively used to target possible deposits. Today, the exploration process also considers factors such as the availability of the land, space and water supply for processing, political and environmental factors, and distance from the market; exploration and planning cannot be separated. There are many physical properties and characteristics by which to judge aggregate material for specific applications; most of these properties and characteristics pertain only to individual aggregate particles. The application of remote sensing and airborne geophysical measurements to detecting and mapping potential aggregate sources, however, is based on intrinsic bulk physical properties and extrinsic characteristics of the deposits that can be directly measured, mathematically derived from measurement, or interpreted with remote sensing and geophysical data. © 1995 Oxford UniversityPress.","{""Knepper Jr, D.

The results of this type of risk analysis can be used to inform policy-making and prioritisation of resources for flood management. It can form the starting point for more detailed strategic and local-scale flood risk assessments. The national-scale risk assessment methodology outlined in this paper makes use of information on the location, standard of protection and condition of flood defences in England and Wales, together with datasets of floodplain extent, topography, occupancy and asset values. The flood risk assessment was applied to all of England and Wales in 2002 at which point the expected annual damage from flooding was estimated to be approximately (sic)1 billion. This figure is comparable with records of recent flood damage. The methodology has subsequently been applied to examine the effects of climate and socio-economic change 50 and 80 years in the future. The analysis predicts increasing flood risk unless current flood management policies, practices and investment levels are changed - up to 20-fold increase in real terms economic risk by the 2080s in the scenario with highest economic growth.

6903556,"Tissue-Level Biomarkers In Sentinel Slugs As Cost-Effective Tools To Assess Metal Pollution In Soils","In previous laboratory experiments, slugs were shown to be sensitive to metal pollution. Therefore, they might be invaluable instruments for biological assessment of soil pollution. The present investigation was carried out to validate previous laboratory results in a field study. Slugs were collected from an abandoned copper mine (Parys mountain top, PMT), from a site 7 km away from the mine (Parys mountain bottom, PMB), and from a clean site (Snowdonia Cwm Idwal, SCI) in Wales in early July 1994. Whole soft body and digestive gland Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were measured by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The digestive gland was the main tissue for metal accumulation, with significant differences in tissue metal levels between samples from different sites. PMB presented the highest Cd and Zn levels and the highest Cu levels were found at PMT. In addition, metals were demonstrated in situ by autometallography as black silver deposits (BSD) on histological sections of digestive gland tissue. The extent of BSD within lysosomes of digestive cells was closely related to metal levels determined by AAS. Histochemistry revealed that Ca metabolism and structural and reserve connective tissues might be altered in slugs living in metal-polluted soils. Finally, tissue-level biomarkers of biological effect [mean epithelial thickness (MET), mean diverticular radius (MDR), mean luminal radius (MLR), MET/MDR and MLR/MET] were quantified by image analysis of digestive gland histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. MET and MDR values of slugs collected from SCI were high, while slugs from PMB presented low MLR/MET associated with environmental stress induced by metal exposure. We conclude that exposure and effect biomarkers recorded in sentinel slugs could be sensitive, quick, and cheap indices of metal pollution in soils. A Slug Watch monitoring program could be developed similar to the Mussel Watch program, which is currently applied to assess environmental quality in coastal and estuarine areas.",NA,"10.1007/s002449900301",2024-09-30 21:17:48,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""sentinel slugs"",spurious}",NA

Analysis of SDG indicator 11.3.1-Land-use efficiency based on functional urban boundaries-provides a globally harmonized avenue for tracking changes in urban settlements in different areas. In this study, a methodology was developed to map built-up areas using time-series of Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. By fusing the mapping results with four available land-cover products-GlobeLand30, GHS-Built, GAIA and GLC\_FCS-2020-a new built-up area product (BTH\_BU) was generated for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China for the time period 2000-2020. Using the BTH\_BU product, functional urban boundaries were created, and changes in the size of the urban areas and their form were analyzed for the 13 cities in the BTH region from 2000 to 2020. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of SDG 11.3.1 indicators were analyzed for these cities. The results showed that the urban built-up area could be extracted effectively using the BTH\_BU method, giving an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.85, respectively. The overall ratio of the land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR) in the BTH region fluctuated from 1.142 in 2000-2005 to 0.946 in 2005-2010, 2.232 in 2010-2015 and 1.538 in 2015-2020.

6862770,"The Livable Urban Landscape: Gis And Remote Sensing Extracted Land Use Assessment For Urban Livability In Changchun Proper, China","Despite the popularity of the term urban livability, it is often used by different groups under different circumstances. A broader understanding of urban livability is that it concerns the quality of life in any human living environment. The World Health Organization, among many others, suggests a four-dimension assessment system based on the concepts of convenience, amenity, health and safety that can be used to evaluate any cities' potential livability. Following this proposal, the current study taps into the power of GIS and Remote Sensing technologies to generate a set of urban livability evaluating indicators via extracted land use information. Using the city proper of Changchun, Jilin Province of China as an example, the study extracts fifteen individual land use indicators from topographic maps and a remote sensing imagery. A principal component analysis-based approach was used to build an urban livability index with the fifteen indicators. Furthermore, with detailed examination of relevant studies, national documents and local fieldwork, this research also establishes potential benchmark values for all fifteen livability evaluating indicators for comparison purposes. Results suggest that slightly more than half of Changchun's city proper is above the livability benchmark in the framework of the current study. Residents' access to parks and open spaces is a major lagging factor for the city proper's livability.

6863283,"Classification Of Hurricane Hazards: The Importance Of Rainfall","A new hazard index is presented to estimate and rank hurricane severity according to a storm's damage and death toll after landfall on the continental United States. The index uses three characteristic meteorological aspects of hurricanes: wind, torrential rainfall, and storm surge, each with an individual subindex. Rainfall is identified as an important and frequently dominant hazard in terms of damage and death toll, but is not included in any current hazard scales or indices. The new rainfall subindex adopts rainfall intensity, stormrainfall area, and the forward speed of the system to estimate the rainfall hazard. The new hazard index, applied to recent U.S. hurricanes (2003-12), has better skill than existing scales in terms of ranking the severity of the events by both damage and death toll. Further, the index can provide good quantitative estimates of dollar values for damage and death toll, whereas previous models provide only a scale or ranking.

6863493,"Impacts Of Modern Mechanised Skidding On The Natural And Cultural Heritage Of The Polish Carpathian Mountains","The aim of the research was to determine the scale and forms of logging road impacts on the natural environment and residual cultural heritage of Ruthenian Highlanders that characterise the Polish part of the north-eastern Carpathians. To this end, we used LiDAR-derived DEM to detect and map forest roads and skid trails, and to estimate road density, in 60 forest divisions sampled at random from among the 2639 km2 of forest managed in the above region by the State Forests National Forest Holding. The determined road network was then validated by GPS ground control. Supplementary, detailed LiDAR data were used to detect features of the past cultural landscape, and to determine the interference in that due to contemporary logging roads. Overall skidder traffic was estimated on the basis of a thorough analysis of State Forests documents, including legal acts, guidelines, management plans, detailed databases and maps of planned cuts. LiDAR data proved to be an adequate tool in the mapping of the network of logging roads present under the tree canopy, although it slightly underestimates road density in a densely vegetated, post-landslide topography. Our LiDAR-assessed density of Carpathian logging roads (at 108.5–140.7 m ha−1, including skid trails) is nevertheless among the highest reported in the literature, and one that far exceeds recommended values. Spatial pattern analysis further revealed the unfavourable phenomenon of multiple parallel roads forming contiguous areas of disturbed soil and constituting dispersal paths for invasive plants. Many examples of cultural remains being run over and destroyed by skidders could also be reported. The observed process of log extraction is one of the least sustainable aspects to forest management in the Carpathians, and our results emphasise very clearly the need for rules to support the preservation of cultural heritage in forested areas, as well as improved tools by which skidding practices can be monitored. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","{""Affek, A.

6862776,"Monitoring Of Nitrogen Concentration In Soybean Leaves At Multiple Spatial Vertical Scales Based On Spectral Parameters","Nitrogen is a fundamental component for building amino acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) serves as a key indicator for assessing plant growth and development. Monitoring LNC provides insights into the absorption and utilization of nitrogen from the soil, offering valuable information for rational nutrient management. This, in turn, contributes to optimizing nutrient supply, enhancing crop yields, and minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Efficient and non-destructive estimation of crop LNC is of paramount importance for on-field crop management. Spectral technology, with its advantages of repeatability and high-throughput observations, provides a feasible method for obtaining LNC data. This study explores the responsiveness of spectral parameters to soybean LNC at different vertical scales, aiming to refine nitrogen management in soybeans. This research collected hyperspectral reflectance data and LNC data from different leaf layers of soybeans. Three types of spectral parameters, nitrogen-sensitive empirical spectral indices, randomly combined dual-band spectral indices, and ""three-edge"" parameters, were calculated. Four optimal spectral index selection strategies were constructed based on the correlation coefficients between the spectral parameters and LNC for each leaf layer. These strategies included empirical spectral index combinations (Combination 1), randomly combined dual-band spectral index combinations (Combination 2), ""three-edge"" parameter combinations (Combination 3), and a mixed combination (Combination 4). Subsequently, these four combinations were used as input variables to build LNC estimation models for soybeans at different vertical scales using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients between the LNC and spectral parameters reached the highest values in the upper soybean leaves, with most parameters showing significant correlations with the LNC (p < 0.05). Notably, the reciprocal difference index (VI6) exhibited the highest correlation with the upper-layer LNC at 0.732, with a wavelength combination of 841 nm and 842 nm. In constructing the LNC estimation models for soybeans at different leaf layers, the accuracy of the models gradually improved with the increasing height of the soybean plants. The upper layer exhibited the best estimation performance, with a validation set coefficient of determination (R-2) that was higher by 9.9\% to 16.0\% compared to other layers. RF demonstrated the highest accuracy in estimating the upper-layer LNC, with a validation set R2 higher by 6.2\% to 8.8\% compared to other models. The RMSE was lower by 2.1\% to 7.0\%, and the MRE was lower by 4.7\% to 5.6\% compared to other models. Among different input combinations, Combination 4 achieved the highest accuracy, with a validation set R-2 higher by 2.3\% to 13.7\%. In conclusion, by employing Combination 4 as the input, the RF model achieved the optimal estimation results for the upper-layer LNC, with a validation set R-2 of 0.856, RMSE of 0.551, and MRE of 10.405\%. The findings of this study provide technical support for remote sensing monitoring of soybean LNCs at different spatial scales.","{""Chen, Guofu"",""Cui, Shihao"",""Li, Zhijun"",""Limami, Anis"",""Liu, Yuchen"",""Sun, Tao"",""Wang, Zhangkai"",""Xie, Weihao"",""Yang, Wanli"",""Zhang, Fucang"",""Zhang, Zhitao"",""Zhao, Yizheng"",""Zhu, Zhiheng""}","10.3390/plants13010140",2024-07-19 23:47:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{calibration}","{""soybean; remote sensing; hyperspectral; leaf nitrogen content; spectral parameters""}"
6903532,"How Historical Land Use/Land Cover Changes Affected Ecosystem Services In Lake Pamvotis, Greece","Historic land changes reflect human pressure in aquatic ecosystems. The value of littoral and riparian zones for lakes is of outmost importance for their hydrology, ecology and support of ecosystem services. The last 75 years altered the landscape mosaic of Lake Pamvotis affecting those habitats. In such an ancient, urban, Mediterranean shallow lake, historic black and white aerial photographs and satellite images were screened in 25 years timestep, from 1945 for extracting land use/land cover changes. The classification took place in two buffer zones (50 m and 500 m). The changes are assessed with respect to their possible impact in water-related ecosystem services. Ecosystem services values were further calculated historically along with landscape ecology indices. The research revealed an extreme landscape makeover until 1995 with detrimental effects in the riparian habitats, with augmented pressure in the 0-50 m buffer. Artificial areas covered 21% in 1995 when in 1945 they occupied only 9%. Total area ecosystem services values rised at the expense of some provisioning and regulating services. As for landscape homogenization and fragmentation, it was already affected by human. Through this research, new ways of studying water bodies can be developed, by following the pressures’ and alterations’ evolution, aiming at better urban and management planning. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,"10.1080/10807039.2020.1855575",2024-10-01 17:27:38,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{""terra = mediterranean""}",NA
6691695,"Benefits of meteorological  services in South Eastern Europe","The study evaluated the impacts and potential benefits of meteorological and hydrological information services in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro. The services were analysed for the sectors of transport, construction industry, energy production, flood protection and agriculture production. The study was part of a larger project for the development of weather and climate observation networks and meteorological services in South Eastern Europe countries. In Albania advanced meteorological information services would produce annual savings worth 24 to 26 million euro. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the potential annual benefits were estimated to be about 10 to 22 million euro, in the FYR Macedonia 12 to 40 million euro and in Moldova 12 to 19 million euro per year. For Montenegro the data available did not enable the differentiation from Serbia for aviation and agriculture sectors. For road transport, construction industry and flood protection the annual savings resulting from better hydrometeorological information would be 1 to 3 million euro. Due to the lack of source information only part of the approximate potential benefits could be estimated at magnitude level, even though, the results show that hydrometeorological services are beneficial and worth developing further. The benefits are to a large extent due to higher predictability rates and better planning of operations as well as better preparedness for accidents and the reduction of human and material losses caused by these accidents. The realisation of the potential benefits requires comprehensive development of the hydrometeorological service systems. This means further development of observation infrastructure, data and transmission systems as well as service processes, operation models and know-how. Not only should the services be developed, but their availability and usability should be improved. The utilisation of communications technology should be enhanced and the awareness of the benefits of various services should be raised.","{""Hautala, Raine""}","978-951-38-7170-3",2024-04-26 23:12:57,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2008,"{}","{""information services|meteorological information|hydrological information|socioeconomic benefits|Alba""}"
6862847,"Changemask: Deep Multi-Task Encoder-Transformer-Decoder Architecture For Semantic Change Detection","Multi-temporal high spatial resolution earth observation makes it possible to detect complex urban land surface changes, which is a significant and challenging task in remote sensing communities. Previous works mainly focus on binary change detection (BCD) based on modern technologies, e.g., deep fully convolutional network (FCN), whereas the deep network architecture for semantic change detection (SCD) is insufficiently explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task encoder-transformer-decoder architecture (ChangeMask) designed by exploring two important inductive biases: sematic-change causal relationship and temporal symmetry. ChangeMask decouples the SCD into a temporal-wise semantic segmentation and a BCD, and then integrates these two tasks into a general encoder-transformer-decoder framework. In the encoder part, we design a semantic-aware encoder to model the semantic-change causal relationship. This encoder is only used to learn semantic representation and then learn change representation from semantic representation via a later transformer module. In this way, change representation can constrain semantic representation during training, which introduces a regularization to reduce the risk of overfitting. To learn a robust change representation from semantic representation, we propose a temporal-symmetric transformer (TST) to guarantee temporal symmetry for change representation and keep it discriminative. Based on the above semantic representation and change representation, we adopt simple multi-task decoders to output semantic change map. Benefiting from the differentiable building blocks, ChangeMask can be trained by a multi-task loss function, which significantly simplifies the whole pipeline of applying ChangeMask. The comprehensive experimental results on two large-scale SCD datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ChangeMask in SCD. Besides, to demonstrate the potential value in real-world applications, e.g., automatic urban analysis and decision-making, we deploy the ChangeMask to map a large geographic area covering 30 km2 with 300 million pixels.

To evaluate the potential utility of bathymetric LiDAR for applications of this kind, we compared detailed surveys collected using wading and sonar techniques with measurements from the United States Geological Survey's hybrid topographic/bathymetric Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL). These comparisons, based upon data collected from the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, California, and the Colorado River, Colorado, demonstrated that environmental conditions and postprocessing algorithms can influence the accuracy and utility of these surveys and must be given consideration. These factors can lead to mapping errors that can have a direct bearing on derivative analyses such as hydraulic modeling and habitat assessment. We discuss the water and substrate characteristics of the sites, compare the conventional and remotely sensed river-bed topographies, and investigate the laser waveforms reflected from submerged targets to provide an evaluation as to the suitability and accuracy of the EAARL system and associated processing algorithms for riverine mapping applications. © 2012 American Water Resources Association.","{""Kinzel, P.

The stability and continuity of the ESVs were comprehensively characterized using coefficients of variation and the Hurst exponent. The degree of coherence between ESVs and economic growth (represented by gross domestic product GDP) on the same temporal and spatial scales was analyzed using ecological-economic coordination (EEC) models. The results show that (1) from 2001 to 2015 the total ESV and the ESV per unit area in the Yellow River Basin generally showed a U-shaped pattern (decreasing slightly then increasing rapidly). (2) The areas with increasing ESVs made up approximately 55.6% of the total area of the river basin. The areas with a decreasing pattern were mainly in the west and north of the Yellow River Basin. (3) The stability and continuity of the ESVs showed a clustered, compact distribution. (4) The most common level of EEC was slightly uncoordinated followed by slightly coordinated and highly coordinated. The proportion of coordinated areas was relatively higher in cultivated land and the lowest in built-up land. © 2020 by the authors.

6863161,"Evaluation Of A Ubiquitous And Interoperable Computerised System For Remote Monitoring Of Ambulatory Post-Operative Pain: A Randomised Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: For economic reasons, i.e., to reduce costs of in-hospital patient accommodations, constant pressure has been applied in recent years to increase the percentage of ambulatory surgeries. Effective control of post-operative pain after ambulatory surgery is challenging to all health professionals. Computerised systems are being implemented more frequently for remote patient monitoring, including during the at-home post-operative period. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of delivering a computerised system, developed in-house, for remote pain monitoring. It evaluates the user-friendliness of the system and the extent of patient compliance. Finally, a comparative assessment of the system is made with respect to the quality of pain treatment in ambulatory surgery. METHODS: The participants included 32 adults, aged 18-75, randomly assigned to a control group or to a computerised treatment group. The primary treatment outcome was measured by pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) reported several times per day during a five-day monitoring period, using an electronic pain diary combined with a web-based personal health record. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the proposed system for pain management. Its handling was user-friendly, without requiring advanced skill or prior experience. In addition, the results showed that the guidance of health care professionals is essential to patients' satisfaction and positive experience with the system. There were no significant group differences with respect to improvements in the quality of pain treatment; however, this can be explained by the low pain scores registered in both groups, related to the type of surgical interventions recruited and the degrees of pain that are easily treated. To evaluate the benefits from a patient-centred perspective, studies of major ambulatory surgeries or of patients in chronic pain, including oncologic and non-oncologic pain resistant to treatment, are necessary. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.","{""Araújo, P."",""Da Costa, M.

6447821,"What’s It Worth? Estimating the Potential Value of Early Warnings of Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms for Managing Freshwater Reservoirs in Kansas, United States","Cyanobacterial blooms are an issue drawing increasing concern in freshwater lakes and reservoirs in the United States due to the real and sometimes perceived harms they can cause through cyanotoxin production or other effects. These types of blooms are often referred to as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). Cyanotoxin exposure can potentially lead to human health effects through recreation and consumption of drinking water and may impact fisheries, wildlife, domestic pets, and livestock. Characterizing the societal impacts of cyanotoxin production, exposure, and effects and estimating the potential value of information of an early warning system can inform and support freshwater lake and reservoir management decisions and future research directions. A Bayesian decision tree analysis was utilized to identify uses, users, and benefits of the information provided by this research. Specifically, the potential value related to a cyanoHAB early warning system, based on potential toxicity, was analyzed that would provide information two additional days earlier relative to cyanoHAB toxicity. The evaluation considers the application of this information for freshwater lake management - whether or not to post an advisory or warning to avoid recreational water contact. The model was parameterized with data from the state of Kansas and the value of avoided foregone recreation and avoided health effects was derived. The estimated annual value of information ranges between $565 thousand to $2.3 million (2018 United States Dollars (USD)) for the state of Kansas alone based on provided assumptions. The results demonstrate a lower bound of the value of a cyanoHAB early warning system and suggest additional research to understand how the use and value of this information could support research prioritization and further illustrate the return on research investment. This analysis does not incorporate the full suite of potential societal costs that may be associated with a cyanoHAB event such as drinking water treatment, impacts to irrigation, or power generation.","{""Loftin, Keith"",""Pindilli, Emily J.""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2022,"{}",NA
6691552,"A Design for a Data and Information Service to Address the Knowledge Needs of the Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus and Strategies to Facilitate Its Implementation","Food security is essential to sustain human societies. Food production flourishes when water, energy, and land are abundant, but more often it is limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. In particular, food production is limited by the relatively fixed amount of water that circulates in the hydrosphere, the lack of new land for crops in many countries, and the depletion of critical minerals and fossil fuels in many source regions. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distills discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops reviewed ways to enhance the sustainability of the W-E-F Nexus through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both with management for better planning and decision-making. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential application of an integrated data and information system to enhance water, energy, and food sustainability. In particular, this paper's objective is to explore how a multisector W-E-F Nexus data and information system could be developed and operated to meet the planning and decision-making information needs of practitioners and to facilitate the implementation of the W-E-F Nexus concept. This “Hypothesis and Theory” paper provides a hypothesis and system design and proposes steps that could be taken to implement and test the system in a W-E-F Nexus environment. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a central role in facilitating paradigm shifts that reinforce the W-E-F Nexus by explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and appropriate Sustainable Development Goals.","{""Lawford, Richard""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00056",2024-04-23 22:02:33,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""W-E-F Nexus|data"",""information system|satellite observations|decision-making|in situ observations""}"
6863006,"Forest Fire Monitoring Using Airborne Optical Full Spectrum Remote Sensing Data","Forest fire is one of the major forest disturbances, which directly affects forest ecosystem structure, carbon cycle, even global climate change. In recent years, the technical progresses of aerial platforms and onboard sensors have effectively improved the capability of airborne remote sensing to detect and monitor forest fires. As a result, many forest fire applications have been carried out with airborne data, including the forest fuel assessment, evaluation of forest fire potential and prevention, forest fire monitoring and situation evaluation during firefighting, post-fire damage assessment, ecosystem management and restoration. This paper introduces an integrated airborne remote sensing system, i.e., Chinese Academy of Forestry's LiDAR, Thermal, CCD and Hyperspectral (CAF-LiTCHy) airborne observation system. The CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system is equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner, thermal infrared camera, CCD camera and hyperspectral scanner and can obtain the corresponding data, simultaneously. The parameters of these sensors and the data processing scheme were described to show the advanced and scientific nature of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system. Moreover, the detailed ""image - spectral - temperature - height"" information of forest benefits the aforementioned applications. Here, the Xichang '3.30 Forest Fire' in Sichuan Province was selected as a case study to test the capability of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system in post-fire survey and disaster assessment. The burn severity levels can be interpreted from the high spatial resolution CCD image directly. Meanwhile, the LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM) shows the different burn severities of the canopy in spatial and vertical structural level. The vegetation indices calculated from hyperspectral image indicate that the pigment content and water content of canopy decrease simultaneously. The thermal information shows a higher temperature in high burn severity areas than other areas due to lots of charcoals from fire. Finally, with the combination of the CCD, CHM, spectral and thermal temperature information, the distribution of burn severity levels of the study area was mapped. The CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system can obtain forest fire information and offer fire-related parameters effectively. The design of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system is advanced and scientific, and the acquired data are in high resolution, multiple dimensions and good geo-location consistency. The efficiency and stability for airborne data collection provide rapid response for fire events. Furthermore, the CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system has the potential to provide support for fire prevention, fire risk forecast and early warning, firefighting decision-making, post-fire damage assessment and ecological restoration. © 2020, Science Press.

6903522,"Impact Of The Urbanisation Process In The Availability Of Ecosystem Services In A Tropical Ecotone Area","Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified. © 2018, The Author(s).",NA,"10.1007/s10021-018-0270-0",2024-09-27 18:38:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863613,"Mapping Spatial Variability Of Foliar Nitrogen In Coffee (Coffea Arabica L.) Plantations With Multispectral Sentinel-2 Msi Data","Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting factor to coffee development and productivity. Therefore, development of rapid, spatially explicit and temporal remote sensing-based approaches to determine spatial variability of coffee foliar N are imperative for increasing yields, reducing production costs and mitigating environmental impacts associated with excessive N applications. This study sought to assess the value of Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands and vegetation indices in empirical estimation of coffee foliar N content at landscape level. Results showed that coffee foliar N is related to Sentinel-2 MSI B4 (R-2 = 0.32), B6 (R-2 = 0.49), B7 (R-2 = 0.42), B8 (R-2 = 0.57) and B12 (R-2 = 0.24) bands. Vegetation indices were more related to coffee foliar N as shown by the Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index - IRECI (R-2 = 0.66), Relative Normalized Difference Index- RNDVI (R-2 = -0.48), CIREI (R-2 = 0.28), and Normalized Difference Infrared Index - NDII (R-2 = 0.37). These variables were also identified by the random forest variable optimisation as the most valuable in coffee foliar N prediction. Modelling coffee foliar N using vegetation indices produced better accuracy (R-2 = 0.71 with RMSE = 0.27 for all and R-2 = 0.73 with RMSE = 0.25 for optimized variables), compared to using spectral bands (R-2 = 0.57 with RMSE = 0.32 for all and R-2 = 0.58 with RMSE = 0.32 for optimized variables). Combining optimized bands and vegetation indices produced the best results in coffee foliar N modelling (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.23). All the three best performing models (all vegetation indices, optimized vegetation indices and combining optimal bands and optimal vegetation indices) established that 15.2 ha (4.7\%) of the total area under investigation had low foliar N levels (<2.5\%).

Moreover, converting this data into insights requires integration of non-EOS data-sets that can provide biophysical and climatic context for EOS. Digital Earth Australia has demonstrated its ability to link EOS to rainfall and stream gauge data to provide insight into surface water dynamics during the hydrological extremes of flood and drought.

The present study attempts to measure the morphometric parameters for assessing the understanding of morphological, hydrological, and physiographic properties of the south-western part of the Ganges delta. Parameters were analysed from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission's (SRTM) maps and total of eight linear, six areal, eight relief, and five drainage texture parameters have taken with hypsometric analysis for the four major rivers and two tributary river basins. The values of linear parameter denote that most of the streams (82\%) fall in first order, and other orders have homogeneous underline materials. The aerial parameters represent low peak discharge and the upper region is less vulnerable to flood. The relief parameter values show that the entire basin has low surface runoff and they are less erosional (slope < 3.97 degrees). The drainage density indicates the coarser nature and circularity ratio (0.08) represents the elongated shape. The southern portion of the basin has a greater flood potential and hypsometric index (0.49) shows the entire basin is in mature stage of formation. These results would be helpful for reckoning the watersheds for drainage management and environmental planning for ecological management and sustainable development.","{""Amin, F. M.

A false warning is a situation when the public is warned about a tornado and one does not actually occur. A missed event is a catastrophic situation where a tornado touchdown occurs without an advance warning. This paper mainly focuses on how false warnings and missed events influence the decision-making process of households and forecasters. The underlying factors for false warnings and missed events are analyzed in detail. Forecasters’ decision making about tornado warnings and the public’s decision to respond to a warning are analyzed using a probabilistic decision-tree approach. A logical basis for decision making is developed, and a fundamental inequality for decisions regarding tornado warnings is identified. This logical basis is applicable to other disasters as well. False warning and missed event probabilities are analyzed using the data from the Canadian Prairies. The overall analysis is applicable to improve the tornado-warning performance in the Canadian Prairies.\n\n","{""Durage, Samanthi""}","http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000195",2024-04-25 02:32:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2016,"{}","{""Disasters|Tornados|Canada|Decision making""}"

Remote sensing models and process based hydrological models are two kinds of effective methods for evaluating ET and its partitions.

This research used ET obtained from eddy covariance system and T obtained from sap flow observation in an apricot orchard of north China to evaluate the accuracy of ET and its components from three remote sensing models (PT-JPL, PML, and SWH) and a processbased hydrological model (SHAW). The results showed that after calibrations, all the four models satisfactorily simulated total ET particularly at annual level. Among them, the PML model had the best fit efficiency, with the most satisfied R2 and NSE values. The PT-JPL estimated average ET was the most accurate, with the slope nearest to 1.0. While for the simulation of T, SHAW model had a better performance owing to the fact that SHAW model simulate plant transpiration using changes in soil water content. The average T/ET of the models for the growing season was close to the observed value of 0.70, except that the T/ET of SWH is high due to the lack of Ei calculation. Furthermore, nearly all the three remote sensing models underestimated ET in the dry spring and overestimated ET in the rainy summer. In comparison with the process-based SHAW model, it is suggested that remote sensing ET relies more heavily on the seasonal change of meteorological factors such as precipitation but less capable in reflecting the gradually delaying process of soil moisture in the dry season. Therefore, it is indicated that for future improvement of remote sensing ET models, adjustment of soil water availability in a much longer term is suggested at least for semi-humid and semi-arid ecosystems.","{""Han, Shumin"",""Hao, Xiaohua"",""Li, Huilong"",""Li, Xiaojin"",""Yang, Yanmin"",""Yang, Yonghui"",""Zhou, Xinyao""}","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130374",2024-07-16 23:53:54,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""PT-JPL; PML; SWH; SHAW; Soil moisture""}"

6863286,"Humans Alter Habitat Selection Of Birds On Ocean-Exposed Sandy Beaches","Aim Resource-selection functions (RSFs) can quantify and predict the density of animal populations across heterogeneous landscapes and are important conservation tools in areas subject to human disturbance. Sandy beach ecosystems have comparatively low habitat heterogeneity and structural relief in the intertidal zone, but intense human use. We aimed to develop predictive RSFs for birds on ocean-exposed sandy beaches at two spatial scales, 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale), and to test whether habitat selection of birds that commonly use the surfbeachdune interface is influenced by the rates of human activities. Location Moreton and North Stradbroke Island, eastern Australia. Methods Avifauna and human activities were mapped on three sandy beaches covering 79 km of coastline for 15 months. Habitat characteristics of the surfbeach-dune interface were derived from remote sensing and ground surveys. RSFs were developed for 12 species of birds at two spatial scales: 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale). Results At local (25 ha) and landscape scales (250 ha), dune dimensions and the extent and type of vegetation structure were important predictors of bird density. Adding the frequency of human activities improved the predictive power of RSFs, suggesting that habitat selection of birds on beaches is modified by human use of these environments. Human activities occurred mostly in the mid-to lower intertidal zone of the beach, overlapping closely with the preferred habitats of Silver Gulls (Larus novaehollandiae), Pied Oystercatchers (Haematopus longirostris), Red-capped Plovers (Charadrius ruficapillus) and endangered Little Terns (Sternula albifrons). Main conclusions In addition to demonstrating the appropriateness of RSFs to the surf-beach-dune interface, our results stress the need for systematic conservation planning for these ecosystems, where ecological values have traditionally been subsidiary to the maintenance of sand budgets and erosion control.","{""Meager, Justin J."",""Nielsen, Tara"",""Schlacher, Thomas A.""}","10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00873.x",2024-07-19 21:11:27,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2012,"{}","{""Conservation; habitat selection; human impacts; shorebirds; spatial scale""}"
6863090,"Economic Evaluations Of Remote Patient Monitoring For Chronic Disease: A Systematic Review","Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review and summarize economic evaluations of noninvasive remote patient monitoring (RPM) for chronic diseases compared with usual care. Methods: A systematic literature search identified economic evaluations of RPM for chronic diseases, compared with usual care. Searches of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and EconLit using keyword synonyms for RPM and economics identified articles published from up until September 2021. Title, abstract, and full-text reviews were conducted. Data extraction of study characteristics and health economic findings was performed. Article reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. Results: This review demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of RPM was dependent on clinical context, capital investment, organizational processes, and willingness to pay in each specific setting. RPM was found to be highly cost-effective for hypertension and may be cost-effective for heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There were few studies that investigated RPM for diabetes or other chronic diseases. Studies were of high reporting quality, with an average Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards score of 81%. Of the final 34 included studies, most were conducted from the healthcare system perspective. Eighteen studies used cost-utility analysis, 4 used cost-effectiveness analysis, 2 combined cost-utility analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis, 1 used cost-consequence analysis, 1 used cost-benefit analysis, and 8 used cost-minimization analysis. Conclusions: RPM was highly cost-effective for hypertension and may achieve greater long-term cost savings from the prevention of high-cost health events. For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, cost-effectiveness findings differed according to disease severity and there was limited economic evidence for diabetes interventions. © 2021 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc.","{""Caffery, L.

6863653,"Changes In Rice Cultivation Affect Population Trends Of Herons And Egrets In Italy","The breeding populations of colonial herons, egrets and allied waterbirds in Northwestern Italy increased since 1972, when a long-term monitoring was initiated, up to the end of the 20 degrees century. Populations of continental importance for some heron species were concentrated mostly in the district of intensive rice cultivation, where the paddies offered wide foraging opportunities. After 2000, new cultivation techniques caused a progressive reduction in paddy flooding. We found a significant relationship between the post-2000 decrease in the number of nests of the three most abundant species of waterbirds, Grey Heron, Little Egret and Black-crowned Nightheron, and the diminishing extent of paddy flooding estimated on satellite-derived images. On the other hand, outside the paddies district the same three species continued to increase or remained mostly stable. The recent agronomic changes in the paddies of Northwestern Italy compromise their role as surrogates of natural wetlands and their importance for environmental conservation. The spread of dry rice fields, and the consequent loss of their value for conservation of aquatic biodiversity, call for a revision of the regulations and incentives to farmers under the Common Agriculture Policy by the European Union and by local authorities. Return to early-submerged rice fields and adoption of environmental-friendly practices, such as the creation of compensatory wetlands, should become mandatory for rice to maintain its status as ""green"" crop.","{""Boncompagni, Eleonora"",""Cardarelli, Elisa"",""Delle Monache, Daniele"",""Fasola, Mauro"",""Morganti, Michelangelo"",""Pellitteri-Rosa, Daniele"",""Ranghetti, Luigi""}","10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02135",2024-07-17 18:42:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Grey Heron; Little Egret; Black-crowned Night-heron; Population; Rice; Conservation""}"
6863532,"Land Use Classification From Social Media Data And Satellite Imagery","Detailed urban land use classification plays a highly important role in the development and management of cities and in the identification of human activities. The complexity of the urban system makes its functional zoning a challenge, which makes such maps underutilized. A detailed land use classification encompasses both the natural land features and the classification of structures closely related to human activities. The use of satellite imagery to classify land use can effectively benefit the recognition of natural objects, but its performance demands significant improvement in the recognition of social functions due to the lack of information regarding human activities. To identify such activities in an urban area, we added Point of Interests (POI) data. This dataset contains both geographical tags and attributes that describe human activities. However, it has an uneven spatial distribution, with gaps in coverage being readily apparent. This paper proposes a land use classification framework using satellite imagery and data from social media. The proposed method employs a kernel density estimation to handle the spatial unevenness of POI data. The solution of mixed programming of MPI and OpenMP was adopted to parallel the algorithm. The results are compared to data compiled manually by means of human interpretation. Considering the example of Wuhan city, results show that the overall accuracy of land use type classification is 86.2\%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.860. It is demonstrated that using both POI and satellite images, a detailed land use map can be created automatically with satisfactory robustness.","{""An, Ying"",""Chen, Bo"",""Wang, JunJue"",""Ye, Yaqin"",""Zhong, Yingqiang""}","10.1007/s11227-019-02922-6",2024-07-17 19:36:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{calibration}","{""Land use; Point of Interests; Satellite image; Classification""}"
6863423,"Retrieving Crop Albedo Based On Radar Sentinel-1 And Random Forest Approach","Monitoring agricultural crops is of paramount importance for preserving water resources and increasing water efficiency over semi-arid areas. This can be achieved by modelling the water resources all along the growing season through the coupled water–surface energy balance. Surface albedo is a key land surface variable to constrain the surface radiation budget and hence the coupled water–surface energy balance. In order to capture the hydric status changes over the growing season, optical remote sensing becomes impractical due to cloud cover in some periods, especially over irrigated winter crops in semi-arid regions. To fill the gap, this paper aims to generate cloudless surface albedo product from Sentinel-1 data that offers a source of high spatio-temporal resolution images. This can help to better capture the vegetation development along the growth season through the surface radiation budget. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was implemented using Sentinel-1 backscatters as input. The approach was tested over an irrigated semi-arid zone in Morocco, which is known by its heterogeneity in term of soil conditions and crop types. The obtained results are evaluated against Landsat-derived albedo with quasi-concurrent Landsat/Sentinel-1 overpasses (up to one day offset), while a further validation was investigated using in situ field scale albedo data. The best model-hyperparameters selection was dependent on two validation approaches (K-fold cross-validation ‘k = 10’, and holdout). The more robust and accurate model parameters are those that represent the best statistical metrics (root mean square error ‘RMSE’, bias and correlation coefficient ‘R’). Coefficient values ranging from 0.70 to 0.79 and a RMSE value between 0.0002 and 0.00048 were obtained comparing Landsat and predicted albedo by RF method. The relative error ratio equals 4.5, which is acceptable to predict surface albedo. © 2021 by the authors.","{""Amazirh, A."",""Bouras, E. H."",""Chehbouni, A."",""Er-Raki, S."",""Olivera-Guerra, L.

6863574,"Gis-Based Sustainable City Compactness Assessment Using Integration Of Mcdm, Bayes Theorem And Radar Technology","In recent decades, compact urban development and smart cities are recognised as most sustainable urban form in an effort to protect natural environment. Therefore, evaluation of existing compactness and sustainability of an area is an essential task before the real development takes place. In the literature, it is possible to see some studies on city's compactness assessment and most of them have considered only a few aspects of compact development analysis. This paper aims to analyse urban sustainability of Kajang city (Malaysia) through a comprehensive city compactness assessment using geographical information system and radar remote sensing technology. To measure building density, a RADAR image of the study area was used to extract built-up areas with the aid of pixel-based and object-based classification schemes. Mixed land use development, urban density and intensity were the main indicators of the analysis. Finally, multicriteria decision-making and Bayes theorems were applied for overall compactness assessment. Building density analysis was validated using standard confusion matrix, which showed more than 90\% accuracy. Similarly, the root-mean squared error showed 0.35 for object-based classification. The results classified the zones of the Kajang city in the range of least to most compact zones with the compactness value of 0.00273-0.0146, respectively. The results obtained in this study can help local government to improve the compactness of least compact zones to make Kajang city more sustainable. Furthermore, the results revealed that efficient public transportation and proper community facilities are the key factors to achieve sustainable urban development.","{""Abdullahi, Saleh"",""Jebur, Mustafa Neamah"",""Pradhan, Biswajeet""}","10.1080/10106049.2014.911967",2024-09-30 17:25:35,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}","{""Bayes theorem; remote sensing; GIS; compact city assessment; sustainable urban development; SAR""}"
6862877,"Applications And Challenges Of Artificial Intelligence In Space Missions","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding acceptance in the space community, especially Machine Learning (ML), a subdomain of AI. ML algorithms now find numerous applications in autonomous navigation, spacecraft health monitoring and operational management of satellite constellations. However, a large number of surveys on the applications of AI in space missions can be classified into two categories. The first category suffers from the limitation of being old and not covering some crucial and recent developments in the field; such as the contributions of Deep Learning (DL) and bioinspired AI algorithms. The challenge with the second category lies in its being too detailed with respect to the development and application of specific AI techniques or algorithms. These limitations have necessitated the need to have a concise survey with a wider scope for those interested in the applications and challenges of AI in the space industry, especially those with technical backgrounds in other fields. In this paper, we surveyed the use of traditional AI techniques in various domains of space missions without delving into formal methods. Some bioinspired AI algorithms were also surveyed and their potential application areas highlighted. Unlike similar surveys that focus only on technological challenges, we also addressed some crucial legal drawbacks that emanate from the reliance and use of AI in space. Summarily, while discussing future directions we reviewed some advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies. Our review prioritized three application domains positioned to benefit immensely from the inevitable AI-Blockchain convergence in the space community.

6863010,"Spectral Diversity Metrics For Detecting Oil Pollution Effect On Biodiversity In The Niger Delta","Biodiversity monitoring in the Niger delta has become pertinent in view of the incessant spillages from oil production activities and the socio-economic impact of these spillages on the inhabitants who depend on the resources for their livelihood. Conventional methods of post-impact assessments are expensive, time consuming, and cause damage to the environment, as they often require the removal of affected samples/specimens for laboratory analysis. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space while using the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). The SVH proposes that the species diversity of a sampled area is linearly correlated with the variability of spectral reflectance of the area. Several authors have tested the SVH on various land cover types and spatial scales; however, the present study evaluated the validity of the SVH against the backdrop of oil pollution impact on biodiversity while using vascular plant species as surrogates. Species richness and diversity indices were computed from vegetation data collected from polluted and non-polluted transects. Spectral metrics that were derived from Sentinel 2 bands and broadband vegetation indices (BVIs) using various algorithms, including averages, spread, dimension reduction, and so on, were assessed for their ability to estimate vascular plants species richness and diversity. The results showed significant differences in vegetation characteristics of polluted and control transects (H = 76.05, p-value = < 0.05 for abundance and H = 170.03, p-value < 0.05 for richness). Spectral diversity metrics correlated negatively with species data on polluted transects and positively on control transects. The metrics computed using Sentinel 2A bands and vegetation indices proved to be sensitive to changes in vegetation characteristics following oil pollution. The most robust relationship was observed between the metrics and indices on control transects, whereas the weakest relationships were observed on polluted transects. Index-wise, the Simpson's diversity index regressed better with spectral metrics (R2 > 0.5), whereas the Chao-1 richness index regressed the least (R2 < 0.5). The strength of the relationship resulted in successfully estimating species richness and diversity values of investigated transects, thereby enhancing biodiversity monitoring over time and space. © 2019 by the authors.","{""Balzter, H."",""Berrio, J.

6862867,"Estimating Impacts Of Plantation Forestry On Plant Biodiversity In Southern Chile-A Spatially Explicit Modelling Approach","Monitoring the impacts of land-use practices is of particular importance with regard to biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km(2)) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity.

6903601,"A Network To Understand The Changing Socio-Ecology Of The Southern African Woodlands (Seosaw): Challenges, Benefits, And Methods","Societal Impact Statement The sustainable management of the southern African woodlands is closely linked to the livelihoods of over 150 M people. Findings from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands (SEOSAW) will underpin the sustainability of two of the largest industries on the continent: woodfuels and timber. SEOSAW will also improve our understanding of how human use shapes the biogeography and functioning of these ecosystems. Summary Here we describe a new network of researchers and long-term, in situ, measurements that will characterize the changing socio-ecology of the woodlands of southern Africa. These woodlands encompass the largest savanna in the world, but are chronically understudied, with few long-term measurements. A network of permanent sample plots (PSPs) is required to: (a) address management issues, particularly related to sustainable harvesting for energy and timber; (b) understand how the woodlands are responding to a range of global and local drivers, such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, and harvesting; and (c) answer basic questions about biogeography, ecosystem function, and the role humans play in shaping the ecology of the region. We draw on other successful networks of PSPs and adapt their methods to the specific challenges of working in southern African woodlands. In particular we suggest divergences from established forest monitoring protocols that are needed to (a) adapt to a high level of ecosystem structural diversity (from open savanna to dry forest); (b) quantify the chronic disturbances by people, fire, and herbivores; (c) quantify the diversity and function of the understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs; (d) understand the life histories of resprouting trees; and (e) conduct work in highly utilized, human-dominated landscapes. We conclude by discussing how the SEOSAW network will integrate with remote sensing and modeling approaches. Throughout, we highlight the challenges inherent to integrating work by forest and savanna ecologists, and the wide range of skills needed to fully understand the socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands.",NA,"10.1002/ppp3.10168",2024-09-30 21:40:07,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862930,"Land Use And Land Cover Change Dynamics And Perceived Drivers In Rangeland Areas In Central Uganda","Sustainable rangeland management requires understanding the nature of human-ecosystem interactions and local communities' perspectives regarding evolving changes. This study integrated perceptions from the local community and remote sensing to characterize the extent and drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the rangelands of Nakasongola district in Central Uganda. The aim of the study was to determine the perceived drivers of land use and land cover change in of Nakasongola district in the Central Uganda district to support decision making for present and future rangeland management. Satellite imagery for 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015 and 2021 were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and analyzed to determine the LULC dynamics. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to obtain perceived drivers of LULC. Results showed that by 1985 grassland covered 31.7\%, wetlands 26.4\%, woodland 11.5\% and farmland 7.2\% of the total land area. However, by 2021, farmland covered 35.8\% of the total land area, wetland 21.6\% and had reduced to grassland 18.5 percent. Future LULC projections using a Markov chain model showed that farmland cover will increase by 13.85\% while grassland cover will further decline by 9.89\% in 2040. Wood fuel extraction, subsistence farming, population growth and overgrazing were perceived as key drivers of LULC change. Both remote sensing techniques and local perceptions were in agreement with the identification of patterns and perceived drivers revealing the inherent value of tacit knowledge resident within the community. This knowledge in addition to remotely sensed information can thus be tapped by the decision leaders to better guide interventions aimed at securing better rangeland health and management.","{""Egeru, Anthony"",""Kuule, Derick Ansyijar"",""Magaya, Paul John"",""Mwesigwa, Gordon Yofesi"",""Nyombi, Kenneth"",""Okurut, Isaac Tom"",""Ssentongo, Benard"",""Tabuti, John Robert Stephen""}","10.3390/land11091402",2024-07-17 18:02:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""rangelands; extent; local perceptions; future""}"

Remote sensing is a valuable data source to investigate different phases of fire management. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been designed to include specific characteristics for fire detection. It provides global coverage every 1 to 2 days. MODIS for forest fire monitoring has high detection accuracy, high radiometric resolution, moderate spatial resolution modes, and a high saturation level. Fires occur repeatedly in Iranian forests during the summer time. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports, 0.06\% of Iran's forests burn every year. Fire season in the northern part of Iran is from May until the end of October. The results show that 86.21\% of the fires detected by MODIS from 2001 to 2008 occurred in cropland, grass land and plain regions. Most of these fires occurred in the eastern regions of the Mazandaran Sea. A correlation of 0.76 exists between the fire frequency and the rainfall. Areas with precipitation lower than 1000 mm experienced 86.01\% of the fires. Most of the fires occurred at elevations below 500 m from mean sea level (MSL).

Based on the remote sensing image of 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2017 as the data source combined with field survey to verify the images, we used the ArcGIS and landscape pattern index method to construct landscape ecological security index to analyze the evolution of landscape pattern and the spatio-temporal differentiation laws of ecological security in the trough valley area. Therefore, an environment-friendly land use combination model is proposed. The results were as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2017, the overall landscape pattern of trough valley area presented fragmentation, the number of landscape patches increased, the landscape pattern changed from single regularization and simplification to complex and mixed type, the diversity increased and the spatial heterogeneity enhanced. With the variation of time, the overall landscape ecological security in karst trough valley showed an upward trend,the Ecological Security Index (ESI) of the western and eastern trough valleys increased from the trough basin to the two sides of the hillside, while the middle trough valley increased from the hillside to the trough basin. (2) At a research scale of 200 m,the global positive correlation of ESI in the western trough valleys is the most significant, and its Moran's I value showed a trend of first increased and then decreased,but the middle and eastern troughs were the opposite.The spatial agglomeration pattern of ESI in karst trough valley area was mainly manifested as high-high and low-low value agglomeration areas, and the spatial agglomeration degree was higher, while the distribution of high-low and low-high agglomeration areas was less and its change was not obvious.(3) The landscape agglomeration distribution pattern is influenced by low topographic relief and low slope that presents similar trend of inverted ""U"" shape, while the elevation is opposite. (4) The landscape pattern of karst trough valley area can increase the landscape ecological security by expanding the land use combination pattern of “woodland-shrub woodland-grassland”. (5) The spatio-temporal differentiation of landscape pattern and its ecological security is the result of the joint action of the local natural environment, social economy and policies. We can provide scientific reference for regional scientific decision-making by analyzing the driving mechanism of multiple factors on landscape pattern and ecological security evolution trend of trough valley area. © 2021 Science Press.

6863579,"Massachusetts Roadmap To Net Zero: Accounting For Ownership Of Soil Carbon Regulating Ecosystem Services And Land Conversions","The state of Massachusetts (MA) has passed comprehensive climate change legislation and a roadmap of achieving Net Zero emissions in 2050, which includes the protection of environmental resources (e.g., soil) and green space across the state. Soil resources are an integral part of the land cover/land use. They can be a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of the conversion of ""low disturbance"" land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to ""high disturbance"" land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and high-intensity developed land). These often ""invisible"" GHG emissions can be considered as ""negative externalities"" and ""external costs"" because of the difficulty in assigning ownership to the emissions. The combination of remote sensing and soil information data analysis can identify the ownership associated with GHG emissions and therefore expand the range of policy tools for addressing these emissions. This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for MA by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. The results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions, which can be linked to ownership. The state of MA can use these remote sensing tools and publicly available data to quantify and value GHG emissions based on property ownership, therefore ""internalizing"" the costs of these emissions for a cost-effective climate mitigation policy.","{""Hao, Zhenbang"",""Lin, Lili"",""Mikhailova, Elena A."",""Post, Christopher J."",""Post, Gregory C."",""Schlautman, Mark A."",""Zurqani, Hamdi A.""}","10.3390/laws11020027",2024-07-17 18:10:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{maybe}","{""CO2; climate change; emissions; law; policy; property; social costs; urbanization""}"
6863077,"Study On Monitoring Spad Values For Multispatial Spatial Vertical Scales Of Summer Maize Based On Uav Multispectral Remote Sensing","Rapid acquisition of chlorophyll content in maize leaves is of great significance for timely monitoring of maize plant health and guiding field management. In order to accurately detect the relative chlorophyll content of summer maize and study the responsiveness of vegetation indices to SPAD (soil and plant analyzer development) values of summer maize at different spatial vertical scales, this paper established a prediction model for SPAD values of summer maize leaves at different spatial scales based on UAV multispectral images. The experiment collected multispectral image data from summer maize at the jointing stage and selected eight vegetation indices. By using the sparrow search optimized kernel limit learning machine (SSA-KELM), the prediction models for canopy leaf (CL) SPAD(CL) and ear leaf (EL) SPAD(EL) were established, and a linear fitting analysis was conducted combining the measured SPAD(CL) values and SPAD(EL) values on the ground. The results showed that for SPAD(CL), the R-2 of the linear fitting between the predicted values and measured values was 0.899, and the RMSE was 1.068. For SPAD(EL), the R-2 of linear fitting between the predicted values and the measured values was 0.837, and the RMSE was 0.89. Compared with the model established by the partial least squares method (PLSR), it is found that the sparrow search optimized kernel limit learning machine (SSA-KELM) has more precise prediction results with better stability and adaptability for small sample prediction. The research results can provide technical support for remote sensing monitoring of the chlorophyll content of summer maize at different spatial scales.","{""Cui, Hongwei"",""Ji, Jiangtao"",""Li, Nana"",""Li, Yuchao"",""Ma, Hao"",""Zhang, Haolei"",""Zhao, Xinbo""}","10.3390/agriculture13051004",2024-07-19 20:18:27,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""multispectral remote sensing; vegetation index; SPAD values; SSA-KELM; PLSR""}"
6862866,"Introducing A Map Of Soil Base Cation Concentration, An Ecologically Relevant Gis-Layer For Amazonian Forests","Soil maps are crucial for habitat and species distribution modeling under present and future conditions, thereby providing relevant background information for conservation planning. In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and proba-bility of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable. It is available as a digital GIS layer and can be used in habitat mapping and in modeling the current or future distributions of biological communities and species. This will advance general understanding of Amazonian biogeography and help in conservation planning.","{""Chaves, P. P."",""Quesada, C.

6447826,"Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES): A framework for monitoring environmental changes from Earth Observations","Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale. This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.","{""Alexandris, Nikos"",""Allenbach, Karin"",""Chatenoux, Bruno"",""Dao, Hy"",""De Bono, Andrea"",""De Laborie, Pierric"",""Giuliani, Gregory"",""Peduzzi, Pascal"",""Rodila, Denisa""}","10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.040",NA,NA,NA,2017,"{}","{""Big Data"",""Earth Observations"",""Environmental changes"",Interoperability,Monitoring,""Sustainable development""}"
6863177,"Real-Time River Monitoring Supports Community Management Of Low-Flow Periods","Increasing pressure on river catchment water resources has heightened the need for real-time monitoring data for water management agencies and users. This study investigates the capability to develop a technical basis for water co-management at the catchment scale. A web application (dashboard) was created that displayed real-time data for weather, soil water, river flow and water quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions, including streamflow and rainfall forecasts. A method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data. The dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment, through the Ringarooma Water Users Group (RWUG) in NE Tasmania, Australia. The dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services, and accessed by RWUG members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied. Irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability, and water extractions and releases, and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub-groups. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) collaborated with the RWUG in this adaptive management approach, as enabled by the Ringarooma River Catchment Water Management Plan, and later informed a new Ministerial Policy for ‘Water Resource Management During Extreme Dry Conditions’. Group management was assisted by using alerts sent through the existing DPIPWE text messaging service. Results showed that stakeholder understanding of technical information and scenario implications using the sensor-based dashboard increased capacity of irrigators to make decisions that improve production and social outcomes, while considering environmental values. This study demonstrates that the information provided through the dashboard enabled a high level of community and inter-agency co-operation, demonstrating potential to apply this management approach in other catchments. © 2019","{""Almeida, A."",""Bai, Q."",""Ellison, J.

6862717,"Prioritization Of Subwatershed Through Morphometric Analysis Of Amaravathi Watershed Using Geoinformatic Techniques","Prioritization of subwatersheds in a river basin using morphometric parameters is one of the elegant approaches for the development of watersheds and its management. The concept of prioritization plays a key role in identifying areas which require immediate intervention for natural resources conservation plans in the subwatershed level. In this study, an attempt has been made to prioritize subwatershed based on morphometric parameters using remote-sensing and GIS techniques to understand the role of channel network on the geo-hydrological behavior of Amaravathi watershed. This study also describes geology, geomorphology, and soil characteristics of the watershed. The ASTER DEM data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were utilized to prepare thematic maps such as drainage, stream order, watershed, and drainage density map. The drainage morphometric analysis was performed through linear, aerial, and relief aspects. The predominantly dendritic drainage pattern is noticed and Amaravathi watershed, which has been divided into 31 subwatersheds. Prioritization of subwatershed was carried out based on compound parameter analysis by adding the values of linear and shape parameters of each subwatershed. In this study, it is observed that out of 31 subwatersheds, 10 fall in high priority (SWS-1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 21, 23), 10 fall in medium priority (SWS-2, 3, 12, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31), and the remaining 11 fall in low priority (SWS-7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 24, 26, 28, 30). Hence, the high priority subwatersheds are possible for soil erosion. In connection to that, we suggest that the high-priority subwatersheds should take precaution methods to avoid the future hazard. © The Author(s), 2022.

6903525,"Tree-Related Microhabitats Are Promising Yet Underused Tools For Biodiversity And Nature Conservation: A Systematic Review For International Perspectives","Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators. Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them, and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101 articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3\%) were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3\%) of the articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and unmanaged forests played a key role as a ""natural "" forest reference for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing, climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.",NA,"10.3389/ffgc.2022.818474",2024-09-27 23:03:16,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863442,"Procedures Of Soil Farming Allowing Reduction Of Compaction","Evaluation of new technologies using guidance systems is very important and can help producers with choosing the right equipment for their applications. Without using satellite navigation during field operations, there is a tendency for passes to overlap. That results in waste of fuel and pesticides, longer working times and also environmental damage. When utilising satellite guidance for field operations, there is a close connection with controlled traffic farming (CTF) as well. CTF is currently a quite quickly developing farming system based on fixed layout of machinery passes across a field. Tracks precisely set out for a machine's tyres in the field could be a tool for minimising soil compaction risk which is another threat to the environment. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy of currently available guidance systems for agricultural machines. Real pass-to-pass errors (omissions and overlaps) in a field were measured. Consequently, comparison between observed guidance systems was made regarding final working accuracy. Further, intensity of machinery passes, percentage of wheeled area and repeated passes in fields were monitored. These measurements were made in fields under real operating conditions using a conventional tillage system with ploughing and also a conservation tillage system, both systems with randomly organized traffic. Finally, the same parameters were monitored in fields where fixed machinery tracks were used for all operations and passes but only under a conservation tillage system. Pass-to-pass accuracy was measured for the evaluation of different guidance systems. Size of missed areas or overlaps was evaluated statistically. Concerning intensity of machinery passes and total field area affected by machinery passes, the following facts were found out. The experiments with randomized traffic showed a significant difference of the parameters mentioned above between a conventional tillage system with ploughing and a conservation tillage system. Wheeled area was 86 and 64\%, respectively which proves benefits of conservation tillage. The experiments with a fixed track system showed that the total run-over area by machinery tyres decreased even more (up to 31\%) in comparison to randomized traffic in a field (only fields under conservation tillage system were monitored and evaluated). The following statements based on our results can be made. The navigation and therefore possibility for better accuracy of machinery passes in fields together with permanent machinery tracks utilization could help with soil condition improvement and also energy savings which would result from that. The CTF system will help with further development of a system for soil compaction protection which is currently a real necessity.","{""Hula, J."",""Kroulik, M."",""Kumhala, F."",""Kviz, Z."",""Loch, T.""}","10.1007/s11119-010-9206-1",2024-07-18 22:00:49,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2011,"{""navigation of tractors""}","{""Guidance systems; Machinery passes; Controlled traffic farming (CTF); Global positioning system (GPS""}"

An algorithm is introduced here that includes lifecycle costs, avoided losses, users’ willingness to pay and value per statistical life (VSL), and both environmental and health impacts. The algorithm is entitled the Socio-Technical-Environmental Project Selection (STEPS) algorithm and incorporates social and health aspects through the willingness to pay, technical aspects through the engineering design, and economic aspects through the lifecycle costs. The algorithm consists of estimating the various quantities needed, such as lifecycle costs, benefits (avoided mortality and infrastructure losses), willingness to pay, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level (EPA-MCL). These values are plotted with the environmental and health impacts on the horizontal axis and the Net Cost (equal to the lifecycle cost minus the benefits) on the vertical axis. The most balanced option is the one that plots closest to the origin of the plot. The new algorithm is demonstrated on project selection for the elimination of riverbank erosion using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as riprap. RCA uses previously used crushed concrete from demolition as aggregate for any beneficial purpose such as aggregate for new concrete or riprap, as in this case. The disadvantage of RCA, however, is that harmful chemicals leach out when exposed to water. Four options were considered, namely (1) do nothing, (2) use RCA as a riverbank erosion countermeasure, (3) use RCA with a leachate treatment system, and (4) use rock riprap instead of RCA. It was found that the proposed STEPS algorithm leads to the selection of Option 3 with RCA riprap and leachate treatment. Selecting by cost alone would have led to Option 2, which also happens to result in a violation of the EPA-MCL for the arsenic leachate. In addition, Option 4 would have been selected without considering RCA or the problem with landfills reaching capacity with the addition of crushed concrete.

We used satellite imagery to determine the location of habitats within its locality. We further used infrared imagery to identify warmer and cooler habitats within the area. Details of its occurence were mapped, based on observational data acquired throughout the flight season. From this, we were able to establish that its population moves around its locality, and we also establish its environmental requirements for conservation. We also indicate its umbrella value for representing two other threatened odonate species, Endangered Proischnura polychromatica and Vulnerable Syncordulia legator, as well as some other CFR endemic odonates.

6863249,"Linking Landscape Pattern, Ecosystem Service Value, And Human Well-Being In Xishuangbanna, Southwest China: Insights From A Coupling Coordination Model","Landscape pattern, ecosystem service value (ESV), and human well-being are closely related. Determining the link between the three is significant to the realization of regional sustainable development. However, the relationship is complex and vulnerable to multiple factors, many of which remain unknown. This study used remote sensing imagery of Xishuangbanna to map land-use in 1996, 2003, 2010, and 2016 and used landscape metrics to quantify landscape pattern changes. This research evaluated changes to ESV using the benefit transfer method and evaluated changes in human well-being using the evaluation index system and the entropy weight method. A coupling coordination model was used to analyze the coupling coordination state of the three, and the grey correlation method was used to determine key factors involved in the coupling mechanism. The results show that: (1) Forest, rubber, and tea are the main land-use types, with the area of forest decreasing, the area of rubber presenting an inverted V-shape change trend, the area of tea presenting an N-shape change trend, and the transformation of a large quantity of forest land into rubber and tea plantations. (2) The landscape pattern has become more fragmented, and connectivity and stability are in decline. (3) Climate regulation, water regulation, and erosion prevention are the main ecosystem services and, from 1996 to 2016, total ESV decreased by 3.53 billion yuan, mainly due to the decrease in forest ESV. Meanwhile, across the region, the area of high value decreased, and the area of median value increased, with a distribution trend of high value in the north and low value in the south. (4) The level of human well-being continues to rise. (5) The link between landscape pattern, ESV, and human well-being was relatively strong, and the coupling coordination degree first increased and then decreased, changing from grudging coordination to primary coordination and then dropping to a state of near maladjustment. Patch density and food production are the key coupling effect factors of landscape pattern and ESV on human well-being, respectively.

6863094,"Data Assimilation For Leaf Area Index Of Tobacco On The Basis Of The Ensemble Kalman Filter In Nanxiong","Leaf area index (LAI) can be used as a monitoring index for assessing tobacco health in different growing periods. Hence, acquiring and updating accurate LAI data in a timely manner are necessary for managing the growth of tobacco. Growth information for tobacco in different seasons could provide valuable information for management on a national scale. Accurate and continuous tobacco LAI dynamics data are based on the data fusion framework of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which is an efficient recursive filter to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noise measurements, can be used to obtain optimal results. Nanxiong City in Guangdong Province was selected as the study area to extract LAI data for tobacco and test the effect of EnKF method on the basis of quantitative remote sensing data for the growing state of tobacco in 2014. Tobacco canopy hyperspectral reflectance data in different growing seasons were collected every 15 days by using AvaSpec-ULS2048 HandHeld spectroradiometer made by Avantes company in the Netherlands. Tobacco LAI data were retrieved using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which was calculated using the reflectance data. An improved tobacco growth model (LOGISTIC) was established using the LAI data collected around Nanxiong. This improved model used LAI and accumulated temperature to reveal the changes in LAI in different growing seasons. On the basis of integration of LAI data (obtained using remote sensing data) and LAI data (obtained using the simplified LOGISTIC model and EnKF method), continuous LAI data were obtained in the time series during the tobacco growing season in Nanxiong. Finally, we compared three different LAI computing methods in tobacco study: (a) calculated by NDVI, (b) simulated by the LOGISTIC model and (c) data assimilation was based on EnKF. The results indicated that these three methods could describe the growth status of tobacco to a certain extent, especially in the mature growth period, however, the LAI assimilation method was the best, which was able to adjust measured values and model values dynamically, LAI data were more consistent with the practical growth conditions of tobacco. Method (a) was imperfect at early and late growth seasons of tobacco (in these two seasons, the LAI data were either less or more), and method (b) was more dependent on accumulated temperature data (LOGISTIC model could not effectively describe the unexpected changes in tobacco LAI). The results showed that the EnKF algorithm could obtain better estimation on the basis of the dynamic model, and assimilate remote sensing data into the dynamic model to obtain optimal estimation for LAI. The assimilated LAI data were closer to the real values, and the LAI curve was more consistent with actual tobacco growth status. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

6863676,"Technological Advances In Drifters For Oil Transport Studies","Advances in drifter technology applied to oil spill studies from 1970 to the present are summarized here. Initially, drifters designed for oil spill response were intended to remotely track trajectories of accidental spills and help guide responders. Most recently, inexpensive biodegradable drifters were developed for massive deployments, making it possible to significantly improve numerical transport models and to investigate, via observations, the processes leading to dispersion and accumulation of surface pollutants across multiple scales. Over the past 50 years, drifters have benefited from constant improvements in electronics for accurate and frequent location and data transmission, as well as progress in material sciences to reduce fabrication costs and minimize the environmental impact of sacrificial instruments. The large amount of in-situ data provided by drifters, covering a broad area, is crucial to validate the numerical models and remote sensing products that are becoming more important in guiding response and policy decisions.","{""Guigand, Cedric M."",""Novelli, Guillaume"",""Ozgokmen, Tamay M.""}","10.4031/mtsj.52.6.9",2024-09-30 17:15:50,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""oil spill; drifter; ocean's surface; dispersion; transport""}"
6863128,"Deep Low-Rank And Sparse Patch-Image Network For Infrared Dim And Small Target Detection","Detection of infrared dim and small targets with diverse and cluttered background plays a significant role in many applications. In this article, we propose a deep low-rank and sparse patch-image network, termed as Deep-LSP-Net, to effectively detect small targets in a single infrared image. Specifically, by using the local patch construction scheme, we first transform the original infrared image into a patch image, which can be decomposed as a superposition of the low-rank background component and the sparse target component. The target detection is thus formulated as an optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularizations, which can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). We unroll the iterative algorithm into deep neural networks, where a generalized sparsifying transform and a singular value thresholding (SVT) operator are learned by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to avoid tedious parameter tuning and improve the interpretability of the neural networks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two public datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain improved performance in small infrared target detection compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","{""Hu, Y."",""Li, P."",""Lu, X."",""Zhang, Y."",""Zhou, X.""}","10.1109/tgrs.2023.3288574",2024-09-30 21:33:52,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2023,"{}","{""Cluttered backgrounds"",""Construction scheme"",""Deep learning"",""Deep learning (DL)"",""Deep neural networks"",""Dim target"",""Dim target detection"",""Infrared image"",""Infrared imaging"",""Iterative methods"",""Model-based OPC"",""Small target detection"",""Small targets"",""artificial neural network"",""detection method"",dim,""infrared images"",""machine learning"",""model-based network"",""numerical model"",optimization,""satellite imagery"",""small target detection""}"
6863660,"Spatiotemporal Variation Of Ndvi In Anhui Province From 2001 To 2019 And Its Response To Climatic Factors","This paper intends to clarify that the spatial and temporal evolutionary patterns of regional vegetation and their relationship with climate form a premise of ecological conservation and environmental governance, and play an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem balance and promoting sustainable development. Based on measured data collected from NDVI remote sensing products and meteorological stations, NDVI variation in Anhui Province from 2001 to 2019 was determined through trend analysis and measurement methods involving coefficient of variation and Hurst index; in addition, the response to climatic factors was also explored. It was concluded that, firstly, in terms of spatiotemporal analysis, the interannual variation of NDVI in Anhui Province showed an increasing trend with a rate of 0.024/10 a, while the monthly variation showed a weak bimodal pattern, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Furthermore, NDVI in Anhui Province showed significant spatial heterogeneity, with high values concentrated in mountainous regions in southern Anhui and Dabie Mountain region, and low values concentrated in the hilly areas of Jianghuai and areas along the Yangtze River. At the same time, the overall spatial variation of NDVI showed an increasing trend, and the areas with extremely significant and significant improvement in vegetation coverage accounted for 54.69\% of the total area of Anhui Province. Secondly, in terms of the analysis on variation characteristics, the variation of NDVI in Anhui Province was generally stable, with an average CV coefficient of variation of 0.089, which, however, was quite different in different regions; meanwhile, the future trend of NDVI variation in the study areas was mostly in a random manner. Thirdly, the response of NDVI in Anhui Province to climatic factors showed significant spatial heterogeneity. NDVI was found to be positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature; in general, the impact of precipitation on NDVI was greater than that of temperature. In the 19 years studied, NDVI in Anhui Province showed an increasing trend; and climate, topography and human activities led to heterogeneous spatial distribution of vegetation. Therefore, in the future, the evolutionary trend of vegetation will be relatively random, and NDVI will be more greatly affected by temperature, than by precipitation.","{""Chang, Zhu"",""Chen, Donghua"",""Chen, Jian"",""Han, Weijie"",""Li, Hu"",""Liu, Saisai"",""Wang, Zuo"",""Ye, Lizao""}","10.3390/f13101643",2024-07-18 22:42:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""NDVI; trend analysis; coefficient of variation; Hurst index; climatic response""}"
6863095,"A Qualitative Study Of Health-Care Personnel's Experience Of A Satellite Pharmacy At A Hiv Clinic","Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate how health-care personnel at a HIV clinic perceived conventional pharmacies in Sweden and whether the decentralization of pharmaceutical services to the HIV clinic had led to an improved collaboration between other health-care professionals and pharmacists. Methods: Doctors and nurses who had regular contacts with HIV patients and the satellite pharmacy were interviewed. The interviews were semi-structured, using open questions and was analysed according to the phenomenographic approach. Results: The respondents perceived the existing co-work between conventional pharmacies and other health care professionals as limited. The availability of the satellite pharmacy enabled the health care professionals to understand the pharmacys' way of working, and to increase trust in the pharmacy staff. Collaboration was hence developed between the professions, leading to a consistent way of informing the patients about their HIV drugs, thereby avoiding contradictory information. The pharmacist also became involved in adherence promoting activities at the clinic. The perceived benefits for the patients were considered to be convenience and preservation of privacy as well as a better basis for safe and appropriate drug utilisation. Conclusion: Conventional pharmacies were shown to have several disadvantages in serving the HIV infected population. The health care professionals found the novel approach of dispensing HIV drugs at the clinic valuable. The approach led to increased communication and trust between the health care professions, and enhanced teamwork in medication management.","{""Baretta, K"",""Lindblad, ÅMK"",""Södergård, BMH"",""Tully, MP""}","10.1007/s11096-004-6608-z",2024-07-17 19:09:41,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2005,"{}","{""Community Pharmacy practice; health care personnel; HIV clinic; hospital pharmacy practice; medicati""}"
6862931,"Modeling And Analyzing Supply-Demand Relationships Of Water Resources In Xinjiang From A Perspective Of Ecosystem Services","Water shortage is one bottleneck that limits economic and social developments in arid and semi-arid areas. As the impacts of climate change and human disturbance intensify across time, uncertainties in both water resource supplies and demands increase in arid and semi-arid areas. Taking a typical arid region in China, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as an example, water yield depth (WYD) and water utilization depth (WUD) from 2002 to 2018 were simulated using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and socioeconomic data. The supply-demand relationships of water resources were analyzed using the ecosystem service indices including water supply-demand difference (WSDD) and water supply rate (WSR). The internal factors in changes of WYD and WUD were explored using the controlled variable method. The results show that the supply-demand relationships of water resources in Xinjiang were in a slight deficit, but the deficit was alleviated due to increased precipitation and decreased WUD of irrigation. WYD generally experienced an increasing trend, and significant increase mainly occurred in the oasis areas surrounding both the Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin. WUD had a downward trend with a decline of 20.70\%, especially in oasis areas. Water resources in most areas of Xinjiang were fully utilized and the utilization efficiency of water resources increased. The water yield module in the InVEST model was calibrated and validated using gauging station data in Xinjiang, and the result shows that the use of satellite-based water storage data helped to decrease the bias error of the InVEST model by 0.69x10(8) m(3). This study analyzed water resource supplies and demands from a perspective of ecosystem services, which expanded the scope of the application of ecosystem services and increased the research perspective of water resource evaluation. The results could provide guidance for water resource management such as spatial allocation and structural optimization of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas.","{""Li Feng"",""Li Yaoming"",""Liu Tie"",""Xin Qinchuan"",""Yin Zun"",""Zhou Xuewen""}","10.1007/s40333-022-0059-z",2024-07-19 20:28:55,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{""decreased bias error""}","{""ecosystem services; water resources; climate change; human activities; arid"",""semi-arid areas; InVEST model; Xinjiang""}"
6903660,"Distributional Implications Of Supply Constraints In Water Markets","In California, after three decades of water market development, volume of water traded in the market remains lower than desired. Total volume of water traded annually accounts for just around 2\%-5\% of total water used. Vast difference in the marginal values of water in agriculture and urban or environmental uses suggest that significant economic gains can be achieved by easing the barriers to trading water across sectors. This paper draws attention to the role of state and local policies in restricting water transfers. Using novel, purpose-built, satellite-mapped data of a sample of water-trading irrigation districts in California, this paper shows how districts' water transfer decisions are made in response to conflicting pressures of drought-induced high-water demand against the need to support the agricultural economy and the environment in water-exporting areas. The time period under study is 1991-2019, which spans the entire history of water market activity in California from inception to maturity, and helps illustrate the role of changing local and state policies on irrigation districts' water market participation. Despite policy-induced restrictions, this paper shows that sample irrigation districts are highly responsive to demand in water-buying areas, have increased the volume and frequency of water transfers, particularly in the last decade. This paper highlights important research and policy questions about the distribution of economic and environmental effects of water transfers in source area communities that could affect the future potential of water markets in easing structural and drought-induced water scarcity in California.",NA,"10.1061/(asce)wr.1943-5452.0001563",2024-09-27 23:20:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862861,"Salivary Biomarkers For Clinical Applications","For clinical applications such as monitoring health status, disease onset and progression, and treatment outcome, there are three necessary prerequisites: (i) a simple method for collecting biologic samples, ideally noninvasively; (ii) specific biomarkers associated with health or disease; and (iii) a technology platform to rapidly utilize the biomarkers. Saliva, often regarded as the 'mirror of the body', is a perfect surrogate medium to be applied for clinical diagnostics. Saliva is readily accessible via a totally noninvasive method. Salivary biomarkers, whether produced by healthy individuals or by individuals affected by specific diseases, are sentinel molecules that could be used to scrutinize health and disease surveillance. The visionary investment by the US National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, the discovery of salivary biomarkers, and the ongoing development of salivary diagnostic technologies have addressed its diagnostic value for clinical applications. The availability of more sophisticated analytic techniques gives optimism that saliva can eventually be placed as a biomedium for clinical diagnostics.

6863056,"The Influence Of Data Source And Species Distribution Modelling Method On Spatial Conservation Priorities","Aim Species distribution models are an important conservation tool; however, performance can vary with factors including data inputs and modelling method. Model outputs are often under-evaluated for explanatory and predictive capacity. Our aim was to evaluate the capacity of existing data for seven small mammal species to provide useful inferences for management planning. Location Bathurst and Melville (collectively the Tiwi) Islands, Northern Territory, Australia. Methods We developed species distribution models (SDMs) with generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs) using survey data (351 sites) of small mammals, with two sets of environmental predictors: (a) field-study measurements and (b) available remotely sensed rasters. Predictive capacity of models was evaluated using percentage of deviance explained (\%DE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used Marxan to evaluate the influence of different model and data types as input for identifying spatial priorities. Results Field-informed SDMs performed well across both modelling methods, with relatively high test AUC values (mean = 0.82, range = 0.64-0.97) and test \%DE (mean = 22.5\%, range = 3.5\%-65.8\%). Remotely sensed models performed relatively poorly, with lower test AUC values (mean = 0.7, range = 0.56-0.86) and lower test \%DE (mean = 8.9\%, range = 0.03\%-24.9\%). A notable exception was remotely sensed models for Melomys burtoni (AUC = 0.85 \& 0.86, \%DE = 23.3\% \& 24.9\%, Bathurst and Melville respectively). Marxan site irreplaceability rankings demonstrated low to marginal agreement using field-informed and remotely sensed inputs (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.3), and similarly, using GLM and BRT model inputs (0.29). Main conclusions The occurrence of small mammals on the Tiwi Islands can be reasonably explained with field-informed variables, but not with remotely sensed alternatives. Different models lead to different conservation priorities. Our work emphasizes the importance of thoroughly testing SDMs prior to decision-making.","{""Elith, Jane"",""Firth, Ronald S.

6863344,"Global Dam Watch: Curated Data And Tools For Management And Decision Making","Dams, reservoirs, and other water management infrastructure provide benefits, but can also have negative impacts. Dam construction and removal affects progress toward the UN sustainable development goals at local to global scales. Yet, globally-consistent information on the location and characteristics of these structures are lacking, with information often highly localised, fragmented, or inaccessible. A freely available, curated, consistent, and regularly updated global database of existing dams and other instream infrastructure is needed along with open access tools to support research, decision-making and management needs. Here we introduce the Global Dam Watch (GDW) initiative (www.globaldamwatch.org ) whose objectives are: (a) advancing recent efforts to develop a single, globally consistent dam and instream barrier data product for global-scale analyses (the GDW database); (b) bringing together the increasingly numerous global, regional and local dam and instream barrier datasets in a directory of databases (the GDW directory); (c) building tools for the visualisation of dam and instream barrier data and for analyses in support of policy and decision making (the GDW knowledge-base) and (d) advancing earth observation and geographical information system techniques to map a wider range of instream structures and their properties.Our focus is on all types of anthropogenic instream barriers, though we have started by prioritizing major reservoir dams and run-of-river barriers, for which more information is available. Our goal is to facilitate national-scale, basin-scale and global-scale mapping, analyses and understanding of all instream barriers, their impacts and their role in sustainable development through the provision of publicly accessible information and tools. We invite input and partnerships across sectors to strengthen GDW's utility and relevance for all, help define database content and knowledge-base tools, and generally expand the reach of GDW as a global hub of impartial academic expertise and policy information regarding dams and other instream barriers.","{""Beames, Penny"",""Belletti, Barbara"",""Brauman, Kate A."",""De Felice, Luca"",""Higgins, Jonathan"",""Januchowski-Hartley, Stephanie R."",""Lehner, Bernhard"",""Mandle, Lisa"",""Mazany-Wright, Nick"",""Mulligan, Mark"",""Thieme, Michele"",""Wang, Jida"",""Wen, Qingke"",""Yang, Xiao"",""Zarfl, Christiane"",""de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia"",""van Soesbergen, Arnout""}","10.1088/2634-4505/ac333a",2024-07-15 17:12:56,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""global; dam; data; tools""}"

Further data about each site, including the number of theatre suites, satellite anaesthetic areas, use of capnography and categories of patients treated (adult, obstetric and paediatric) were collected. An adult DDAC was found at 92% of all sites, but none of the sites had all the essential equipment listed in the ANZCA guidelines. There was limited provision of adult difficult airway equipment within private sites compared to public, and less provision of paediatric difficult airway equipment across all sites treating paediatric patients in metropolitan Perth.

6862873,"Controlling Established Invaders: Integrating Economics And Spread Dynamics To Determine Optimal Management","P>We review studies that address economically optimal control of established invasive species. We describe three important components for determining optimal invasion management: invasion dynamics, costs of control efforts and a monetary measure of invasion damages. We find that a management objective that explicitly considers both costs and damages is most appropriate for determining economically optimal strategies, but also leads to large challenges due to uncertainty in components of the management problem. To address uncertainty, some studies have included stochasticity in their models; others have quantified the value of information or focused on decision-making with limited information. Our synthesis shows how invasion characteristics, such as costs, damages, pattern of spread and invasion and landscape size, affect optimal control strategies and goals in systematic ways. We find that even for simple questions, such as whether control should be applied at the centre of an invasion or to satellite patches, the answer depends on the details of a particular invasion. Future work should seek to better quantify key components of this problem, determine best management in the face of limited information, improve understanding of spatial aspects of invasion control and design approaches to improve the feasibility of achieving regional control goals.","{""Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca S."",""Hastings, Alan""}","10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01440.x",2024-07-17 18:37:34,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2010,"{""satellite patches""}","{""Alien species; bioeconomics; biological invasions; noxious species; optimal control; spatial-dynamic""}"

Yet, in spite of its importance, the Floodplain has been vulnerable to land use change threatening wetland degradation albeit it being a Ramsar Cultural Heritage Site. This study aimed at determining the extent of land use change in the wetland of BFP in the selected years between 1980 and 2020 using Landsat data, then identifying and assessing drivers of land use change using survey data sets. In this study we hypothesized to determine the past and present status and change drivers of unprotected wetlands using a hybrid approach to help guide environment managers on the conservation of wetlands in a holistic manner. It also measured the relationship between drivers of land use change and observed land use changes pattern in the wetland of BFP. The study used an integrated research approach that involved utilizing combined methods of data collection and analysis. Both secondary and primary data sources were used. Primary data was collected using interview schedule, key informants' interviews, Participatory Rural Appraisal and field observations. The Raosoft random sample calculator was used to determine the sample size of heads of households from 9 districts within the margins of Barotse Floodplain. Then, a proportional sample size per district of 270 was calculated. The study found that there was an average land use change of 24.3\% and 0.78 annual change rate in the wetland of BFP in the years of 1984, 1996, 2004 and 2015. The land use classes annual change rates between 1984 and 2015 were: forest/woody vegetation (0.32), grassland (0.07), water (0.02), annually flooded land (0.11) and bare land (0.26). The delineated land cover area classes (forest/woody vegetation, grassland, water, annually flooded land and bare land) have been reducing except for bare land that was increasing in areal coverage. Water class had the greatest negative percentage change (decrease) of 0.04 between 1984 and 2015. While the class of bare land class had greatest positive change (increase) of 8.3 percent in the period of 1984 and 2015. It was found that from 1990 to 2016, there was precipitation variation the years between 1981 and 2016 where the lowest was 571.7 mm in 2016, highest 1 579 mm in 2008 and the average amount of rainfall in the same period was 879.5 mm. Therefore, in some years there was excessive rainfall and scant rainfall in other years, which affected hydrology in the wetland and consequently affecting its ecosystem functions. The study found that land use change was driven by climate variability (48.5\%), infrastructure development (20.7\%), technology (7.8\%), demography (18.5\%), and agriculture (4.4\%) using an integrated approach. Other land use changes such as the construction of a road bridge across the floodplain have contributed to wetland deterioration. The study further found that there was a relationship of 0.266 between driving forces of land use change and observed land use changes pattern. Therefore, the study demonstrated and provided new data that indicated the extent of land use change and its drivers using integrated research approach. The study recommends strategies such as environmental education and land use planning to resolve the problem of land use changes, in order to contribute to sustainable wetland management.","{""Banda, Arnold Mahonko"",""Banda, Kawawa"",""Chomba, Machaya"",""Nyambe, Imasiku Anayawa"",""Sakala, Enock""}","10.1007/s11069-022-05589-0",2024-07-19 21:09:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Barotse Floodplain; Drivers; Ecosystem; Land use change; Wetlands; Zambezi Basin""}"
6903559,"Integrated Seawater Intrusion And Groundwater Quality Assessment Of A Coastal Aquifer: Galdit, Geospatial And Analytical Approaches","The pressure and dependence on coastal aquifers are on the rise in many parts of the globe. These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast’s coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches—GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQISWI, total hardness, water quality index (WQI)—and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQISWI classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand’s TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29%, 59%, and 12% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQISWI analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32%. Total hardness values indicate that 67% of the aquifer’s coverage falls under the “moderately hard” category. The geodatabase creation introduced in the study provides a template for similar studies and a baseline for future WQI and water quality monitoring. However, temporal studies on chronological timescales are recommended for sustainable management of the aquifer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,"10.1007/s11356-021-18084-z",2024-10-03 22:07:20,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA

6862908,"Monitoring Land Surface Processes With Thermal Infrared Data: Calibration Of Svat Parameters Based On The Optimisation Of Diurnal Surface Temperature Cycling Features","Land Surface Models (LSM) have been designed to describe water and energy transfers at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface, and are therefore essential in many environmental disciplines. These numerical models, driven by the boundary conditions in the atmosphere and in the soil, require adequate knowledge of those vegetation and soil characteristics which are determinant in the characterisation of mass and energy transfers. In view of the fact that, firstly this information is often only partially known, and secondly the transfers are sometimes incorrectly represented, these models can rapidly drift and need to be regularly corrected. To this aim, remote sensing is a promising tool and many studies are currently devoted to the development of assimilation techniques to control their inputs or internal variables. The research presented in this paper contributes to this effort. Its ambition is to explore new methodologies, designed to make use of remote sensing thermal infrared data recorded from space. This study is based on the analysis of links between the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of the surface brightness temperature and the soil-atmosphere interface parameters and variables. The proposed methodology takes advantage of these temperatures cycling features, instead of absolute temperature values, to calibrate the LSM. The results show that the model parameters have a significant impact on the diurnal temperature dynamics, sometimes to a greater extent than on the temperature itself, and that these relationships have diurnal and seasonal variations. As a consequence, the use of TIR data for LSM calibration can be optimised by considering only those parts of the information which are really relevant to parameter calibration. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

6863417,"Monitor Land Degradation Phenomena Through Landscape Metrics And Ndvi: Gördes, Kavacιk, Ilιcak, Kumçay And Marmara Lake Basins (Turkey)","Rapid land use/cover change (LULC), land degradation and landscape fragmentation are occurring in Turkey, as a result of demographic pressure, agricultural expansion, government policies and environmental factors such as drought. This study analyzed the dynamics of LULC and land degradation as revealed in landscape fragmentation in the Gördes, Kavacιk, Ilιcak, Kumçay and Marmara Lake basins based on Landsat data for 1975 and 2000. A hybrid supervised/ unsupervised classification approach coupled with GIS analyses was employed to generate LULC maps. Various class-level Landscape Pattern Metrics (LPMs) were calculated using FRAGSTATS, in order to analyze landscape fragmentation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been prepared from the satellite data to understand the vigour and density of vegetation. The results indicated that the study area had a decrease in NDVI values, which meant a decrease in the vegetation cover, land degradation and the soil moisture during the study period. Consequently, the landscape became more highly fragmented. This suggests that anthropogenic activities driven by agricultural expansion were the main causes of landscape fragmentation, leading to landscape degradation in the study area. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Remote Sensing (RS) and the Geographical Information System (GIS) in detection, assessing, mapping, monitoring and generating essential quantitative information on the land degradation. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","{""Taǧil, Ş""}","10.3923/jas.2007.1827.1842",2024-09-30 01:57:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2007,"{}","{Desertification}"
6903575,"Subways And Co2 Emissions: A Global Analysis With Satellite Data","This paper estimates a global CO2 emissions model using satellite data at 25 km resolution. The model incorporates industrial sources (including power, steel, cement, and refineries), fires, and non-industrial population-related factors associated with household incomes and energy requirements. It also tests the impact of subways in the 192 cities where they operate. We find highly significant effects with the expected signs for all model variables, including subways. In a counterfactual exercise estimating CO2 emissions with and without subways, we find they have reduced population-related CO2 emissions by about 50 \% for the 192 cities and about 11 \% globally. Extending the analysis to future subways for other cities, we estimate the magnitude and social value of CO2 emissions reductions with conservative assumptions about population and income growth and a range of values for the social cost of carbon and investment costs. Even under pessimistic assumptions for these costs, we find that hundreds of cities realize a significant climate co-benefit, along with benefits from reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, which have traditionally motivated subway construction. Under more moderate assumptions, we find that, on climate grounds alone, hundreds of cities realize high enough social rates of return to warrant subway construction.",NA,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163691",2024-09-26 01:01:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

The article presents a fire risk model based on the identification of the major factors that contribute to forest fire, namely, vegetation type, vegetation density, land surface temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance from settlements, rivers and roads, and then integrating them using a multi-criteria decision-making technique in a GIS framework. We document that more than 50% of the area of all the districts except North Sikkim falls into high to moderate risk zones. The model shows that 61% of fire information for resource management system data for the last 16 years coincide with the mapped high-risk zone of the state. Areas with low slope and with moderate vegetation density fall into very high risk, whereas areas with high slope and with high vegetation density correspond to moderate risk zones. Further, aspect and density of human intervention differentiate the very high and high-risk zones of the region.

6862891,"Models Of Earth's Main Magnetic Field Incorporating Flux And Radial Vorticity Constraints","We describe a new technique for implementing the constraints on magnetic fields arising from two hypotheses about the fluid core of the Earth, namely the frozen-flux hypothesis and the hypothesis that the core is in magnetostrophic force balance with negligible leakage of current into the mantle. These hypotheses lead to time-independence of the integrated flux through certain 'null-flux patches' on the core surface, and to time-independence of their radial vorticity. Although the frozen-flux hypothesis has received attention before, constraining the radial vorticity has not previously been attempted. We describe a parametrization and an algorithm for preserving topology of radial magnetic fields at the core surface while allowing morphological changes. The parametrization is a spherical triangle tesselation of the core surface. Topology with respect to a reference model (based on data from the Oersted satellite) is preserved as models at different epochs are perturbed to optimize the fit to the data; the topology preservation is achieved by the imposition of inequality constraints on the model, and the optimization at each iteration is cast as a bounded value least-squares problem. For epochs 2000, 1980, 1945, 1915 and 1882 we are able to produce models of the core field which are consistent with flux and radial vorticity conservation, thus providing no observational evidence for the failure of the underlying assumptions. These models are a step towards the production of models which are optimal for the retrieval of frozen-flux velocity fields at the core surface.","{""Constable, C. G."",""Jackson, A."",""Parker, R.

6661281,"An Analysis Of The Spatial And Temporal Changes In Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Service Functions","Since Westman (1977) and Ehrlich (1982) put forward the concepts of ""the service of nature"" and ""ecosystem service functions"", respectively, methods for conducting value accounting for them, and their practical application have become the subjects of intense study. Based on an overview of available research findings, we discuss three scientific hypotheses. First, the terrestrial ecosystem offers both positive and negative service functions. Second, changes in terrestrial ecosystem service functions lie not only in the number of ecosystem types and the coverage area of each type, but also in their quality. Third, the value of terrestrial ecosystem service functions should be assessed both in terms of the value stocked and the value added. We collected land use data from China during the period 1999-2008, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data based on remote sensing images from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies for the same period. We then calculated and analyzed spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service values over the 10-year period. Considering temporal change, the total value (stocked) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions decreased from 6.82 trillion Yuan RMB in 1999 to 6.57 trillion Yuan RMB in 2008. During that period, the positive value decreased by 240.17 billion Yuan RMB and the negative value increased by 8.85 billion Yuan RMB. The decrease in total value lies mainly in the humidity control, soil formation, and waste recycling functions. The total value (added) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions increased by 4.31 billion Yuan RMB in 2000, but decreased by 0.13 billion Yuan RMB in 2008 (based on the constant price of China in 1999). The value (added) was a negative figure. From the perspective of spatial change, we can see that the supply of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions fell slightly over the past 10 years, mainly in Northeast and Southern China. As a result of human activities on ecosystems, the loss of ecosystem service functions' value was relatively prominent in Shanxi and Gansu provinces, compared with an increase in value in Shaanxi Province. Terrestrial ecosystem service functions' value per unit area was relatively high in mid- and East China, showing a prominent spatial change over the 10-year period, but low in Western China. Some conclusions are drawn after an in-depth analysis of the factors causing the spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions, in the hope that our suggestions will be helpful for the management of China's terrestrial ecosystems.","{""Huang JinLou"",""Shi Yao"",""Wang RuSong"",""Yang WenRui""}","10.1007/s11434-012-4978-5",2024-04-11 22:10:51,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2012,"{cco}","{""China's terrestrial ecosystems; ecosystem service functions; positive"",""negative value accounting; analysis of spatial"",""temporal change""}"
6903615,"Over-Harvesting Driven By Consumer Demand Leads To Population Decline: Big-Leaf Mahogany In South America","Consumer demand for the premier neotropical luxury timber, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), has driven boom-and-bust logging cycles for centuries, depleting local and regional supplies from Mexico to Bolivia. We revise the standard historic range map for mahogany in South America and estimate the extent to which commercial stocks have been depleted using satellite data, expert surveys, and sawmill processing center data from Brazil. We estimate an historic range of 278 million hectares spanning Venezuela to Bolivia, 57\% of this in Brazil. Approximately 58 million hectares (21\%) of mahogany's historic range had been lost to forest conversion by 2001. Commercial populations had been logged from at least 125 million more hectares, reducing the commercial range to 94 million hectares (34\% of historic). Surviving stocks are extremely low-density populations in remote regions representing a smaller fraction of historic stocks than expected based on estimated current commercial range. Our method could advance international policy debates such as listing proposals for CITES Appendices by clarifying the commercial and conservation status of high-value timber species similar to mahogany about which little information is available.

6863484,"An Extraction, Analysis, And Prioritization Of Asna River Sub-Basins, Based On Geomorphometric Parameters Using Geospatial Tools","The Asna river basin is located in Hingoli and Nanded districts of Marathwada region of Maharashtra. A geomorphometric analysis is an important method for the investigation and management of natural resources of watershed. The geomorphometric analysis of Asna river basin classifies three sub-basins that have been delineated using GIS and remote sensing through measurements of linear, aerial, and relief aspects. The Asna river basin comprises an area of 1187km(2) with seventh-order drainage pattern. As per Strahler classification, the upper part of the basin shows dendritic to sub-dendritic and the lower part exhibits parallel to sub-parallel drainage pattern. The total numbers of stream segments are 2422 and length of streams is 2187.92km. The bifurcation value ranges from 1.26 to 5.58 indicating that there are no structural disturbances. The form factor value (0.49) indicates that the shape of the basin is moderately circular. The high values of drainage density, stream frequency, and low infiltration number indicate the high runoff due to impermeable lithology. The slope of the basin varies from 1 to 32.2\%, terrain elevation ranges from 333 to 551m, and overall relief of the basin is 218m amsl. River sub-basin prioritization has an immense importance in natural resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. The present study is an attempt to prioritize the sub-basins of Asna river based on geomorphometric parameters. The weightage is assigned to different morphometric parameters of sub-basins based on erosion potential. The Asna river sub-basins have been classified into three categories as high, medium, and low on the basis of priorities for soil and water conservation. It is confirmed that sub-basin I is characterized as highly vulnerable to erosion and has high sedimentation load; sub-basin II has low priority, i.e., very low erodibility; and sub-basin III is of moderate type. The morphometric analysis and prioritization methods can be applied to hydrological studies in surface as well as subsurface water, climatic studies, rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharging sites, and watershed management.","{""Mukate, Shrikant"",""Panaskar, Dipak"",""Sahu, Uday"",""Wagh, Vasant""}","10.1007/s12517-018-3870-2",2024-07-16 23:27:37,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Asna River; Sub-basins; Geomorphometric analysis; Geospatial tools; Prioritization""}"
6863487,"Albedo Impact On The Suitability Of Biochar Systems To Mitigate Global Warming","Biochar application to agricultural soils can change the surface albedo which could counteract the climate mitigation benefit of biochar systems. However, the size of this impact has not yet been quantified. Based on empirical albedo measurements and literature data of arable soils mixed with biochar, a model for annual vegetation cover development based on satellite data and an assessment of the annual development of surface humidity, an average mean annual albedo reduction of 0.05 has been calculated for applying 30-32 Mg ha -1 biochar on a test field near Bayreuth, Germany. The impact of biochar production and application on the carbon cycle and on the soil albedo was integrated into the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a modeled pyrolysis based biochar system via the computation of global warming potential (GWP) characterization factors. The analysis resulted in a reduction of the overall climate mitigation benefit of biochar systems by 13-22% due to the albedo change as compared to an analysis which disregards the albedo effect. Comparing the use of the same quantity of biomass in a biochar system to a bioenergy district heating system which replaces natural gas combustion, bioenergy heating systems achieve 99-119% of the climate benefit of biochar systems according to the model calculation. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","{""Bright, R.

Additionally, special focus is placed on the analysis of the forest areas and the possible use of NDVI in the forest management sector. Results of the NDVI applied through Idrisi software identify all vegetation cover types and their typical values for presented case studies and observed periods. Obtained results for Serbian case studies indicate two major observations outlined for the investigated period. It was noticed that vegetation cover is experiencing a certain decrease, and that certain discrepancies exists between the NDVI and official forest area statistics for certain municipalities. The study outlines the positive outcomes of the applied remote sensing techniques, especially for southern Serbian municipalities where illegal logging activities are pronounced.

6863595,"Connectivity Shapes Delivery Of Multiple Ecological Benefits From Restoration","Connectivity and landscape context are common considerations in the spatial prioritisation of conservation actions. Similar spatial principles can also be used to inform the selection, prioritisation and monitoring of sites for restoration, but it is not clear whether these variables consistently shape the delivery of benefits from restoration. This study aimed to determine whether, and how, seascape connectivity and landscape context combine to influence the recovery of fish and crustacean communities at a restoring coastal wetland. We measured changes to biodiversity (fish species richness), fisheries benefits (fisheries harvested abundance) and functioning (fish functional diversity) bi-annually at a 200 ha restoring wetland, and three control sites, in eastern Australia between 2017 and 2021. Connectivity and landscape context were quantified using a combination of in-field measurements, remote sensing techniques and least-cost path analysis. Biodiversity, fisheries benefits, and functional diversity increased at the restoration site over time, but these metrics did not change significantly at any of the control sites over the same time period. The delivery of each of the three co-benefits at the restoration site was also positively linked to increased wetland connectivity, larger areas of mangroves and higher salinity levels in the recovering seascape. These results support tighter integration of connectivity and landscape context to optimise and inform spatial planning in restoration, and we suggest that this is essential for supporting the delivery of multiple benefits from recovering habitats and seascapes. Adopting similar approaches to understand the drivers of restoration success would improve the ecological and economic outcomes of actions.","{""Borland, Hayden P."",""Gilby, Ben L."",""Hazell, Jackson J."",""Henderson, Christopher J."",""Leon, Javier X."",""Mosman, Jesse D."",""Olds, Andrew D."",""Rummell, Ashley J.""}","10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110358",2024-09-30 17:21:11,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Co-benefits; Biodiversity; Wetlands; Fisheries; Landscape context; Spatial planning""}"
6863271,"Canopy Adjustment And Improved Cloud Detection For Remotely Sensed Snow Cover Mapping","Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30-40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas. Plain Language Summary Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow-covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can ""see,"" especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite-based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30-40\% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow-mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non-snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow-melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live.","{""Dozier, Jeff"",""Hill, Alice F."",""Lutz, James A."",""Painter, Thomas H."",""Raleigh, Mark S."",""Rittger, Karl""}","10.1029/2019wr024914",2024-07-18 20:56:15,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{calibration}",NA

6903540,"Effects Of Land Cover On Ecosystem Services In Tanzania: A Spatial Assessment Of Soil Organic Carbon","The multiple ecosystem services provided by healthy soil are well known and include soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, a medium for plant and agricultural production and regulating the hydrologic cycle. Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of >0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. © 2015.",NA,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.03.010",2024-10-01 17:26:01,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6903482,"Review Of Remote Sensing Algorithms For Monitoring Forest Disturbance From Time Series And Multi-Source Data Fusion","Spatio-temporally explicit forest disturbance information is regarded as a critical mechanism for net ecosystem productivity. However, quantitative and spatio-temporally explicit information on forest disturbance is currently rare for most regions of the world. Unique among earth observation programs, Landsat data are systematically collected and archived following a global acquisition strategy. The provision of free, robust data products since 2008 has spurred a renaissance of interest in Landsat and resulted in an increasingly widespread use of Landsat Time Series (LTS) for multi-temporal characterizations. The science and application capacity of Landsat have developed steadily since 1972, with the increase in sophistication offered over time incorporated into Landsat processing and analysis practices. With the successful launch of Landsat-8, the continuity of measures at scales of relevance to management and scientific activities is ensured in a short time. The spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution offered by Landsat data is well suited, increasingly established, and operational in usage for forest management and analysis. Particularly, forest change detection algorithms based on LTS stack provide robust tools for detecting near real-time forest ecosystem changes, whereby a baseline of conditions can be determined for both abrupt and gradual changes and attributed to different drivers. Interest in LTS has been further enhanced by the recent introduction of several novel automated data processing techniques suitable for multi-temporal analysis, especially after the successful launch of highly spatio-temporal resolution satellites. The benefits are enabled by data availability, analysis-ready image products, increased computing power and storage, and sophisticated image processing approaches. Thus, change detection research for forest disturbance with time series remote sensing data has entered a brand-new stage. This review systematically summarizes the research progress and application of multi-temporal forest disturbance monitoring methods based on remote sensing data sources. Considering the significance and advantage of applying time series analysis in change detection, data availability selection, and data processing, various spectral indexes and dense time automatic monitoring methods for forest disturbance are analyzed extensively, and the characteristics of multi-source data and algorithms are summarized. Finally, the improvements based on the existing limitations are explored. At the time of this review, three forest disturbance change detection algorithms are commonly used for LTS: spectral variables, classification analysis, and trajectory analysis. Spectral-based techniques range from single-band reflectance to a host of indexes calculated from different algebraic manipulations of the original spectral bands and their derivatives. Classification-based techniques are an extension of traditional change detection techniques based on two-year images. Trajectory-based methods identify trends and breakpoints corresponding to disturbance events, stability, and recovery time, and they are useful for characterizing different disturbance regimes. The strength and limitations of each method prior to conducting an LTS analysis should be understood by forestry and remote sensing communities, who should ideally select a given method depending on their information needs. In summary, unprecedented advances in the assessment of forest disturbance have been realized in recent and future years using LTS data combined with other high spatial and temporal resolution imagery, especially domestic satellites as information sources. © 2018, Science Press.

6863334,"Streamflow Regionalization Considering Water Balance With Actual Evapotranspiration Estimated From Remote Sensing","Streamflow regionalization is a technique used in areas where hydrological data are scarce or nonexistent. Although numerous studies have been conducted with the aim of improving this technique, unsatisfactory results are still evident. This study, therefore, aims to propose and evaluate the performance of a new explanatory variable for regionalization, which represents the streamflow formation process and considers the actual evapotranspiration (ETR) obtained from remote sensing products. For this purpose, the regional regression method was used to estimate long-term mean streamflow and minimum flow with 90\% of permanence in time. The explanatory variables were the precipitated volume (Peq), precipitated volume minus the empirical value of 750 mm (Peq(750)), water balance for each segment of the water course (WBeq), and water balance for each hydrologically homogenous region (WBeqM). These variables were obtained using a combination of drainage area, precipitation, and ETR. The ETR was estimated using two remote sensing products: MOD16 and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model. The models of streamflow regionalization were evaluated by statistical, physical, and risk analyses. The study was applied for Grande River basin. All the variables, with the exception of Peq, presented good statistical performance, good representativeness of regionalized streamflows, and safe estimates for the planning and management of water resources. The WBeq(G) was the most recommended variable for streamflow regionalization in Grande River basin, because it considers variations in edaphoclimatic and vegetative conditions along the basin. This work contributes to improving the predictive capacity of the streamflow through a method that is potentially applicable to other areas of study, allows easy physical interpretation, utilizes easily obtained variables, and represents the streamflow formation process.

6903662,"Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of No2 Concentration With Linear Mixed Models: A Bangladesh Case Study","There is currently a limited understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic factors affect atmospheric NO2 concentration, and how these factors are associated with air pollution over space and time. Using high-resolution TROPOMI satellite data, this study estimates both the degree of association between climatic and anthropogenic factors, and the spatiotemporal variability of NO2 concentration over Bangladesh. Several linear mixed models were developed to isolate possible factors affecting the NO2 concentration values recorded between July 2018 and June 2019). This included monthly mean maximum temperature (MMAXT), rainfall, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), population density, and distance from industrial activities. The study revealed that the very urbanized central region of Bangladesh experienced high NO2 concentrations, particularly from September through to March. Dynamic variables such as RH, MMAXT, RAIN, and WS can positively or negatively influence NO2 depending on the time of year. Areas with a high vegetation cover, a low population density, and located some distance from industrial areas tended to have low NO2 concentrations. This study concluded that policy measures such as transboundary air quality agreements, the introduction of a month-specific green tax, decentralization, industrial relocation, and increased urban tree plantation activities could all prove valuable in reducing NO2 pollution in Bangladesh.",NA,"10.1016/j.pce.2022.103119",2024-10-03 21:50:42,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863703,"Monitoring Needs To Transform Amazonian Forest Maintenance Into A Global Warming-Mitigation Option","Two approaches are frequently mentioned in proposals to use tropical forest maintenance as a carbon offset. One is to set up specific reserves, funding the establishment, demarcation, and guarding of these units. Monitoring, in this case, consists of the relatively straightforward process of confirming that the forest stands in question continue to exist. In Amazonia, where large expanses of tropical forest still exist, the reserve approach has the logical weakness of being completely open to ""leakage"": with the implantation of any given reserve, the people who would have been deforesting in the reserve area will probably continue to clear the same amount of forest somewhere else in the region. The second approach is through policy changes aimed at reducing the rate of clearing, but not limited to specific reserves or areas of forest. This second approach addresses more fundamental aspects of the tropical deforestation problem, but has the disadvantages of not assuring the permanence of forest and of not resulting in a visible product that can be convincingly credited to the existence of the project. In order for credit to be assigned to policy change projects, functioning models of the deforestation process must be developed that arc capable of producing scenarios with and without different policy changes. This requires understanding the process of deforestation, which depends on monitoring in order to have information as a time series. Information is needed both from satellite imagery and from on-thc-ground observations on who occupies the land and why the observed changes occur. Monitoring must be done by individual property if causal factors are to be identified reliably; this is best achieved using a database in a Geographical Information System (GIS) that includes property boundaries. Once policy changes arc made in practice, not only deforestation but also the policies themselves must be monitored. Decrees and laws are not the same as changes in practice; the initiation and continued application of changes must therefore be confirmed regularly. The value of carbon benefits from Amazonia depends directly on the credibility and transparency of monitoring. The great potential value of carbon maintenance in Amazonia should provide ample reason for Amazonian countries to strengthen and increase the transparency of their monitoring efforts. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","{""Fearnside, P.

6863071,"Hiv Drug Resistance Surveillance For Prioritizing Treatment In Resource-Limited Settings","Background: Sentinel testing programs for HIV drug resistance in resource-limited settings can inform policy on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and drug sequencing. Objective: To examine the value of resistance surveillance in influencing recommendations toward effective and cost-effective sequencing of ART regimens. Methods: A state-transition model of HIV infection was adapted to simulate clinical care in Cote d'Ivoire and evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of (1) no ART; (2) ART beginning with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen followed by a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen; and (3) ART beginning with a boosted PI-based regimen followed by an NNRTI-based regimen. Results: At a 5\% prevalence of NNRTI resistance, a strategy that started with a PI-based regimen had a smaller health benefit and higher cost-effectiveness ratio than a strategy that started with an NNRTI-based regimen (cost-effectiveness ratio \$910/year of life saved). Results consistently favored initiation with an NNRTI-based regimen, regardless of the population prevalence of NNRTI resistance (up to 76\%) and the efficacy of an NNRTI-based regimen in the setting of resistance. The most influential parameters on the cost-effectiveness of sequencing strategies were boosted PI-based regimen costs and the efficacy of this regimen when used as second-line therapy. Conclusions: Drug costs and treatment efficacies, but not NNRTI resistance levels, were most influential in determining optimal HIV drug sequencing in Cote d'Ivoire. Results of surveillance for NNRTI resistance should not be used as a major guide to treatment policy in resource-limited settings.

6863534,"Water Use Efficiency-Based Multiscale Assessment Of Ecohydrological Resilience To Ecosystem Shifts Over The Continent Of Africa During 1992-2015","The spatial-temporal representation is a crucial key for understanding at what extent terrestrial ecosystems can maintain their structure and functions and recover from various ecosystem shifts (drought/wet). Hence, it is vital for sustainable ecosystem management, adaptation, and mitigation practices. This study assessed ecohydrological resilience to ecosystem shifts at contrast water-limited and well-watered regions at multiple scales (i.e., country scale, basin scale, climate type scale, and land cover scale) over Africa during the period 1992-2015, based on Standard Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) and water use efficiency (WUE) at ecosystem scales, which was obtained from satellite-derived evapotranspiration (ET) and simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) using the Carnegie-ames-stanford approaches (CASA) model. SEDI values indicated that 11 years were characterized by dry conditions, while 13 were wetter years during 1992-2015. WUE, ET, and GPP values indicated increased tendencies mostly in central to central west of African continent. The ecohydrological resilience exhibited that about 68.78\% of African terrestrial ecosystems were highly, moderately, or slightly resilient, and about 31.22\% were not resilient to ecosystem shifts with 11.28\% vulnerably exposed to high risk of ecosystem shift and severely nonresilient. The extent areas exposed to severe ecohydrological nonresilience are distributed in Savannas and barelands land cover types, temperate-dry summer-hot summer (Csa), climate type, Mediterranean South Coast (B14), African-North interior (B3), and Red Sea-Golf of Aden Coast (b5) basins; and the four countries, namely, Egypt, Mauritania, Niger, and Tunisia. These findings may provide insightful scientific information about vulnerable regions for policy making and ecosystem management and increase the necessary awareness for taking reasonable adaptation mechanisms, such as afforesting open lands to increase the area of vegetation cover (i.e., choosing the drought or wet-tolerant plant species) and water conservation and management measures to ensure the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems under ecosystem shifts over the African continent.","{""Bofana, Jose"",""Chen, Baozhang"",""Dilawar, Adil"",""Karamage, Fidele"",""Kayiranga, Alphonse"",""Measho, Simon"",""Ndayisaba, Felix"",""Nthangeni, Winny"",""Sun, Shaobo"",""Trisurat, Yongyut"",""Tuankrua, Venus"",""Wang, Fei"",""Zhang, Huifang""}","10.1029/2020jg005749",2024-07-19 23:50:07,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}",NA

To determine the factors to be included in the model, factors identified in previous studies were prepared using remote sensing and were evaluated by the information gain ratio (IGR) method and the multicollinearity diagnostic test, and ultimately 10 factors with the highest IGR values were chosen as the most effective factors in the region. The flood inventory map was produced by processing the Sentinel-1 satellite data. The gathered data were used to map flood susceptibility maps with the SVM model optimized with IWO and ACO. The prediction accuracy of the models was evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). While both optimization algorithms are effective in improving the performance of SVM, the hybrid of SVM with IWO shows the best performance in terms of statistical measures and Friedman test results. The results of the study confirm the good performance of the proposed models in spatial prediction of flood susceptible areas. Since over half of the urban lands of the city of Zahedan are at moderate to very high risk of flooding, this area needs more attention in terms of flood prevention and control measures. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","{""Irandoost, M."",""Jalalkamali, N."",""Mirkazemi, S.

In England, county governments were created to provide regional representation for the Crown, with sheriffs responsible for collecting taxes, adjudicating disputes among residents and between residents and the Crown, and enforcing the laws of the Crown. County governments are developing new roles as home rule charters and legislative acts have expanded their authority and responsibility as local governments since World War II.

6862765,"Estimating The Conservation Value Of Protected Areas In Maritime Canada For Two Species At Risk: The Olive-Sided Flycatcher (Contopus Cooperi) And Canada Warbler (Cardellina Canadensis)","The Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi) and Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) are threatened landbirds in Canada and parts of the U.S. Both species are subjects of recent conservation and management interest. Protected areas are a key tool for managing populations of species at risk, and Canadian national parks may serve as important refuges in an increasingly fragmented landscape. However, the potential role that Canadian national parks may play in the recovery of these species is unclear. We used the Boreal Avian Modelling Project point count database to build Poisson log-linear models using forward stepwise variable selection to predict population density and distribution of these two threatened species in four national parks in Maritime Canada. We also predicted population density in areas of equivalent size in the same ecoregions outside the parks for comparison. Because forested wetlands, a key habitat for these species in this region, are difficult to represent with available spatial data, we tested the effectiveness of different remote sensing products. We tested GIS layers based on aerial photography wetlands (WETLANDS), depth to water table (WETNESS), and WETNESS as interacted with forest cover from aerial photography (WETxFOR). The best-performing models for the Olive-sided Flycatcher used WETxFOR, whereas WETNESS performed best for the Canada Warbler. Anthropogenic disturbance and proximity to roads had a negative effect on predicted density for both species. Protected areas showed slightly higher Olive-sided Flycatcher population densities than nearby areas, but not so for the Canada Warbler. Our results provide the first population density and population size estimates for these species in these parks, and novel information on the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on predicted population density. These results can inform conservation and management in this region and our approach can be replicated in other regions to support ongoing recovery efforts.","{""Bayne, Erin M."",""Fontaine, Trish"",""Hache, Samuel"",""Mazerolle, Dan"",""Solymos, Peter"",""Staicer, Cindy"",""Westwood, Alana R.""}","10.5751/ace-01359-140116",2024-07-17 21:31:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{maybe}","{""Canada Warbler; conservation; Olive-sided Flycatcher; parks"",""protected areas; species at risk; species distribution models""}"
6863382,"Predicting The Current And Future Potential Spatial Distribution Of Endangered Rucervus Eldii Eldii (Sangai) Using Maxent Model","Ecological factors that control the species distribution patterns at various spatiotemporal scales will get affected by climate change. To combat the situation, in the past few decades geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing have been widely used by the researchers in the field of wildlife and habitat suitability modeling. The main objective of this study is to map and predict the current and future habitat suitability potential of Rucervus eldii eldii in Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP) using MaxEnt. Presence location data of the species, topographic factors, and bio-climatic variables were used as input in the MaxEnt software to map current habitat suitability potential. To map the habitat suitability potential for future, two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the years 2050 and 2070 were used. The model returned an average AUC value of 0.944 which indicates the model to be sensitive and descriptive. Isothermality and precipitation in the wettest quarter were found to be two most significant variables. The suitable range of precipitation in the wettest quarter for Rucervus eldii eldii varies from 1365 to 1410 mm with an optimal value of 1405 mm and isothermality from 46.43 to 46.6% with an optimal value of 46.5%. Current habitat suitability results of the model show 0.45 km2 of the area under no potential, 29.25 km2 of the area under least potential, 8.29 km2 of the area under moderate potential, 9.21 km2 of the area under good potential, and 8.82 km2 of the area under high potential. Both RCPs for the years 2050 and 2070 show the decreasing trend in the area under high suitability potential and increasing trend under no suitability potential.

Easy-to-use, intuitive virtual globe technologies such as Google Earth™ enable scientists around the world to share their data and research results in a visually attractive and readily understandable fashion without the need for highly sophisticated geographical information systems (GIS) or much technical assistance. This paper discusses the utility of the rapid and simultaneous visualization of how the agents of parasitic diseases are distributed, as well as that of their vectors and/or intermediate hosts together with other spatially-explicit information. The resulting better understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and the multidimensional environment in which they occur, are highlighted. In particular, the value of Google Earth™, and its web-based pendant Google Maps™, are reviewed from a public health view point, combining results from literature searches and experiences gained thus far from a multidisciplinary project aimed at optimizing schistosomiasis control and transmission surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the basic analytical capabilities of virtual globe applications are limited, we conclude that they have considerable potential in the support and promotion of the geospatial health sciences as a userfriendly, straightforward GIS tool for the improvement of data collation, visualization and exploration.

6862817,"Uav-Based Partially Sampling System For Rapid Ndvi Mapping In The Evaluation Of Rice Nitrogen Use Efficiency","Rapid acquisition and mapping of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values is essential for a timely evaluation of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in sustainable agriculture. The zonal nutrient management techniques for sustainable agriculture require timely and efficient NDVI data collection and analysis capabilities, - a need that is still rarely addressed. However, as with the use of manned aircraft, the primary limitation of established unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging technologies is the limited time window for large-area data collection. Furthermore, as the spatial resolution increases, the post-processing time generally becomes longer. To overcome problems associated with the need for rapid data acquisition and post-processing, we have developed a UAV-based sensor system called the Accurate and Speed Scanner (AS-Scanner). The data acquisition accuracy and NDVI mapping speed of the system were assessed. According to the results of a ground-level experiment, the mean absolute error (MAE) between the reflectance data of the AS-Scanner and the corresponding data of the ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer is less than 1.11\%. Furthermore, results of a plot-level experiment suggest that the NDVI values of a raw point cloud from AS-Scanner-based UAV platform (AS-NDVI) and UAV-mounted Mica-Sense RedEdge camera (REG-NDVI) are highly correlated (0.54 < R-2 < 0.57, p < 0.01). In a map-level experiment, the interpolated, 15 m x 15 m pixel size AS-NDVI values were in good agreement with the REG-NDVIs over a 4.01 ha (40100 m(2)) rice field (0.55 < R-2 < 0.65, p < 0.01). The average processing times of the inverse distance weighted (IDW, 0.45 s), kriging linear (KL, 0.73 s), and nearest neighbor (NN, 1.05 s) interpolations of the AS-Scanner data prove that it is possible to efficiently create NDVI maps using data from the sensor. Besides, the effect of the varying solar irradiance values on the AS-NDVIs was analyzed under varied illumination conditions. Moreover, the AS-NDVIs were also used to assess the NUE in a paddy rice field at the panicle stage. The results show that nutrients can be effectively assessed using AS-Scanner data. Despite some disadvantages such as the potential of NDVI value saturation over dense canopies, the AS-Scanner provides a method for quickly obtaining reasonable spatial resolution crop information for agricultural nutrient monitoring and management. This also offers the potential to reduce environmental pressure which may be caused by untimely estimation of NUE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

6691604,"The evolution of Earth Observation satellites in Europe and its impact on the performance of emergency response services","The paper reviews the evolution of Earth Observation systems in Europe and Worldwide and analyses the potential impact of their performance in support of emergency response services. Earth Observation satellites play already a significant role in supporting the action of first responders in case of major disasters. The main principle is the coordinated use of satellites in order to ensure a rapid response and the timely delivery of images and geospatial information of the area affected by the event. The first part of the paper reviews the main instruments and evaluates their current performance.\nThe International Charter “Space and Major Disasters”, signed in October 2000, was the first international initiative aimed at establishing a unified system for the acquisition of space data. The charter is a cooperation agreement between space agencies and operators of space systems. At regional level, a similar instrument exists in Asia: Sentinel-Asia. In the frame of the European programme Copernicus, the emergency management service was launched in 2009. Geo-information products derived from space imagery are delivered during all phases of the emergency management cycle, in either rush or non-rush mode, free of charge for the users. In both cases, the capacities were historically drawn from national missions, funded with public money and directly operated by the space agencies or by national operators.                                                                 \nThe paper focuses on the performance of the space infrastructure (satellites and ground segments).

6903538,"Can More Accurate Night-Time Remote Sensing Data Simulate A More Detailed Population Distribution?","Aging, shrinking cities, urban agglomerations and other new key terms continue to emerge when describing the large-scale population changes in various cities in mainland China. It is important to simulate the distribution of residential populations at a coarse scale to manage cities as a whole, and at a fine scale for policy making in infrastructure development. This paper analyzes the relationship between the DN (Digital number, value assigned to a pixel in a digital image) value of NPP-VIIRS (the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LuoJia1-01 and the residential populations of urban areas at a district, sub-district, community and court level, to compare the influence of resolution of remote sensing data by taking urban land use to map out auxiliary data in which first-class (R1), second-class (R2) and third-class residential areas (R3) are distinguished by house price. The results show that LuoJia1-01 more accurately analyzes population distributions at a court level for second- and third-class residential areas, which account for over 85\% of the total population. The accuracy of the LuoJia1-01 simulation data is higher than that of Landscan and GHS (European Commission Global Human Settlement) population. This can be used as an important tool for refining the simulation of residential population distributions. In the future, higher-resolution night-time light data could be used for research on accurate simulation analysis that scales down large-scale populations.",NA,"10.3390/su11164488",2024-09-27 22:28:38,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6903551,"Effects Of Land Use Transitions Due To Rapid Urbanization On Ecosystem Services: Implications For Urban Planning In The New Developing Area Of China","With the rapid development of Chinese economy, many negative effects of land use transitions under the pressure of rapid urbanization on local ecological system and environment have occurred. This paper examines the dynamic patterns of land use in Tianjin Binhai New Area experienced rapid urbanization, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2010, and socioeconomic data from both research institutes and government departments, and assesses the changes of ecosystem services value (ESV) by drawing a connection between the observed land use dynamics and the evaluation of ESV, based on the latest research of Costanza et al. (2014) and some revisions adapted to the situation of China. The outcomes indicated that, during the period 1985-2010, ESV of the study area decreased by 25.9\%, from 12,194 to 9037 billion RMBY, due to the losses of large quantities of ecological land (e.g., farmland and water body) to construction land. Then, some of the major implications for improving the urban planning of Tianjin Binhai New Area were discussed. The authors argue that it is fundamental to meet the demand of construction land for socio-economic development, meanwhile protect regional ecosystem services function and maintain its stability; only in this way can the new developing area of China realize the sustainable use of ecological resources in the process of rapid urbanization, as well as the integration of economic, social and ecological benefits.

6691728,"Economic Value of Current and Improved Weather Forecasts in the U.S. Household Sector","The National Weather Service (NWS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the primary federal agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of weather forecast information. With an annual budget of about $1,383 million, the average U.S. household pays about $13 a year for the services of the NWS. There is little if any reliable economic information indicating whether these services are worth this $13 a year to households, although it is widely assumed that the benefits far exceed the costs. Furthermore, there is even less information on the value to households of potential improvements to or changes in current weather forecasting services. As NOAA considers new programs and implements new technologies, it is likely to be asked to justify proposed new expenditures using a benefit-cost framework. This study was commissioned to assist in evaluating and quantifying, to the extent possible, the benefits to households of potential improvements in weather forecasting services, as well as how the public values current forecast services.

6862907,"Study On Ecological Value Estimation Of Urban Park Green Space In Xian","In order to effectively enhance the service value of park green space and provide theoretical basis for assisting urban sustainable development. Based on Quick Bird high resolution remote sensing image data, as well as point cloud data measured in the sample, this paper describes the 3D green quantity, ecological service function and ecological value of the green space system in Xingqing Palace Park of Xi an city quantitatively, by differential method. The quantitative analysis method can be used for the scientific evaluation of urban green space ecosystem in northwest of China and other ecologically fragile areas, which can provide scientific basis for urban green space ecosystem planning and promote the sustainable development of urban and rural human settlement environment. The results show that Xi an Xingqing Palace Park has a high three-dimensional green quantity, it is 149 602. 856 m3. Besides, the order of ecological service function of xingqing Palace Park s green space system is as follows, carbon sequestration> oxygen release > dust retention> sulfur dioxide absorption. And the contribution rate of carbon sequestration benefit is the highest, which has obviously improved the urban ecological environment. Meanwhile, the total value of ecological service functions of carbon sequestration, oxygen release, dust retention and sulfur dioxide absorption in xingqing Palace Park reached 705 412. 466 yuan per year, with the value proportion of 77. 27 %, 0.08%, 3.97% and 18. 68 %, respectively. © 2023 Science Press.

6691694,"THE VALUE OF SHORT-RUN CLIMATE FORECASTS IN MANAGING THE COASTAL COHO SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS KISUTCH) FISHERY IN WASHINGTON STATE","In recent years our understanding of the intricate connections between climate variability, marine and freshwater environmental conditions and the responses of fish stocks has improved considerably. With predictable relationships between the environment and stock abundance, fishery managers should be able to forecast variation in stock survival and recruitment. Such forecasts present an opportunity for increasing the economic value of fisheries and for achieving other management objectives, such as stock conservation and maintenance of population diversity. After describing a 4-step framework for addressing the question ‘What is a forecast worth?’ in a fishery decision-making context, we introduce the management system for Washington's coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fishery. Then we apply the 4-step framework to estimate the value of improved run size forecasts in the annual harvest management of coho salmon in Washington State. Our principal analytical tool is a stochastic simulation model that incorporates the main characteristics of the fishery. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and constraints to the use of climate-based forecasts in fishery management on various spatial and temporal scales, and we consider the challenges associated with forecasting variations in fish stock size caused by shifts in climate and related ocean conditions.","{""Kaje, Janne""}","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-7445.2007.tb00210.x",2024-04-25 02:24:29,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2008,"{}",NA

CHRONOS can provide complete synoptic air pollution maps (""snapshots"") of the continental domain with less than 10 min of observations. This rapid mapping enables visualization of air pollution transport simultaneously across the entire continent and enables a sentinel-like capability for monitoring evolving, or unanticipated, air pollution sources in multiple locations at the same time with high temporal resolution. CHRONOS uses a compact imaging gas filter correlation radiometer for these observations, with heritage from more than 17 years of scientific data and algorithm advances by the science teams for the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft in low Earth orbit. To achieve continental-scale sub-hourly sampling, the CHRONOS mission would be conducted from geostationary orbit, with the instrument hosted on a communications or meteorological platform. CHRONOS observations would contribute to an integrated observing system for atmospheric composition using surface, suborbital and satellite data with atmospheric chemistry models, as defined by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites.

Identifying the forest roads that can be used after a disaster is very important for management of disasters such as fire, flood, and landslide as well as for strengthening of the forest road infrastructure. In this context, forest road extraction from orthophoto images has become a hot research topic in the field of remote sensing image analysis. Deep learning methods stand out in many fields that require remote sensing and these methods lead to very successful results compared with traditional methods. Recently, deep learning methods are applied frequently in road extraction. The aim of the present study was forest road network extraction from high resolution orthophoto images based on deep learning. Four different deep learning models have been used in the study which are AlexNet, ResNet-50, InceptionResNet-V2 and U-Net. First, the images in the dataset were subject to re-processing after which the deep learning models were trained separately. Secondly, values of overall accuracy, precision, recall, Dice coefficient, intersection over union, and test time were calculated for these trained network models over the validity dataset. Finally, the acquired results were compared and forest road segmentation inferences were visualized thus putting forth the accuracy at which the deep learning models used can extraction the forest roads.

6863306,"Gis-Based Environmental Database For Assessing The Mine Pollution: A Case Study Of An Abandoned Mine Site In Morocco","Morocco with important mining activities is increasingly concerned about impacts of mining on the environment. In Morocco, there are approximately 200 abandoned mine sites which vary from small scale underground mines to large scale open-pit mines. Some of these mines, with reactive tailings and waste rocks, are problematic. Indeed, Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) pollution from abandoned mines is responsible for soil and water contamination, land resources degradation, changes in landscapes, habitat destruction and human health hazards. In the current case study about the abandoned Kettara mine site, the impact of the old mining activity is assessed by the design and elaboration of an environmental database which will be supported by Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. This database includes multidisciplinary data related to geochemistry, hydrochemistry, hydrology, land cover, geology and climates. The current research demonstrated the efficiency of integrating multidisciplinary data and using GIS technologies when assessing the environmental impact of abandoned mines and forecasting how the pollution is occurred. The obtained results show that in addition to the soil, the surface water and groundwater of the Kettara mine are also contaminated by pollutants which were previously released from mine wastes by AMD action. The sulphate content and the Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the surface water and groundwater are high. The average values for surface water are: sulphate approximate to 7920 mg/L and EC approximate to 256851 mu S/cm. However, in groundwater they are: sulphate approximate to 2088 mg/L and EC approximate to 631 mu S/cm. These values exceed the guidelines for drinking water quality prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) 600 mg/L and 1500 mu S/cm for sulphate and EC respectively. The developed GIS based environmental database will serve as a reference study for other abandoned mine sites. Finally, it will be employed for the establishment of a web-based GIS Decision Support System which will assist decision makers in assessing and monitoring the occurred mine pollution.

6863328,"Assessment Of Soil Erosion Risk Using Rusle Model, Sateec System, Remote Sensing, And Gis Techniques: A Case Study Of Navroud Watershed","Soil erosion is a major environmental threat to soil health, natural resources, and sustainable agriculture. Appropriate knowledge of dynamic factors affecting soil erosion is crucial for effective decision-making in watershed management and soil conservation practice. The present study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of annual soil loss (SL) and sediment yield (SY) in the Navroud watershed from the years 2000 to 2018 using remotely-sensed data, GIS-integrated RUSLE Model, and the GIS-based SATEEEC model. For this purpose, models' factors including rainfall erosivity factor (R), crop management factor (C), soil erodibility factor (K), and topographic factor (LS) were prepared. In addition, to boost the performance of the models, the R factor was modified by applying the effect of the snowmelt-runoff erosivity factor (SR). Long-term suspended sediment load records were used to validate the models' results at the outlet of the watershed. RUSLE model showed that mean annual SL rates in the Navroud basin ranged from 0 to over 100 ton ha(-1) year(-1) with average values of 5.39 and 14.95 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and total rainfall-runoff erosivity (TR) factor as the sum of R and SR factors, respectively. However, for the SATEEC model, SL ranged from 0 to 144 and 0 to 461 with slightly higher average values of 6.2, and 16.76 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and TR factor, respectively. In general, the performance of the RUSLE and SATEEC models was low (R-2 = 0.39-0.44, NSE = - 0.05, 0.15) when the R factor was used as the only erosive factor in simulating SL. However, a notably better estimation of SL and SY was observed when the TR factor was used instead of the R factor (R-2 = 0.77-0.75, NSE = 0.33-0.36). It can be concluded that RUSLE showed slightly better results than SATEEC in the Navroud watershed, and also the use of the SR factor in calculating the erosive factor has led to a notable improvement in the models' simulation. In conclusion, these findings highlight not only the need to consider the SR factor in the models' simulation, especially in mountainous regions but these results can also assist in the implementation of effective conservation practices to reduce soil erosion risk in the Navroud watershed.","{""Asadi, Hossein"",""Bahrami, Hosseinali"",""Fallah, Mahboobeh""}","10.1007/s12665-023-11053-4",2024-07-18 21:08:29,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Soil loss; Snowmelt runoff; Sediment yield; Simulation""}"

However, the effects of multiple environmental factors can be complex to detect in ecosystems that offer a broad variety of microhabitats for a great variety of beetle species. This is the case in Patagonian temperate forests, where the use of remote sensing provides an opportunity to evaluate the sensitivity of beetle species to environmental changes. Here, we identified the environmental drivers of forest-dwelling beetle communities in the ground and canopy of 34 north Patagonian-forest landscapes. We analyzed the associations of the taxonomic and functional diversity of five trophic guilds with 30 remote-sensing variables of landscape structure, composition, and disturbances; vegetation and soil properties; and climate and physical variables. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify trophic guilds responding similarly to predictors. Segmented regression analysis was used to evaluate functional redundancy from taxonomic-functional richness relationships. A total of 583 species (23,848 individuals) of beetles were recorded for both strata. The effects of environmental variables were heterogeneous across strata and guilds. Canopy beetles were especially sensitive to early successional conditions, and canopy attributes, but also benefited from the canopy openness. Forest specialists of the ground and canopy responded differently to environmental variables. Ground-dwelling beetles were mostly affected by fires, human modifications, edge closeness, high temperatures, and soil properties, responding weakly to canopy properties.

Structural health assessment is the first pivotal step towards creating a strategy for long-term life-cycle management. Historical structures provide an abundance of unique challenges that when combined serve as a great qualifying test for the study of as-built structures. This paper explores the diagnostic value of terrestrial laser scanning for the structural health assessment of the Baptistery di San Giovanni in Florence, Italy and proposes an integrative methodology for repeatable data acquisition, processing, visualization and analysis. The presented study proves that even under challenging circumstances, efficient documentation of entire structures is possible. The case study at the Baptistery demonstrates that even when objectives are not formed prior to the survey, comprehensive data sets of high quality and reliability will enable meaningful structural health assessments.

To prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran. A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use, soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land use showed that 41\% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model's ability for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.","{""Balogun, Abdul-Lateef"",""Bera, Amit"",""Bhunia, Gouri Sankar"",""Chen, Wei"",""Chen, Yunzhi"",""Janizadeh, Saeid"",""Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh"",""Quoc Bao Pham"",""Wang, Xiaojing""}","10.1080/10106049.2021.1892212",2024-09-27 23:41:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Piping erosion; agriculture land use; machine learning; deep boosting; Zarandieh watershed""}"

6862789,"Globalized Poverty And Environment: 21st Century Challenges And Innovative Solutions","This book reviews the key conceptions and economic theories of poverty, explains poverty-environment nexus, and finally offers innovative socio-economic and scientific geospatial solutions for the 21st Century. The book makes it possible for our readers to understand poverty thorough a concise review of the major theoretical economic frameworks, measures of poverty, and points out the need to understand rural-urban dichotomy of poverty. We find the theories and measures to be less-than perfect and therefore point out the need to treat these measures and theories as convenient tools lacking perfect accuracy and utmost scientific reliability. It follows then that the supposedly knowledgeably crafted poverty reduction and environmental preservation solutions are inherently imperfect. The economic solutions proposed in this book transcend extant humdrum macroeconomic and policy measures targeting poverty and environmental issues. We point to a new paradigm in which private sector and other stakeholders can create new and inclusive markets where value is co-created and shared. Above all, this book offers timely state-of-the-art geospatial solutions targeting the most pressing global problems of water, e.g., the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions to estimate changes in stored water in the water-poverty-environment nexus, pollution, agriculture and disaster management, where geospatial techniques are applied under strong environmental impact assessment regulatory regimes. ""This book provides a good summary of economic theories of poverty as well as a vivid depiction of the state of environmental degradation in the world. People often work separately on different issues that are, in fact, closely intertwined. The principle of holism is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and I believe that this joint-venture of two experts on poverty and environment has produced something more than a sum of two separate monographs on the issues.

6863055,"Estimating Grassland Parameters From Sentinel-2: A Model Comparison Study","Grassland plays an important role in German agriculture. The interplay of ecological processes in grasslands secures important ecosystem functions and, thus, ultimately contributes to essential ecosystem services. To sustain, e.g., the provision of fodder or the filter function of soils, agricultural management needs to adapt to site-specific grassland characteristics. Spatially explicit information derived from remote sensing data has been proven instrumental for achieving this. In this study, we analyze the potential of Sentinel-2 data for deriving grassland-relevant parameters. We compare two well-established methods to calculate the aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), first using a random forest regression and second using the soil–leaf-canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model. Field data were recorded on a grassland area in Brandenburg in August 2019, and were used to train the empirical model and to validate both models. Results confirm that both methods are suitable for mapping the spatial distribution of LAI and for quantifying aboveground biomass. Uncertainties generally increased with higher biomass and LAI values in the empirical model and varied on average by a relative RMSE of 11% for modeling of dry biomass and a relative RMSE of 23% for LAI. Similar estimates were achieved using SLC with a relative RMSE of 30% for LAI retrieval, and a relative RMSE of 47% for the estimation of dry biomass. Resulting maps from both approaches showed comprehensible spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass distributions. Despite variations in the value ranges of both maps, the average estimates and spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass were very similar. Based on the results of the two compared modeling approaches and the comparison to the validation data, we conclude that the relationship between Sentinel-2 spectra and grassland-relevant variables can be quantified to map their spatial distributions from space. Future research needs to investigate how similar approaches perform across different grassland types, seasons and grassland management regimes. © 2020, The Author(s).","{""Bach, H."",""Bartsch, J."",""Buddeberg, M."",""Hostert, P."",""Kowalski, K."",""Pfoch, K."",""Pickert, J."",""Schwieder, M.""}","10.1007/s41064-020-00120-1",2024-07-17 19:45:11,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{calibration}","{""Brandenburg [Germany]"",""Empirical model"",Germany,""Grassland biomass"",""Leaf area index"",Sentinel,Sentinel-2,""Soil–leaf-canopy radiative transfer model"",""aboveground biomass"",canopy,""empirical analysis"",grassland,""numerical model"",""radiative transfer"",""remote sensing""}"

This paper outlines prerequisites to beneficial forecast use; highlights key issues, approaches and challenges related to each; and suggests an evolutionary strategy. The first prerequisite is that forecast information must address a need that is both real and perceived. Second, benefit arises only through viable decision options that are sensitive to forecast information. Third, benefit depends on prediction of the components of climate variability that are relevant to viable decisions. Fourth, appropriate forecast use requires effective communication of relevant information. Finally, sustained use requires institutional commitment and favorable policies. It is useful to consider three phases of effort: an exploratory phase to gain understanding and assess potential, a pilot phase characterized by co-learning between researchers and target decision makers, and an operational phase focusing on engaging and equipping relevant institutions. Although examples of use and potential use, and advances in institutional support, are cause for optimism, use of climate prediction by agriculture is still too new to support strong generalizations about its value.","{""Hansen, James""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00043-4",2024-04-26 18:54:23,"excluded","{""Value is not measured""}",2002,"{}","{""Climate forecasts|Decision making|Research strategy|El Nino-Souther Oscillation""}"

The results of the comprehensive soil erosion improvement in the sub-basin are used to give an evaluation of the effectiveness of the gully slope vegetation restoration project. Soil erosion quantification distribution in the Sheep Sap Gully sub-basin of the Loess Plateau hilly gully area was simulated and explored by combining the modified universal soil loss equation RUSLE model with GIS and RS spatial information technology. The quantitative values of LS factor were extracted using DEM data, the R factor of rainfall erosion force was calculated using meteorological monitoring station data around this region, the K factor of erosion resistance was obtained based on the soil survey database, and the C factor and P factor of soil and water conservation measures were obtained by combining MODIS image data and previous research experience. The study concluded that (1) The erosion area ratio within the study area is 36.33\%; (2) The quantitative grading standard of the pattern, the size of the erosion distribution area at all levels is ranked as light>moderate>very strong>strong>intense; (3) Under the conditions of land use and vegetation cover, strong erosion is mostly found in farming areas with sparse vegetation, while weak erosion is found in areas with lush vegetation such as forests and grasslands; (4) In terms of spatial distribution, erosion is greater in the south-western part of the basin than in the north-eastern part, and there is also strong erosion in the south-western part. The results of the study provide a reference for research into integration and synthesis of ecological security technologies for gully and slope management projects.

6862980,"Quantitative Estimation Of Soil Salinity Using Uav-Borne Hyperspectral And Satellite Multispectral Images","Soil salinization is a global issue resulting in soil degradation, arable land loss and ecological environmental deterioration. Over the decades, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing have enabled efficient and cost-effective monitoring of salt-affected soils. However, the potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate and map soil salinity has not been thoroughly explored. This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0 similar to 20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin's concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the soil salinity of three study fields with different land cover were mapped. The results showed that bare land (field A) exhibited the most severe salinity, followed by dense vegetation area (field C) and sparse vegetation area (field B). The predictive models using UAV data outperformed those derived from GF-2 data with lower RMSE, higher CC and RPD values, and the most accurate UAV-derived model was developed using 62 hyperspectral bands of the image of the field A with the RMSE, CC, and RPD values of 1.40 dS m(-1), 0.94, and 2.98, respectively. Our results indicated that UAV-borne hyperspectral imager is a useful tool for field-scale soil salinity monitoring and mapping.

The rainfall-runoff model HBV was used to simulate streamflow in the two catchments using (1) observed rain gauge data; (2) the original GPDs and (3) the bias-corrected GPDs as input. Results showed that applying QM to bias correction based on limited observed data tends to aggravate streamflow simulations relative to not bias correcting GPDs. This is likely due to a potential lack of representativeness of a single rain gauge observation at the scale of a hydrological catchment for these catchments. The results also indicate that there may be potential benefits in combining streamflow and rain gauge data to bias correct GPDs during the model calibration process within a hydrological modeling framework.",NA,"10.3390/atmos8120246",2024-10-03 22:30:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863386,"Characterizing Spatial Patterns Of Invasive Species Using Sub-Pixel Classifications","Invasive species disrupt landscape patterns and compromise the functionality of ecosystem processes. Non-native saltcedar poses significant threats to native vegetation and groundwater resources in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, and quantifying spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for monitoring its spread. Considerable research focuses on determining the accuracy of various remote sensing techniques for distinguishing saltcedar from native woody riparian vegetation through sub-pixel, or soft classifications. However, there is a lack of research quantifying spatial distribution patterns from these classifications, mainly because landscape metrics, which are commonly used to statistically assess these patterns, require bounded classes and cannot be applied directly to soft classifications. This study tests a new method for discretizing sub-pixel data to generate landscape metrics using a continuum of fractional cover thresholds. The developed approach transforms sub-pixel classifications into discrete maps compliant with metric terms and computes and interprets metric results in the context of the region to explain patterns in the extent, distribution, and connectivity of saltcedar in the Rio Grande basin. Results indicate that landscape metrics are sensitive to sub-pixel values and can vary greatly with fractional cover. Therefore spectral unmixing should be performed prior to metric calculations. Analysis of metric trends provides evidence that saltcedar has expanded away from the immediate riparian zones and is displacing native vegetation. This information, coupled with control management strategies, can be used to target remediation activities along the Rio Grande. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","{""Frazier, A.

An analysis of LULC is made for the Baghmundi Community Development (C.D.) Block of Purulia district of West Bengal, India to observe the changes over time. The Landsat images of 1972, 1992, 1999, 2009 and 2019 are taken to prepare the LULC maps using RS and GIS techniques. Moreover, the Markov chain model is computed to estimate LULC change of 2039. Thematic maps of different years show several changes in LULC. An accuracy assessment of the classifications of LULC of the years 1999, 2009 and 2019 is calculated as 81.32\%, 81.36\% and 80.16\% respectively. The kappa coefficient is also computed for the same years to understand the level of agreement between classified LULC type and ground level LULC type. The values of kappa coefficient are 0.76 for 1999, 0.77 for 2009 and 0.75 for 2019. Within the time frame of 1972 to 2019, the vegetation cover declined to 44.79 km(2), while the built-up area increased to 40.21 km(2). Based on the predicted model, the vegetation cover may lose 33.60 km(2) in 2039 from the year 2019, and it may mainly be acquired by the agricultural land (21.94 km(2)) and built-up area (7.93 km(2)).","{""Banerjee, Monali"",""Ghosh, Debasis"",""Karmakar, Manas"",""Mandal, Mrinal""}","10.1007/s12518-020-00345-0",2024-07-19 23:41:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{calibration}","{GIS,""Markov chain; Baghmundi; LULC; Rate of change; RS""}"

6863103,"Effects Of Building Density On Land Surface Temperature In China: Spatial Patterns And Determinants","The effects of building density on land surface temperature (LST) and its spatial patterns remain poorly understood over large areas. Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, we quantified the effects of building density on land surface temperature (K) across 21 cities in China and analysed their spatial patterns, possible factors, and mechanisms. Results showed that the effects of building density on LST were more significant in areas with dry climates compared to humid climates. The spatial variability in the effects of building density on LST was closely related to climate conditions, soil type, and vegetation. The results from stepwise regression analysis showed that precipitation (climate) controlled the spatial variability, indicating that there is a complex mechanism underlying these potential factors. Furthermore, the results from climatic zoning statistics revealed that the K-values of northern Chinese cities were positively correlated with the areas of local water bodies. However, the K-values of southern Chinese cities were significantly and positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity and were negatively correlated with population density. Stepwise regression results further indicated that the mean annual temperature may be the most influential factor for southern cities. These results highlight the spatial variance and different determinants of K and suggest that climate-adapted urban design and planning standards are needed in different climate zones.","{""Chen, Wei"",""Hou, Boyan"",""Huang, Ke"",""Prishchepov, V, Alexander"",""Song, Jinchao"",""Zhang, Jianjun""}","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103794",2024-09-27 23:33:14,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Land surface temperature; Building density; Climate zone; Urban planning; Remote sensing""}"

It has numerous applications in a variety of fields, including military surveillance, geological exploration, disaster management, and mapping of natural phenomena like climate change, forest management, and volcanic eruptions. The image acquired by coherent sensors such as SAR is corrupted by granular multiplicative noise, also known as speckle. It has an adverse influence on the visual interpretation of SAR images and prevents the use of various post-processing tasks. Despeckling addresses the removal of such noise from SAR images while preserving the image details. This work provides a brief summary of the theory, applications, speckle statistics, performance measures, and recent developments in despeckling filters using variational methods for SAR images.

6862977,"Land Use Changes From Unconventional Gas Development In Public Lands Of The Fayetteville Shale","Changes in drilling practices in the oil and gas industry have opened new regions to energy development across much of the United States, including areas that have large holdings of public lands of high conservation value. Using satellite images and GIS techniques, we measured public land use changes in the Fayetteville Shale, a region in north-central Arkansas that has undergone rapid natural gas development in the last 10 years. These public lands showed less development of gas infrastructure compared to the larger gas field, which is mostly privately owned. Gas activities led to less natural forest loss and edge habitat creation in public lands compared to private lands. However, one large public land property (Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area) showed much more development compared to the overall gas field (about 20\% higher). This disparity was most likely due to differences in regulation and controversial leases that were allowed for this wildlife management area early in the Fayetteville Shale development. These results show that natural gas development can occur around public lands of high conservation value without large land use and habitat impacts, but we suggest such an outcome relies upon effective management practices and wise decision-making by public officials. In the case of Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area, strategic well-pad and pipeline placement could have substantially reduced impact to natural areas.","{""Cox, A.

6863396,"Quantifying The Sensitivity Of Ephemeral Streams To Land Disturbance Activities In Arid Ecosystems At The Watershed Scale","Large areas of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and located in arid regions of the southwestern United States are being considered for the development of utility-scale solar energy facilities. Land-disturbing activities in these desert, alluvium-filled valleys have the potential to adversely affect the hydrologic and ecologic functions of ephemeral streams. Regulation and management of ephemeral streams typically falls under a spectrum of federal, state, and local programs, but scientifically based guidelines for protecting ephemeral streams with respect to land-development activities are largely nonexistent. This study developed an assessment approach for quantifying the sensitivity to land disturbance of ephemeral stream reaches located in proposed solar energy zones (SEZs). The ephemeral stream assessment approach used publicly-available geospatial data on hydrology, topography, surficial geology, and soil characteristics, as well as high-resolution aerial imagery. These datasets were used to inform a professional judgment-based score index of potential land disturbance impacts on selected critical functions of ephemeral streams, including flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitat value, and groundwater recharge. The total sensitivity scores (sum of scores for the critical stream functions of flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitats, and groundwater recharge) were used to identify highly sensitive stream reaches to inform decisions on developable areas in SEZs. Total sensitivity scores typically reflected the scores of the individual stream functions; some exceptions pertain to groundwater recharge and ecological habitats. The primary limitations of this assessment approach were the lack of high-resolution identification of ephemeral stream channels in the existing National Hydrography Dataset, and the lack of mechanistic processes describing potential impacts on ephemeral stream functions at the watershed scale. The primary strength of this assessment approach is that it allows watershed-scale planning for low-impact development in arid ecosystems; the qualitative scoring of potential impacts can also be adjusted to accommodate new geospatial data, and to allow for expert and stakeholder input into decisions regarding the identification and potential avoidance of highly sensitive stream reaches. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","{""Bowen, E.

6863470,"Accuracy Assessment Of National Land Cover Database Shrubland Products On The Sagebrush Steppe Fringe","Remotely sensed data products depicting physical and ecological attributes of a landscape are becoming invaluable tools in wildlife and rangeland management. However, if such geospatial tools and data layers are to be used in management, their accuracy and appropriateness for such use needs to be vetted and validated. We assessed accuracy of two National Land Cover Database (NLCD) shrubland products for use in western South Dakota—percent sagebrush and sagebrush height—by comparing them to ground-truthed data. Western South Dakota sagebrush communities are an ecotone between sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and grassland. This ecotone is typified by shorter- and lower-density sagebrush than interior sagebrush steppe ecosystem. This distinction could make it difficult to remotely detect and map sagebrush in this area. We determined NLCD correlations with ground estimates of sagebrush canopy cover (r = 0.17) and sagebrush height (r = 0.40). The NLCD percent sagebrush accurately predicted sagebrush presence ∼73‒76% of the time once resampled to 100-m pixels and 50-m mean values, respectively. Cohen's kappa values were estimated to determine if the ground-truthed and remoted-sensed data were in agreement when determining sagebrush presence. Kappa values were 0.26 ± 0.06 and 0.28 ± 0.06 for mean values within 50-m and resampled 100-m pixels, respectively, indicating a “fair” level of agreement between the ground-truthed and remote-sensed data types when determining presence of sagebrush. The NLCD data sufficiently described the presence of sagebrush in South Dakota, which is useful for estimating geographic distributions of sagebrush obligate species, species distribution models in which presence or absence of sagebrush is of interest, or mapping the occurrence of sagebrush in South Dakota. Inaccuracies of the NLCD shrubland products in predicting sagebrush height and sagebrush canopy cover may limit their utility as continuous variables in species distribution models, habitat selection, and suitability models or when assessing rangeland quality in South Dakota. © 2019 The Society for Range Management","{""Gregory, A.

6862878,"Advances In Large-Scale Flood Monitoring And Detection","The last decades have seen a massive advance in technologies for Earth observation (EO) and environmental monitoring, which provided scientists and engineers with valuable spatial information for studying hydrologic processes. At the same time, the power of computers and newly developed algorithms have grown sharply. Such advances have extended the range of possibilities for hydrologists, who are trying to exploit these potentials the most, updating and re-inventing the way hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are carried out. A variety of research fields have progressed significantly, ranging from the evaluation of water features, to the classification of land-cover, the identification of river morphology, and the monitoring of extreme flood events. The description of flood processes may particularly benefit from the integrated use of recent algorithms and monitoring techniques. In fact, flood exposure and risk over large areas and in scarce data environments have always been challenging topics due to the limited information available on river basin hydrology, basin morphology, land cover, and the resulting model uncertainty. The ability of new tools to carry out intensive analyses over huge datasets allows us to produce flood studies over large extents and with a growing level of detail. The present Special Issue aims to describe the state-of-the-art on flood assessment, monitoring, and management using new algorithms, new measurement systems and EO data. More specifically, we collected a number of contributions dealing with: (1) the impact of climate change on floods; (2) real time flood forecasting systems; (3) applications of EO data for hazard, vulnerability, risk mapping, and post-disaster recovery phase; and (4) development of tools and platforms for assessment and validation of hazard/risk models.","{""Manfreda, Salvatore"",""Nardi, Fernando"",""Refice, Alberto"",""Samela, Caterina"",""Tramutoli, Valerio""}","10.3390/hydrology5030049",2024-07-19 21:15:37,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",2018,"{""intro to special issue""}","{""hydroinformatics; flood mapping; flood monitoring; floodplains; rivers dynamics; DEM-based methods; ""}"
6862876,"Multi-Structure Joint Decision-Making Approach For Land Use Classification Of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Cnns","Land use classification of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images is a challenging and prominent problem in which pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made amazing achievements. However, single-structured pretrained CNNs have limitations to obtain high classification accuracy. Besides, each pretrained CNNs has different classification ability to classify land use. Therefore, taking advantages of different pretrained CNNs is essential for land use classification. In this study, we propose a novel classification approach based on multi-structure joint decision-making strategy and pretrained CNNs. The basic idea is to apply three CNNs to classify land use separately with the final classification results achieved by joint decision-making strategy. The proposed approach comprises of three steps. First, we create a new fully connected layer and Softmax classification layer. We combine them with the convolutional layers of AlexNet, Inception-v3, and ResNet18. AlexNet also includes the first two layers of fully connected layers. Secondly, we train these designed CNNs to converge by momentum-driven stochastic gradient descent. Thirdly, we utilize joint decision-making strategy to obtain the final prediction results by combining the prediction results of these designed CNNs. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the UC Merced land use, AID, NWPU-45, OPTIMAL-31 datasets and further compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. The benefits of the proposed approach are threefold. First, the multi-structure network maximizes different pretrained CNN structures to extract rich convolution features. Secondly, it could remarkably improve the classification accuracy of indistinguishable land use types of the HRRS images. Thirdly, it has great potential on small dataset with more land use types. The proposed CNN based on multi-structure joint decision approach achieves accurate and reliable land use classification with these benefits. © 2013 IEEE.","{""Chen, Y."",""Gao, A."",""Pan, J."",""Xu, L.""}","10.1109/access.2020.2976484",2024-07-16 23:19:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{""algorithm is valued""}","{""Classification accuracy"",""Classification approach"",Convolution,""Convolutional neural network"",""Convolutional neural networks"",""Decision making"",""Gradient methods"",""High resolution remote sensing"",""High resolution remote sensing images"",""High-resolution remote sensing images"",""Image classification"",""Image enhancement"",""Land use"",""Land use classification"",""Landuse classifications"",Multi-structure,""Remote sensing"",""State-of-the-art methods"",""Stochastic gradient descent"",""Stochastic systems"",""Transfer learning""}"
6863427,"A Novel Haze Removal Computing Architecture For Remote Sensing Images Using Multi-Scale Retinex Technique","One of the major degradation arise in the satellite images is poor weather conditions (i.e., haze). Haze is an environmental distortion which significantly affect and minimize the efficiency of remote sensing image interpretation. To tackle this complication, this research work introduced a new approach named as multi-scale retinex histogram equalization with U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal (MSRHE with U-Net DOPT) scheme. In this scheme, multi-scale retinex technique is applied to eliminate ambient atmospheric light value of inhomogeneous information and retain only object surface reflection but they suffer from dark tone. So, of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is employed to brighten the image tone with limited contrast level. Then the enhanced image is restored using U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal technique which deeply extract the feature information with dragonfly optimized ReLU activation unit to enhance the system efficiency. This resolved criteria can greatly improve the image efficiency to generate haze-free image. At the same time, the techniques such as dark channel prior (DCP) method, urban remote sensing haze removal (URSHR) method were employed to comparatively analysed with MSRHE with U-Net DOPT. Three parameters such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity (FSIM) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed to quantitatively estimate the test (query) result.

6863040,"An Iot System And Modis Images Enable Smart Environmental Management For Mekong Delta","The smart environmental management system proposed in this work offers a new approach to environmental monitoring by utilizing data from IoT stations and MODIS satellite imagery. The system is designed to be deployed in vast regions, such as the Mekong Delta, with low building and operating costs, making it a cost-effective solution for environmental monitoring. The system leverages telemetry data collected by IoT stations in combination with MODIS MOD09GA, MOD11A1, and MCD19A2 daily image products to develop computational models that calculate the values land surface temperature (LST), 2.5 and 10 (mu m) particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10) in areas without IoT stations. The MOD09GA product provides land surface spectral reflectance from visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths to determine land cover types. The MOD11A1 product provides thermal infrared emission from the land surface to compute LST. The MCD19A2 product provides aerosol optical depth values to detect the presence of atmospheric aerosols, e.g., PM2.5 and PM10. The collected data, including remote sensing images and telemetry sensor data, are preprocessed to eliminate redundancy and stored in cloud storage services for further processing. This allows for automatic retrieval and computation of the data by the smart data processing engine, which is designed to process various data types including images and videos from cameras and drones. The calculated values are then made available through a graphic user interface (GUI) that can be accessed through both desktop and mobile devices. The GUI provides real-time visualization of the monitoring values, as well as alerts to administrators based on predetermined rules and values of the data. This allows administrators to easily monitor the system, configure the system by setting alerting rules or calibrating the ground stations, and take appropriate action in response to alerts. Experimental results from the implementation of the system in Dong Thap Province in the Mekong Delta show that the linear regression models for PM2.5 and PM10 estimations from MCD19A2 AOD values have correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.68, and RMSEs of 4.11 and 5.74 mu g/m(3), respectively. Computed LST values from MOD09GA and MOD11A1 reflectance and emission data have a correlation coefficient of 0.82 with ground measurements of air temperature. These errors are comparable to other models reported in similar regions in the literature, demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system.","{""Pham, Danh Phan Hong"",""Pham, Tran Vu"",""Pham-Quoc, Cuong"",""Phan, Vu Hien"",""Qureshi, Kashif Naseer""}","10.3390/fi15070245",2024-07-15 22:57:55,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""IoT stations; remote sensing images; smart environmental management""}"
6903633,"Potential Drivers Of Common Brusntail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Decline On A Murray River Floodplain","Australia's terrestrial mammalian fauna have experienced severe declines since European settlement. On the Murray-Darling floodplain in south-eastern Australia, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, 'possums'), have contracted to riparian zones. Although an important possum refuge, little is known about possum population dynamics here. We examined possum population dynamics and potential drivers across two decades on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station. We related possum density to satellite derived fractional cover, (a measure of the proportion of green, non-green and bare ground cover), and contextualised these findings using tree condition and grazing pressure datasets. Possum surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2019 in riparian and non-riparian habitats and density was modelled in relation to fractional cover values of green, non-green, and bare ground. Possum density fluctuated between 1998 and 2008 but in 2018 and 2019, possums were undetectable. Possum density was negatively associated with bare ground and positively associated with non-green. Overgrazing by kangaroos likely reduced vegetation cover and diversity and contributed to possum decline, via a reduction in possum food resources and increased exposure to predation. Inconsistent monitoring meant that the population decline was not detected until after it had occurred, and management interventions were not triggered, highlighting the dilemma of allocating scarce monitoring resources.",NA,"10.1071/am22004",2024-10-03 21:56:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

This study, in analyzing the main issues in the planning domain, proposes that roof greening as a complementation can be integrated into urban green systems, and aims to construct an eco-space network in a high-density city area with a deteriorated ecological environment and shortage of land resources. The present study uses Xiamen Island as the research area, and utilizes geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing technology to establish the status of the area and plan the space database by using remote sensing data, field surveys, questionnaires, departmental data, and planning texts. From the three aspects of existing research combing, comprehensive benefits, and urban development appeal analysis, this study summarized the impact factors of roof greening implementation potential, integrated planning divisions, and building classifications to establish a method of assessing implementation potential; we assessed the potential of roof greening implementation in the study area, and achieved eco-space network planning combined with urban green-space systems by taking ""global space, key areas, and multidimensional networks"" into consideration. The results indicated that 1) ecological structure, urban function optimization, public service demand, environmental improvement demand, architectural characteristics, and architectural property ownership as the evaluation elements of potential for roof greening implementation, including the urban ecological framework, urban functional structure, landscape upgrade demand, building renovation demand, urban internality degree, heat island intensity, microclimate environment, building height, building age, building type, and architectural property attributes as key evaluation factors. 2) In 2016, the roof greening rate of buildings on Xiamen Island was only 2%, with more than half attached to residential buildings and urban villages. Commercial, public, and industrial buildings had a lot of potential space for roof greening, and among the remaining buildings, 81.3% were suitable for roof greening. 3) The first step of the study was to explore the method of planning the eco-space network in the high-density urban area. Next, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and GIS, we aimed to build a research method for optimizing an eco-space network with multiple functions, in order to prevent the urban environmental damage and ecological disaster caused by high-intensity development and high-risk agglomeration. © 2018 Science Press.

We visually interpreted the combination of bands 5 (Near Infrared (NIR), with wavelengths of 0.85 - 0.88 μm), 6 (Short Wave Infrared 1 (SWIR 1), with wavelengths of 1.57 - 1.65 μm) and 2 (Blue, with wavelengths of 0.45 - 0.51 μm) to obtain the map of palm swamp forest with an interpretation scale of 1:100 000 and a minimum mapping area of 5.00 ha. We determined a coverage of 65 120.04 ha of palm swamp forest in the Ucayali region. Identifying the location and net area of palm swamp forests in the Ucayali region will allow further understanding of their potential benefits, management and utilization of fruits, environmental services and also information for better management in the context of climate change. © 2020 Institute of Investigations of The Peruvian Amazon - IIAP.

6863521,"Development Of A Telemetry And Yield-Mapping System Of Olive Harvester","Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study, three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards. A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters. The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system. The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in alley width for SHD olive harvester. A yield map was plotted using data that were acquired by a yield monitor, reflecting the yield gradient in spite of the larger differences between tree yields.","{""Agueera, Juan"",""Blanco-Roldan, Gregorio L."",""Castillo-Ruiz, Francisco J."",""Gil-Ribes, Jesus A."",""Perez-Ruiz, Manuel""}","10.3390/s150204001",2024-10-03 17:45:09,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2015,"{}",NA
6862905,"Spatiotemporal Variations In Drought And Vegetation Response In Inner Mongolia From 1982 To 2019","Drought events cause ecological problems, including reduced water resources and degraded vegetation. Quantifying vegetation responses to drought is essential for ecological management. However, in existing research, the response relationships (correlations and lags) were typically determined based on Pearson correlation coefficient and the resultant lag times were constrained by the spatial and temporal resolutions of the analyzed data. Inner Mongolia is an important ecological barrier in northern China. Ecological security is one of the most concerned issues of the region's sustainable development. Herein, we combined Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g) with Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terra-vegetation (SPOT-VGT) NDVI data through spatial downscaling. The obtained 1 km-resolution NDVI dataset spanning Inner Mongolia from 1982 to 2019 was used to represent the refined vegetation distribution. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) derived from gridded meteorological data was used to measure drought over the same period. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation and drought in the region in the past 38 years. We then discussed changes in different vegetation responses to drought across eastern Inner Mongolia using cross wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC). The results reveal that in 82.4\% of the study area, NDVI exhibited rising trends, and the SPEI values exhibited declining trends in 78.5\% of the area. In eastern Inner Mongolia, the grassland NDVI was positively correlated with SPEI and significantly affected by drought events, while NDVI in forestlands, including shrubs, broad-leaved forests, and coniferous forests, was negatively correlated with SPEI in the short term and weakly affected by drought. The NDVI lag times behind SPEI in grasslands, coniferous forests, and broad-leaved forests were 1-1.5, 4.5, and 7-7.5 months, respectively. These findings provide a scientific foundation for environmental preservation in the region.","{""Cao, Xinyu"",""Chen, Yun"",""Wei, Yujiao"",""Yu, Huilin"",""Zhu, Lin""}","10.3390/rs14153803",2024-09-30 01:36:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""NDVI; SPEI; drought; spatiotemporal characteristics; response relationships""}"
6863021,"Identifying Trends In Land Degradation In Non-Equilibrium Rangelands","1. Change in environmental conditions in the complex non-equilibrium rangelands of arid Australia is difficult to monitor. We show how trends in rangeland condition can be identified from changes over time in the pattern of vegetation growth across gradients of differing grazing intensity. 2. Grazing intensity was measured indirectly using distance from water. Vegetation growth was derived from remotely sensed vegetation index values before and after large rainfalls, The amount of growth was adjusted for initial vegetation cover to give a standard measure of vegetation response. 3. A vegetation response ratio was derived by comparing areas less than 4 km from water with benchmark areas further away. Systematic changes in this ratio over time indicate a trend. 4. Ratio values from test areas suggested decline, improvement and no change, consistent with recent management history. 5. The method can be applied where the whole area is affected by grazing and relatively pristine benchmarks are unavailable. It could therefore be useful in the semi-arid rangelands where paddocks are smaller than in the arid part of Australia. It also has possible uses in the rangelands of Africa and the Americas. There is potential for applying the method to traditional grazing systems as well as to commercial pastoralism. 6. The method is cheaper and more effective than other techniques and increases the capacity of grazing gradient-based monitoring schemes for arid and semi-arid areas.","{""Bastin, GN"",""Chewings, VH"",""Pickup, G""}","10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.00319.x",2024-07-19 21:14:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",1998,"{}","{""environmental trend; grazing gradients; monitoring; non-equilibrium rangelands; remote sensing""}"
6862982,"Impacts Of Socioeconomic Factors On Cropland Transition And Its Adaptation In Beijing, China","Over the past decades, croplands in China experienced rapid losses as a result of nationwide urbanization, industrialization, socioeconomic development, and implementation of ecological projects. These developments were driven by continuous economic reforms and environmental protection policies. Croplands are precious land resources influenced by overpopulation in China. Cropland losses threaten national food security. This study analyzed spatial patterns of cropland changes, driving forces, and its adaptation. Object-based approach was adopted to accurately measure cropland changes using remote sensing data. Conversion matrix and statistical regression model were used to explore impacts of socioeconomic factors on cropland changes. A case study on Beijing revealed that cropland in Beijing decreased by 47% in the past 35 years. Primary driving forces in cropland loss included urban expansion, implementation of ecological projects, orchard plantation, and water resource protection. Increased migration and economic development resulted in urban expansion. To promote sustainable development and to meet demands of urban and environmental protection, cropland adaptation was performed by increasing value-added commercial crop plantation, improving crop yield, and reducing cultivation intensity for effective water consumption. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","{""Li, Q."",""Lu, D."",""Lu, S."",""Zhang, L.""}","10.1007/s12665-018-7740-8",2024-07-13 00:04:46,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{Adaptation,""Beijing [China]"",China,""Cropland transition"",Crops,""Data handling"",Ecology,Economic,""Environmental protection"",Expansion,""Food supply"",Rain,""Regression analysis"",""Remote sensing"",""Socio-economic development"",""Socio-economic factor"",""Socio-economic impacts"",""Socioeconomic impacts"",""Statistical regression model"",""Sustainable development"",""Urban expansion"",""Water resource protection"",""Water resources"",""adaptive management"",""agricultural land"",""economic development"",""environmental impact assessment"",""food security"",""range expansion"",""reform process"",""social effects"",""socioeconomic impact""}"
6863320,"Siamixformer: A Fully-Transformer Siamese Network With Temporal Fusion For Accurate Building Detection And Change Detection In Bi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images","Building detection and change detection using remote sensing images can help urban and rescue planning. Moreover, they can be used for building damage assessment after natural disasters. Currently, most of the existing models for building detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings. This is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's performance because of the presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we propose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster images as input. Our model has two encoders and has a hierarchical transformer architecture. The output of each stage in both encoders is given to a temporal transformer for feature fusion in a way that query is generated from pre-disaster images and (key, value) is generated from post-disaster images. To this end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another advantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can better maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders compared with CNNs. Finally, the output of the temporal transformer is given to a simple MLP decoder at each stage. The SiamixFormer model is evaluated on xBD, and WHU datasets, for building detection and on LEVIR-CD and CDD datasets for change detection and could outperform the state-of-the-art.","{""Ghaderi, Foad"",""Mohammadian, Amir""}","10.1080/01431161.2023.2225228",2024-07-16 23:52:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{""algorithm is valued""}","{""Building detection; change detection; Siamese transformer; remote sensing images""}"
6903477,"Unsupervised Bayesian Inference To Fuse Biosignal Sensory Estimates For Personalizing Care","The role of sensing technologies, such as wearables, in delivering precision care is becoming widely acceptable. Given the very large quantities of sensor data that rapidly accumulate, there is a need to employ automated algorithms to label biosignal sensor data. In many real-life clinical applications, no such expert labels are available, and algorithms for processing sensor data must be relied upon, without access to the 'ground truth.' It is therefore extremely difficult to choose which algorithms to trust or discard at any point in time, where different algorithms may be optimal for different patients, or even for different points in time for the same patient. We propose two fully Bayesian approaches for fusing labels from independent and potentially correlated annotators (i.e., algorithms or, where available, experts). These are generative models to aggregate labels (i.e., the outputs of the algorithms, such as identified ECG morphology) in an unsupervised manner, to estimate jointly the assumed bias and precision of each algorithm without access to the ground truth. The latter fused estimate may then be used to infer the underlying ground truth. For the first time in the biomedical context, we show that modeling correlations between annotators, and fusing information concerning task difficulty (such as the estimated quality of the sensor data), improve these estimates with respect to commonly employed strategies in the literature. Also, we adopt a strongly Bayesian approach to inference using Gibbs sampling to improve estimates over the existing state of the art. We present results from applying the proposed pair of models to simulated and two publicly available biomedical datasets, to demonstrate proof-of-principle. We show that our proposed models outperform all existing approaches recreated from the literature. We also show that the proposed methods are robust when dealing with missing values (as often occurs in real-life biomedical applications), and that they are suitably efficient for use in real-Time applications, thereby providing the basis for the reliable use of sensors for personalizing the care of the individual. © 2013 IEEE.",NA,"10.1109/jbhi.2018.2820054",2024-10-03 22:22:16,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6903484,"Regional Distribution Of Salt-Rich Dust Across Southwest Asia Based On Predictive Soil-Geomorphic Mapping Techniques","Understanding the source regions of soluble salt-rich dust is critical for military operations, monitoring potential environmental health impacts to military personnel, and for mitigating abrasion and corrosion to military materiél operating in desert regions. Arid regions are characterized by saline soils which are formed by a lack of precipitation and influenced by surrounding and underlying geology, among other factors. The dust content in soils and surface sediments in southwest Asia is commonly associated with specific landforms. This paper uses a soil-geomorphic conceptual model that integrates geographic datasets of Landsat imagery, soil and landforms, precipitation data, and geologic maps to produce derivative map-based predictions of the spatial distribution and content of salt-rich dust-sized particle in soils and surface sediments in the region. The derivative map is based on three regional dust and salt content maps and the assignment of a five-fold rating class and numerical factor value system to individual map polygons [e.g., Very High (5), High (4), Moderate (3), Low (2), Very Low (1)]. The three regional maps include: (1) dust content based on the identification of distinct landform assemblages from 15-m resolution compressed LANDSAT TM+ imagery at a scale of 1:750,000, (2) salt content developed from 1 km 2 -resolution mean annual precipitation data, and (3) geologic-based salt content developed from published geologic maps. This study presents an initial step towards the prediction of salt-rich dust sources at regional scales that is aimed to provide information to planning military operations and for mitigating the hazards of dust on military personnel and equipment operating in desert regions. The approach used to predict dust and salt sources could also be used to refine atmospheric dust loading models that require knowledge of the spatial distribution of geomorphic-based input parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA,"10.1007/978-1-4939-3429-4_16",2024-09-30 16:53:58,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863172,"Estimating The Economic Value And Economic Return Of Irrigation Water As A Sustainable Water Resource Management Mechanism","Estimating the economic value of irrigation water in monetary terms is a crucial water management tool to address water scarcity, shortage, and overuse problems. This study seeks to couple remote-sensing-based, biophysical water productivity with empirical economic valuation of water to estimate irrigation water's near real-time economic value and the gross return that farmers can earn from using the irrigation water. The study was done at the Koga large-scale community-managed irrigation scheme in the Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Water productivity based on open sources remotely sensed data (WaPOR) datasets and Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) were used to analyze near real-time crop water productivity (CWP), and determine irrigation water's economic value. Results showed that the average CWP was 1.08 kg/m(3). Farmers were willing to pay 0.074 US\$/m(3), which ranged from 7.5 to 23.5\% of their gross benefit from irrigation water. The study evidenced that coupling the remote-sensing-based CWP data with an empirical analysis of farmers' willingness to pay for irrigation water can generate an agreeable estimate of the economic value of irrigation water and showed the income generated from the irrigation business. Therefore, the method and result help to plan a suitable water pricing modality, which enhances sustainable irrigation management and water productivity.","{""Alamirew, Tena"",""Bashe, Tsigemariam"",""Dejen, Zeleke Agide""}","10.1007/s40899-022-00764-4",2024-07-15 16:15:46,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Crop water productivity; Irrigation water valuation; Sustainable water management; Farmer's willingn""}"
6862811,"The Value Of Experimental Approaches In Migration Biology","The past several decades have ushered in a golden age in the study of migration biology, leading to a wealth of descriptive articles that characterize various aspects of migration and its implications for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. However, relatively few studies have adopted an experimental approach to the study of migration, and fewer still have combined lab and field experiments to glean insights into the mechanisms underlying variation in migration behavior and success. Understanding the proximate and ultimate causes of migration timing, energy allocation and optimization, migration success, and fitness is important to aid the conservation and management of wildlife populations by establishing appropriate protections or managing environmental conditions that influence migration. With recent technological advances and miniaturization of animal-borne electronic tracking devices, as well as ground-, water-, and space-based telemetry infrastructure, researchers have the tools necessary to experimentally test hypotheses central to the mechanics of migrations and individual variation therein. By pairing physiological measurements, molecular analyses, and other approaches within an experimental framework, there is the potential to understand not only how animal migrations function but also what differentiates successful migrations from failed migrations and the associated fitness implications. Experimental approaches to migration biology are particularly important, as they will help us to better comprehend and hopefully predict animal responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes by isolating confounding variables that challenge inferences from observations.","{""Aarestrup, Kim"",""Birnie-Gauvin, Kim"",""Cooke, Steven J."",""Crossin, Glenn T."",""Guglielmo, Christopher G."",""Lennox, Robert J."",""Norris, D.

6862812,"The Spatial Characteristics And Relationships Between Landscape Pattern And Ecosystem Service Value Along An Urban-Rural Gradient In Xi'an City, China","The spatial structure and function of Xi'an city is significantly affected by urbanization, a factor which can be considered as the main driver of landscape pattern and ecosystem service change. Due to these changes are a response to urban land use and land cover (LULC), remote sensing images are interpreted by the method of supervised classification and visual interpretation to obtain the LULC data for research on landscape pattern index (LPI) and ecosystem service value (ESV) of Xi'an city, China. Combined with urban planning theory, concentric buffer zones were used to explore the characteristics and relationships between LPIs and ESVs along an urban-rural gradient. Ten landscape indices and nine ecosystem service types were selected to analyze the correlation and construct multiple linear regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate the problem of multi-collinearity in the process of model construction. Results indicate that the highest landscape fragmentation was mainly distributed in the urban-rural fringe, 20-35 km from the urban center, and patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and landscape shape index (LSI) recorded the highest values. Total ESV of Xi'an city was 20493.65 x 10(6) CNY in 2016, and the mean value of ESV increased from 0.06 x 10(6) CNY to 2.60 x 10(6) CNY along an urban-rural gradient. This finding indicates that a higher ESV was recorded for the natural landscape. Results also indicated that SHAPE\_MN, FRAC\_MN, PLADJ, and AI recorded a positive effect on total ESV whilst ED and PD have a negative effect on total ESV. Results from the regression models showed quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs which revealed how ecosystem service values were affected by the landscape pattern.

6903534,"The Assessment Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Salinity Risk Using Neural Network","Soil salinity in the Aral Sea Basin is one of the major limiting factors of sustainable crop production. Leaching of the salts before planting season is usually a prerequisite for crop establishment and predetermined water amounts are applied uniformly to fields often without discerning salinity levels. The use of predetermined water amounts for leaching perhaps partly emanate from the inability of conventional soil salinity surveys (based on collection of soil samples, laboratory analyses) to generate timely and highresolution salinity maps. This paper has an objective to estimate the spatial distribution of soil salinity based on readily or cheaply obtainable environmental parameters (terrain indices, remote sensing data, distance to drains, and long-term groundwater observation data) using a neural network model. The farm-scale (~15 km 2) results were used to upscale soil salinity to a district area (~300 km 2). The use of environmental attributes and soil salinity relationships to upscale the spatial distribution of soil salinity from farm to district scale resulted in the estimation of essentially similar average soil salinity values (estimated 0.94 vs. 1.04 dS m -1). Visual comparison of the maps suggests that the estimated map had soil salinity that was uniform in distribution. The upscaling proved to be satisfactory; depending on critical salinity threshold values, around 70-90% of locations were correctly estimated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",NA,"10.1007/s10661-011-2132-5",2024-09-30 16:17:33,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""terra = terrain indices""}",NA
6863412,"Assessing The Impact Of Dams On Riparian And Deltaic Vegetation Using Remotely-Sensed Vegetation Indices And Random Forests Modelling","Riparian and deltaic areas exhibit a high biodiversity and offer a number of ecosystem services but are often degraded by human activities. Dams, for example, alter the hydrologic and sediment regimes of rivers and can negatively affect riparian areas and deltas. In order to sustainably manage these ecosystems, it is, therefore, essential to assess and monitor the impacts of dams. To this end, site-assessments and in-situ measurements have commonly been used in the past, but these can be laborious, resource demanding and time consuming. Here, we investigated the impact of three dams on the riparian forest of the Nestos River Delta in Greece by employing multi-temporal satellite data. We assessed the evolution in the values of eight vegetation indices over 27 years, derived from 14 dates of Landsat data. We also employed a modelling approach, using a machine learning Random Forests model, to investigate potential linkages between the observed changes in the indices and a host of climatic and terrestrial predictor variables. Our results show that low density vegetation (0–25%) is more affected by the construction of the dams due to its proximity to anthropogenic influences and the effects of hydrologic regime alteration. In contrast, higher density vegetation cover (50–75%) appears to be largely unaffected, or even improving, due to its proximity to the river, while vegetation with intermediate coverage (25–49%) exhibits no clear trend in the Landsat-derived indices. The Random Forests model found that the most important parameters for the riparian vegetation (based on the Mean Decrease Gini and the Mean Decrease Accuracy) were the distance to the dams, the sea and the river. Our results suggest that management plans of riparian and deltaic areas need to incorporate and take into consideration new innovative management practices and monitoring studies that employ multi-temporal satellite data archives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","{""Gounaridis, D."",""Symeonakis, E."",""Zaimes, G.

6863130,"Oceanography Of Harmful Algal Blooms On The Ecuadorian Coast (1997-2017): Integrating Remote Sensing And Biological Data","Ocean climate drivers and phytoplankton life strategies interact in a complex dynamic to produce harmful algal blooms (HABs). This study aims to integrate historical biological data collected during ""red tide"" events along the Ecuadorian coast between 1997 and 2017 in relation to five ocean variables derived from satellite remote sensing data to explain the seasonal drivers of coastal processes associated with HABs dynamics. Seasonality of the occurrence of HABs was assessed in relation to oceanographic variables by applying multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to the Ecuadorian central coast (Zone 1) and at the outer and inner Gulf of Guayaquil (Zone 2). Sixty-seven HABs events were registered between 1997 and 2017. From a total of 40 species of phytoplankton identified, 28 were identified as non-toxic and the remaining 12 are well known to produce toxins. Dinoflagellates were the taxonomic group most highly associated with potential HABs events along the entire Ecuadorian coast. HABs appear to be constrained by the Humboldt coastal upwelling, high precipitation, and associated coastal runoff, with higher biomass abundance in the Gulf of Guayaquil than in the central coast. Results from the MCA reveal that in the central Ecuadorian coast (oligotrophic system), toxic HABs occurred with low abundance of dinoflagellates, while in the Gulf of Guayaquil (eutrophic system), toxic HABs corresponded to a high abundance of dinoflagellates. In both cases, high values were found for sea surface temperature, precipitation, and irradiance-characteristic of wet seasons or El Niño years. Non-toxic HABs occurred with a high abundance of dinoflagellates, ciliates, and centric diatoms, corresponding to colder waters and low levels of precipitation and irradiance. These findings confirm that dinoflagellates display several strategies that enhance their productive capacity when ocean conditions are warmer, allowing them to produce toxins at high or at low concentrations. Considering that the Gulf of Guayaquil is essential to tourism, the shrimp industry, fisheries, and international shipping, these findings strongly suggest the need to establish an ecosystem health research program to monitor HABs and the development of a preventive policy for tourism and public health in Ecuador. © 2019 Borbor-Cordova, Torres, Mantilla-Saltos, Casierra-Tomala, Bermúdez, Renteria and Bayot.","{""Bayot, B."",""Borbor-Cordova, M.

6863656,"Soil-Related Predictors For Distribution Modelling Of Four European Crayfish Species","One of the most critical challenges in species distribution modelling is testing and validating various digitally derived environmental predictors (e.g., remote-sensing variables, topographic variables) by field data. Therefore, here we aimed to explore the value of soil properties in the spatial distribution of four European indigenous crayfish species. A database with 473 presence and absence locations in Romania for Austropotamobius bihariensis, A. torrentium, Astacus astacus and Pontastacus leptodactylus was used in relation to eight digitalised soil properties. Using random forest modelling, we found a preference for dense soils with lower coarse fragments content together with deeper sediment cover and higher clay values for A. astacus and P. leptodactylus. These descriptors trigger the need for cohesive soil river banks as the microenvironment for building their burrows. Conversely, species that can use banks with higher coarse fragments content, the highland species A. bihariensis and A. torrentium, prefer soils with slightly thinner sediment cover and lower density while not influenced by clay/sand content. Of all species, A. astacus was found related with higher erosive soils. The value of these soil-related digital descriptors may reside in the improvement of approaches in crayfish species distribution modelling to gain adequate conservation measures. © 2021 by the authors.

6863105,"Development Of A Spectral-Pattern-Analysis-Based Method For Automated Water Body Extraction Using Landsat Image Data: A Case Study In Central Vietnam And Southern Laos","Water body mapping is an important application of optical remote sensing. Methods for classifying water bodies using multispectral image data have been successfully developed for water resource monitoring and management. However, in most cases, these traditional methods provide only partial automation capabilities. In this study, we propose a new spectral-pattern-analysis-based (SPAB) method for water body extraction using simplified spectral patterns (SSPs). Simplified spectral patterns are a generalized transformation of spectral patterns from analogue to digital format, realized by nonrepetitive pairwise comparison of reflectance values between two bands. Simplified spectral patterns allow for the direct incorporation of spectral patterns into the recognition process. The advantage of this method compared to traditional methods is that the SPAB method allows automation of water body classification using an SSP database. In this study, we selected a mountainous region in central Vietnam and southern Laos as a study site. Four Landsat 8 OLI scenes from 2015 and four Landsat 7 ETM+ scenes from 2001 and 2002 were used. The results of our proposed method were compared with visual interpretation, normalized differential water index (NDWI) thresholding, and the Global Inland Water (GIW) dataset provided by the Global Land Cover Facility of the University of Maryland.

6862917,"Effects Of Interannual Variations In Environmental Conditions On Seasonal Range Selection By Mongolian Gazelles","To examine the effects of interannual variations in environmental conditions on the seasonal range selection and movement pattern of Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa, we compared the summer and winter ranges of satellite tracked gazelles among 3 years, and we analyzed the environmental conditions in the gazelles' seasonal ranges by using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The movement pattern of the tracked Mongolian gazelles was not regular migration between specific seasonal ranges. The locations of the summer ranges in 2003 and 2004 were similar for all gazelles, but in 2005, when the NDVI values were lower, the animals ranged about 30-70 km farther north, suggesting that the gazelles used areas of similar vegetation availability with former 2 years. The winter ranges were widely separated among years; the longest distance between winter ranges of the same individual in different years was about 340 km. During winter, the NDVI values of the winter ranges of tracked gazelles were almost always higher than or not significantly different from the mean of the 3-year range. Conservation strategies to allow access to wide ranges containing suitable areas in each year for gazelles, which location is changing interannually, are important. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","{""Buuveibaatar, B."",""Chimeddorj, B."",""Ito, T.

6863020,"Coffee Certification And Forest Quality: Evidence From A Wild Coffee Forest In Ethiopia","Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

6903664,"Emergency Post-Fire Rehabilitation Treatment Effects On Burned Area Ecology And Long-Term Restoration","The predicted continuation of strong drying and warming trends in the southwestern United States underlies the associated prediction of increased frequency, area, and severity of wildfires in the coming years. As a result, the management of wildfires and fire effects on public lands will continue to be a major land management priority for the foreseeable future. Following fire suppression, the first land management process to occur on burned public lands is the rapid assessment and emergency treatment recommendations provided by the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team. These teams of specialists follow a dynamic protocol to make post-fire treatment decisions based on the best available information using a range of landscape assessment, predictive modeling, and informational tools in combination with their collective professional expertise. Because the mission of a BAER team is to assess burned landscape and determine if stabilization treatments are needed to protect valued resources from the immediate fire effects, the evaluation of treatment success generally does not include important longer term ecological effects of these treatments or the fates of the materials applied over the burned landscape. New tools and techniques that have been designed or modified for BAER team use are presented in conjunction with current post-fire treatment effectiveness monitoring and research. In addition, a case is made to monitor longer term treatment effects on recovering ecosystems and to make these findings available to BAER teams.",NA,"10.4996/fireecology.0501115",2024-10-01 17:55:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862941,"Assessing The Provisioning Potential Of Ecosystem Services In A Scandinavian Boreal Forest: Suitability And Tradeoff Analyses On Grid-Based Wall-To-Wall Forest Inventory Data","Determining optimal forest management to provide multiple goods and services, also referred to as Ecosystem Services (ESs), requires operational-scale information on the suitability of the forest for the provisioning of various ESs. Remote sensing allows wall-to-wall assessments and provides pixel data for a flexible composition of the management units. The purpose of this study was to incorporate models of ES provisioning potential in a spatial prioritization framework and to assess the pixel-level allocation of the land use. We tessellated the forested area in a landscape of altogether 7500 ha to 27,595 pixels of 48 x 48 m(2) and modeled the potential of each pixel to provide biodiversity, timber, carbon storage, and recreational amenities as indicators of supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ESs, respectively. We analyzed spatial overlaps between the individual ESs, the potential to provide multiple ESs, and tradeoffs due to production constraints in a fraction of the landscape. The pixels considered most important for the individual ESs overlapped as much as 78\% between carbon storage and timber production and up to 52.5\% between the other ESs. The potential for multiple ESs could be largely explained in terms of forest structure as being emphasized to sparsely populated, spruce-dominated old forests with large average tree size. Constraining the production of the ESs in the landscape based on the priority maps, however, resulted in sub-optimal choices compared to an optimized production. Even though the land-use planning cannot be completed without involving the stakeholders' preferences, we conclude that the workflow described in this paper produced valuable information on the overlaps and tradeoffs of the ESs for the related decision support.

6903511,"An Assessment Of Anthropogenic And Climatic Stressors On Estuaries Using A Spatio-Temporal Gis-Modelling Approach For Sustainability: Towamba Estuary, Southeastern Australia","Monitoring estuarine ecological-geomorphological dynamics has become a crucial aspect of studying the impacts of climate change and worldwide infrastructure development in coastal zones. Together, these factors have changed the natural eco-geomorphic processes that affect estuarine regimes and comprehensive modelling of coastal resources can assist managers to make appropriate decisions about their sustainable use. This study has utilised Towamba estuary (southeastern NSW, Australia), to demonstrate the value and priority of modelling estuarine dynamism as a measure of the rates and consequences of eco-geomorphic changes. This research employs several geoinformatic modelling approaches over time to investigate and assess how climate change and human activities have altered this estuarine eco-geomorphic setting. Multitemporal trend/change analysis of sediment delivery, shoreline positions and land cover, determined from fieldwork and GIS analysis of remote sensing datasets, shows significant spatio-temporal changes to the elevation and areal extent of sedimentary facies in the Towamba estuary over the past 65 years. Geomorphic growth (~ 2600 m2 annually) has stabilised the estuarine habitats, particularly within native vegetation, salt marsh and mangrove areas. Geomorphic changes have occurred because of a combination of sediment runoff from the mostly unmodified terrestrial catchment, nearshore processes (ocean dynamics) and human activities. The construction of GIS models, verified with water and sediment samples, can characterise physical processes and quantify changes within the estuarine ecosystem. Such robust models will allow resource managers to evaluate the potential effects of changes to the current coastal ecosystems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",NA,"10.1007/s10661-018-6720-5",2024-10-03 22:00:44,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6447824,"A new normative economics for the formation of shared social values","There is mounting evidence that a new set of principles is required to form and express, rather than capture, social values for sustainability. This is because many policy questions are sufficiently complex that individual people do not—possible cannot—hold fully pre-formed values with respect to them. Thus, when people are faced with such issues, a process is required to enable them collectively to form and express a bespoke set of values that are shared. This process of shared social value formation can be understood as normative, to the extent that those involved participate in a process of ascribing values to others. This invites us to reconsider the role of normative economics, because it implies that both procedural and distributive justice is unlikely to be achieved through conventional economic logic and processes. The paper argues that the theoretical traditions that have juxtaposed positive and normative economics have been lost, such that rational choice has been progressively limited to the maximisation of economic surplus. This may be acceptable for some policy areas where the state and the individual dominate. However, the formation of social values for sustainability demands a composite approach that enables individuals to work together to form values with respect to issues about which they may have little immediate reference. The paper identifies five principles for establishing normative shared social values, relating to social units of analysis, procedural and distributive justice, dialectical decision-making and the development of social value transfer as a means of relating the shared social values formed and expressed in one context with those appropriate for a related context. The paper concludes with an agenda for research that can test, develop and refine the five principles for normative deliberated social values for sustainability.","{""Ravenscroft, Neil""}","10.1007/s11625-018-0652-4",NA,NA,NA,2019,"{}","{Deliberation,""Distributive justice"",""Normative economics"",""Shared social values"",""Social value transfer""}"
6863215,"European Union's Last Intact Forest Landscapes Are At A Value Chain Crossroad Between Multiple Use And Intensified Wood Production","Research Highlights: The European Union's last large intact forest landscapes along the Scandinavian Mountain range in Sweden o ff er unique opportunities for conservation of biodiversity, ecological integrity and resilience. However, these forests are at a crossroad between intensified wood production aimed at bio-economy, and rural development based on multi-functional forest landscapes for future-oriented forest value chains. Background and Objectives: We (1) estimate the area of near-natural forests potentially remaining for forest harvesting and wood production, or as green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation and human well-being in rural areas, (2) review how forest and conservation policies have so far succeeded to reduce the loss of mountain forests, and (3) discuss what economic, socio-cultural and ecological values that are at stake, as well as different governance and management solutions. Materials andMethods: First, we estimated the remaining amount of intact mountain forests using (1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory, (2) protected area statistics, (3) forest harvest permit applications and actually harvested forests, (4) remote sensing wall-to-wall data on forests not subject to clear-felling since the mid-1950s, (5) mapping of productive and non-productive forestland, and (6) estimates of mean annual final felling rate. Second, we review policy documents related to the emergence of land use regulation in north Sweden, including the mountain forest border, and illustrate this with an actual case that has had significant policy implementation importance. Results: There is a clear difference between the proportions of formally protected productive forestland above the mountain forest border (52.5\%) and north Sweden in general (6.3\%). A total of 300,000 ha of previously not clear-felled mountain forest outside protected areas remain, which can support novel value chains that are not achievable elsewhere. Conclusions: The mountain forests in Sweden provide unique conservation values in the European Union. Since the beginning of the 1990s, policy regulations have been successful in limiting forest harvesting. Currently, however, mountain forests are a battle ground regarding intensification of forest use, including logging of forests that have never been subject to clear-felling systems vs. nature conservation and wilderness as a base for rural development. The ability of mountain municipalities to encourage sustainable rural forest landscapes must be strengthened.","{""Angelstam, Per"",""Jonsson, Bengt Gunnar"",""Manton, Michael"",""Mikusinski, Grzegorz"",""Svensson, Johan""}","10.3390/f10070564",2024-07-15 15:58:03,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""green belt; amenity values; biodiversity conservation; continuous cover forestry; bioeconomy; rural ""}"
6863035,"Forest Landscape Restoration: Spectral Behavior And Diversity Of Tropical Tree Cover Classes","Forest landscape restoration (FLR) commitments have been established in the past years to restore over 200 million hectares, as part of the global Bonn Challenge goal, mostly through the implementation of several different restorative practices in degraded lands, ranging from com-mercial tree monocultures to restoration plantings. The potential of such contrasting restorative practices to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision vary over space and time, making the monitoring of FLR programs an emerging challenge. Remote sensing techniques, together with innovative technologies for data acquisition, treatment, and analysis have proven to be strategic for planning and monitoring FLR, yet there are still important un-resolved questions. Here, we evaluated the potential of multispectral orbital images of the high spatial (5 m) and spectral (12 bands) resolution VEN mu S microsatellite, joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES, to classify the spectral behavior and diversity of six tree cover classes (savanna woodlands, old-and second-growth semi-deciduous forests, young restoration plant-ings, and eucalyptus and pine tree monocultures) commonly found in FLR programs in tropical regions. We assessed how these tree cover classes located in a study landscape in southeastern Brazil differ according to their spectral response (winter and summer bands, and vegetation indices), canopy variability (textural features), seasonal behavior (delta layers -difference be-tween summer and winter vegetation indexes), and spectral diversity, and used these attributes as variables to the model. We used the Random Forest algorithm to generate the models and evaluate how the tree cover classes differ in the classification and how the variables supported the model. We achieved high values of global accuracy (91.9\%) and ""F1 score"" (above 0.8) for all tree cover classes, in which second-growth forest presented the lowest accuracy. The textural layers, delta layers, and the spectral diversity layers were the most important attributes to discriminate among tree cover classes. We demonstrate here the potential of using VEN mu S or similar sensor images together with different image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor FLR programs, allowing further remote sensing approaches and in-deep field assessments to advance evaluation of FLR benefits for nature and people. We demonstrated how the fusion of all these types of data and innovative approaches to data processing, can result in novel ways to assess restoration performance and open new avenues to upscale monitoring, bridging the gap between FLR expectations and achieved goals.","{""Alves de Almeida, Danilo Roberti"",""Brancalion, Pedro H.

Smart cities harness the power of data from sensors in order to understand and manage city systems. The most important of these sensing devices are smartphones as they provide the most important means to connect the smart city systems with its citizens, allowing personalization n and cocreation. The battery lifetime of smartphones is one of the most important parameters in achieving good user experience for the device. Therefore, the management and the optimization of handheld device applications in relation to their power consumption are an important area of research. This paper investigates the relationship between the energy consumption of a localization application and the strength of the global positioning system (GPS) signal. This is an important focus, because location-based applications are among the top power-hungry applications. We conduct experiments on two android location-based applications, one developed by us, and the other one, off the shelf. We use the results from the measurements of the two applications to derive a mathematical model that describes the power consumption in smartphones in terms of SNR and the time to first fix. The results from this study show that higher SNR values of GPS signals do consume less energy, while low GPS signals causing faster battery drain (38\% as compared with 13\%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a quantitative understanding of how the poor strength (SNR) of satellite signals will cause relatively higher power drain from a smartphone's battery.","{""Basalamah, Anas"",""Mehmood, Rashid"",""Tawalbeh, Hala"",""Tawalbeh, Lo'ai A.""}","10.1109/access.2016.2532745",2024-10-03 17:44:20,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2016,"{}","{""Green mobile computing; energy efficiency; smart cities; smart phones; signal strength; power model""}"
6863143,"Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms For Predicting And Digitally Mapping Surface Soil Available Phosphorous: A Case Study From Southwestern Iran","In developing countries like Iran, where information is scarce, understanding the spatial variability of soil available phosphorous (SAP), one of the three major nutrients, is crucial for effective agricultural ecosystem management. This study aimed to predict and digitally map the spatial distribution and related uncertainty of SAP while also assessing the impact of environmental factors on SAP variability in the topsoils. A study area from northern Khuzestan province, Iran was selected as case study area. Three machine learning (ML) models, namely, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were used to develop predictive relationship between surface soil (0-10 cm) SAP content and environmental covariates derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images. A total of 250 topsoil samples were collected following the conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) approach and several soil properties were measured in the laboratory. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) were used to determine the accuracy of models. The findings indicated that the RF algorithm demonstrated the most favorable performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 mg SAP kg-1, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.99 mg SAP kg-1, and the highest linear correlation coefficient (LCCC) values of 0.96. This suggests that the RF algorithm had the least tendency to overestimate or underestimate SAP contents compared to other methods. Consequently, the RF algorithm was selected as the optimal choice. Predictive ML models were employed to digitally map SAP contents within the region. Spatial patterns of SAP contents showed an increasing gradient from west to east. The spatial variability information provides a basis for developing sustainable production system in the area.","{""Biswas, Asim"",""Hojati, Saeid"",""Masir, Mojtaba Norouzi""}","10.1007/s11119-023-10099-5",2024-09-30 17:29:22,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2023,"{}","{""Covariates; Hyperparameters; Spatial; Uncertainty; Random forests""}"
6863617,"Object-Based Land Cover Change Detection For Cross-Sensor Images","Accurate and timely land cover change detection at regional and global scales is necessary for both natural resource management and global environmental change studies. Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in land cover change detection over the past three decades. The variety of satellites which have been launched for Earth Observation (EO) and the large volume of remotely sensed data archives acquired by different sensors provide a unique opportunity for land cover change detection. This article introduces an object-based land cover change detection approach for cross-sensor images. First, two images acquired by different sensors were stacked together and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the stacked data. Second, based on the Eigen values of the PCA transformation, six principal bands were selected for further image segmentation. Finally, a land cover change detection classification scheme was designed based on the land cover change patterns in the study area. An image-object classification was implemented to generate a land cover change map. The experiment was carried out using images acquired by Landsat 5 TM and IRS-P6 LISS3 over Daqing, China. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the change map were 83.42\% and 0.82, respectively. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to produce land cover change maps using cross-sensor images.","{""Ban, Y."",""Chen, F."",""Li, B."",""Niu, Z."",""Qin, Y.""}","10.1080/01431161.2013.805282",2024-07-17 21:22:00,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{calibration}",NA

Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, it reveals the complexity of the globalisation process and describes and accounts for the contradictory attitudes of the lower middle classes. The authors challenge the notion of a homogeneous Indian middle class as being the undoubted beneficiaries of recent neoliberal economic reforms, showing that while the lower middle classes are generally supportive of the recent economic reforms, they remain doubtful about the long term benefits of the country's New Economic Policy and liberalisation. Significantly, this book discusses and analyzes both the economic and cultural sides to globalisation in India, providing much-needed data in relation to several dimensions including the changing costs of living; household expenditure, debt and consumerism; employment and workplace restructuring; gender relations and girls' education; global media and satellite television; and the significance of English in a globalising India.

6863633,"Projecting The Impact Of Air Pollution On Child Stunting In India—Synergies And Trade-Offs Between Climate Change Mitigation, Ambient Air Quality Control, And Clean Cooking Access","Many children in India face the double burden of high exposure to ambient (AAP) and household air pollution, both of which can affect their linear growth. Although climate change mitigation is expected to decrease AAP, climate policies could increase the cost of clean cooking fuels. Here, we develop a static microsimulation model to project the air pollution-related burden of child stunting in India up to 2050 under four scenarios combining climate change mitigation (2 °C target) with national policies for AAP control and subsidised access to clean cooking. We link data from a nationally representative household survey, satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a multi-dimensional demographic projection and PM2.5 and clean cooking access projections from an integrated assessment model. We find that the positive effects on child linear growth from reductions in AAP under the 2 °C Paris Agreement target could be fully offset by the negative effects of climate change mitigation through reduced clean cooking access. Targeted AAP control or subsidised access to clean cooking could shift this trade-off to result in net benefits of 2.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.4, 4.2) or 6.5 (UI: 6.3, 6.9) million cumulative prevented cases of child stunting between 2020-50 compared to business-as-usual. Implementation of integrated climate, air quality, and energy access interventions has a synergistic impact, reducing cumulative number of stunted children by 12.1 (UI: 10.7, 13.7) million compared to business-as-usual, with the largest health benefits experienced by the most disadvantaged children and geographic regions. Findings underscore the importance of complementing climate change mitigation efforts with targeted air quality and energy access policies to concurrently deliver on carbon mitigation, health and air pollution and energy poverty reduction goals in India. © 2022 The Author(s).

In this study, 5 g of dry oyster soft tissues and 1.6 g of shell were both mineralized, preconcentrated on an AG50W-X8 and a strontium-specific resin, and measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The volumes of digestate used in the method for both matrices were optimized to reach a high preconcentration factor without any risk of oversaturating the columns. Out of the 50 mL of digestates, 48 mL and 2.5 mL were determined as optimal volumes for soft tissues and shell, respectively. To obtain a higher preconcentration factor and a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) for shell samples, three aliquots of 2.5 mL digestate were run on three different sets of resins and, ultimately, combined for Ra analysis using ICP-MS. LOQs of 7.7 and 0.3 fg/g (260 and 11 mu Bq/g) were achieved for the oyster shell and soft tissues, respectively. The new protocols were applied on relevant samples: oyster soft tissues and shell from New Brunswick, Canada, and different types of reference materials, such as IAEA-470, oyster soft tissue and IAEA-A-12, and animal bones. 226Ra recovery of 105 +/- 3\% (n = 6) was achieved for IAEA-A-12 (animal bones), the closest available reference material to shell with a recommended value for 226Ra. Resin performances were investigated using 226Ra standard solution and real samples: each set of columns could be used more than 100 times without any significant reduction in Ra preconcentration efficiency. Although the method proposed and validated in this work was developed for oysters, it could easily be applied to other matrices by adjusting the volume of digestate run on the resins to avoid their oversaturation.",NA,"10.3390/separations10100529",2024-10-03 21:53:57,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""sentinel organism""}",NA
6863088,"A Market-Based Mechanism For Long-Term Groundwater Management Using Remotely Sensed Data","Groundwater markets improve the agricultural economy by transferring water entitlements from low-efficient users to high-efficient ones to maximize productivity. Aiming at developing an efficient groundwater market, the environmental effects of the market mechanism should be assessed, and a reliable method for monitoring water consumption needs to be employed. Toward this end, this paper proposes three annual smart groundwater market mechanisms to maximize water net benefits, minimize groundwater withdrawal, and precisely measure water consumption in agricultural fields. To guarantee the aquifer's safe yield in each mechanism, a groundwater simulation model (i.e., Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)) is used to control groundwater table drawdown at the end of the planning horizon. In addition, the fields' evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) algorithm to measure the net groundwater consumption during the market. In this regard, we evaluated the algorithms' performances using observed data from a local lysimeter. They are applied to the Nough plain in Iran to assess the effectiveness of the proposed market framework. The findings illustrate their efficiency in recovering approximately 80\% (23.33 million cubic meters (MCM)) of groundwater loss due to overexploitation in the study area and increasing the users' annual benefits by 10.6\% compared to the non -market condition. In addition, results imply that the METRIC model approximates daily crop ET with a higher accuracy level than the SEBAL model with RMSE, MAE, and Percentage Error of 0.37 mm/day, 0.32 mm/day, and 14.92\%, respectively.

6903647,"Forest Burned Area Detection Using A Novel Spectral Index Based On Multi-Objective Optimization","Forest fires cause environmental and economic damage, destroy large areas of land and displace entire communities. Accurate extraction of fire-affected areas is of vital importance to support post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact of fires. In this paper, an analytical burned area index, called ABAI, was proposed to map burned areas from the newly launched Sentinel-2 images. The innovation of this method is to separate the fire scars from other typical land covers by formulating different objective functions, which involved three main components: First, spectral differences between the burned land and other land covers were characterized by analyzing the spectral features of the existing burned area indices. Then, for each type of land cover, we formed an objective function by linear combination of bands with the values of band ratios. Second, all the objective functions and possible constraints were formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and then it was solved using a linear programming approach. Finally, the ABAI spectral index was achieved with the optimizing coefficients derived from the multi-objective problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral index, three experimental datasets, clipped from Sentinel-2 images at different places, were tested and compared with baseline indices, such as normalized burned area (NBR) and burned area index (BAI) methods. Experimental results demonstrated that the injection of a green band to the spectral index has led to good applicability in burned area detection, where the ABAI can avoid most of the confusion presented by shadows or shallow water. Compared to other burned area indices, the proposed ABAI achieved the best classification accuracy, with the overall accuracy being over 90\%. Visually, our approach significantly outperforms other spectral indexed methods, especially in confused areas covered by water bodies and shadows.",NA,"10.3390/f13111787",2024-09-27 18:42:40,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{validation}",NA
6903537,"Knowledge Graph Construction Method Of Gold Mine Based On Ontology","Geological and mineral resource survey and scientific research in ""geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and remote sensing "" have established a large amount of geological and mineral survey data, which contain rich knowledge related to mineralization and distribution of gold mine, such as the metallogenic and tectonic setting, geological environment of occurrence, geological characteristics of mineral mine, genesis and metallogenic model of mine, and so on. The transformation from massive mineral related data to effective metallogenic knowledge has become one of the most important breakthroughs to improve the accuracy of geological prospecting. To solve this problem, through the in- depth analysis of knowledge representation, information extraction, and knowledge fusion in knowledge engineering, this paper explores the knowledge graph construction method of gold mine based on ontology. Firstly, referring to industry norms, gold mine knowledge base, and reference material of geological and mineral resource exploration, the metallogenic model of gold mine is sorted out, and the gold mine concept, gold mine entity, gold mine relationship, gold mine geological attribute, and gold mine metallogenic attribute are determined. In addition, the schema layer of gold mine knowledge graph is constructed by using the top- down ontology knowledge representation method, which represents the conceptual model and logical basis of gold mine knowledge graph. Secondly, based on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured multi-source heterogeneous geological data, the deep learning model is used to realize gold mine knowledge extraction, semantic analysis, and knowledge fusion, which enriches the data layer of gold mine knowledge graph and provides data support for gold mine knowledge graph. The gold mine knowledge graph is constructed in a bottom- up way, and the gold mine knowledge triplet is stored by Neo4j graph database, in which nodes represent gold mine concept, gold mine entity, and gold mine attribute value, while edges represent relation and attribute. Finally, the gold mine knowledge management system is developed based on the graph database. It can be applied to the management of gold mine data, acquisition of knowledge, visualization representation of gold mine knowledge graph, inquiry of knowledge, management and presentation of knowledge base, and other functions well, so as to lay a foundation for the intelligent analysis and mining of geological big data. This study develops a geological prospecting method driven by data and knowledge, and provides a reference for identifying, controlling, and managing mineral resources, which can improve the prospecting accuracy in geological exploration. © 2023 Journal of Geo-Information Science.

6863399,"An Implementation Of Open Source-Based Software As A Service (Saas) To Produce Toa And Toc Reflectance Of High-Resolution Kompsat-3/3a Satellite Image","The majority of cloud applications are created or delivered to provide users with access to system resources or prebuilt processing algorithms for efficient data storage, management, and production. The number of cases linking cloud computing to the use of global observation satellite data continues to rise, owing to the benefits of cloud computing. This study aims to develop a cloud software as a service (SaaS) that yields reflectance products in high-resolution Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT)-3/3A satellite images. The SaaS model was designed as three subsystems: a Calibration Processing System (CPS), a Request System for CPS supporting RESTful application programming interface (API), and a Web Interface Application System. Open-source components, libraries, and frameworks were used in this study’s SaaS, including an OpenStack for infrastructure as a service. An absolute atmospheric correction scheme based on a Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code with atmospheric variable inputs was used to generate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance products. The SaaS implemented in this study provides users with the absolute atmospheric calibration functionality to apply their KOMPSAT-3/3A satellite image set through a web browser and obtain output directly from this service. According to experiments to check the total performance time for images, bundled with four bands of red, green, blue, and near-infrared, it took approximately 4.88 min on average for the execution time to obtain all reflectance results since satellite images were registered into the SaaS. The SaaS model proposed and implemented in this study can be used as a reference model for the production system to generate reflectance products from other optical sensor images. In the future, SaaS, which offers professional analysis functions based on open source, is expected to grow and expand into new application fields for public users and communities. © 2021 by the authors.

6863317,"Vascular Epiphytes In An Urban Environment Are Influenced By Tree Characteristics, Climate And Propagule Sources","Urban trees provide multiple benefits for the citizens such as shadow provision and climate regulation. In addition, it can contribute to the conservation of native plants from the ecoregion where the city is located, although there is not much information about it. In this study, species richness, cover and composition of vascular epiphytes were analyzed in urban trees of Gran San Miguel de Tucumán. We sampled epiphytes over 240 trees in 24 sites located in the localities of Horco Molle, El Corte, Yerba Buena and San Miguel de Tucumán. We recorded characteristics of trees (i.e., diameter at breast height [DBH], bark type and number of pruned branches) and sites (distance from the nearest source of epiphyte propagules such as sierra San Javier and urban green spaces, temperature and humidity using satellite images). Significant increases of species richness and cover of epiphytes were recorded with tree DBH and rough barks. Both features are important for vascular epiphyte establishment because they allow more surface and time available for colonization and a rough bark accumulates water and organic matter. In addition, epiphyte richness increased in trees closer to Sierra de San Javier, and in sites with lower temperature and higher humidity. The locality of Horco Molle, closer to sierra de San Javier, had a different composition of epiphytes compared to the other localities. Interactions between host trees and vascular epiphytes were similar to those observed in pristine forests of sierra de San Javier. These results are relevant for urban vegetation management because they allow us to consider urban trees as an important contribution to the conservation of native Yungas epiphytes. © 2021, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

6862862,"Intercalibration Of Vegetation Indices From Different Sensor Systems","Spectroradiometric measurements were made over a range of crop canopy densities, soil backgrounds and foliage colour. The reflected spectral radiances were convoluted with the spectral response functions of a range of satellite instruments to simulate their responses. When Normalised Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) from the different instruments were compared, they varied by a few percent, but the values were strongly linearly related, allowing vegetation indices from one instrument to be intercalibrated against another. A table of conversion coefficents is presented for AVHRR, ATSR-2, Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+, SPOT-2 and SPOT-4 HRV, IRS, IKONOS, SEAWIFS, MISR, MODIS, POLDER, Quickbird and MERI S (see Appendix A for glossary of acronyms). The same set of coefficients was found to apply, within the margin of error of the analysis, for the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index SAVI. The relationships for SPOT vs. TM and for ATSR-2 vs. AVHRR were directly validated by comparison of atmospherically corrected image data. The results indicate that vegetation indices can be interconverted to a precision of 1-2\%. This result offers improved opportunities for monitoring crops through the growing season and the prospects of better continuity of long-term monitoring of vegetation responses to environmental change.

6862738,"Mapping Canopy Nitrogen In European Forests Using Remote Sensing And Environmental Variables With The Random Forests Method","Canopy nitrogen (N) influences carbon (C) uptake by vegetation through its important role in photosynthetic enzymes. Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) predict C assimilation, but are limited by a lack spatial canopy N input. Mapping canopy N has been done in various ecosystems using remote sensing (RS) products, but has rarely considered environmental variables as additional predictors. Our research objective was to estimate spatial patterns of canopy N in European forests and to investigate the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone. The environmental variables included were climate, soil properties, altitude, N deposition and land cover, while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and NIR reflectance from MODIS and MERIS sensors, the MOD13Q1 and MTCI products, respectively. The results showed that canopy N could be estimated both within and among forest types using the random forests technique and calibration data from ICP Forests with good accuracy (r2 = 0.62, RRMSE = 0.18). The predicted spatial pattern shows higher canopy N in mid-western Europe and relatively lower values in both southern and northern Europe. For all subgroups tested (All plots, Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF) plots and Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF) plots), including environmental variables improved the predictions. Including environmental variables was especially important for the DBF plots, as the prediction model based on remotely sensed data products predicted canopy N with the lowest accuracy. © 2020 The Authors","{""Karssenberg, D."",""Loozen, Y."",""Lu, M."",""Ollinger, S.

6863133,"A Random Forest Algorithm For Landsat Image Chromatic Aberration Restoration Based On Gee Cloud Platform—A Case Study Of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico","With the growth of cloud computing, the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to conduct research on water inversion, natural disaster monitoring, and land use change using long time series of Landsat images has also gradually become mainstream. Landsat images are currently one of the most important image data sources for remote sensing inversion. As a result of changes in time and weather conditions in single-view images, varying image radiances are acquired; hence, using a monthly or annual time scale to mosaic multi-view images results in strip color variation. In this study, the NDWI and MNDWI within 50 km of the coastline of the Yucatán Peninsula from 1993 to 2021 are used as the object of study on GEE platform, and mosaic areas with chromatic aberrations are reconstructed using Landsat TOA (top of atmosphere reflectance) and SR (surface reflectance) images as the study data. The DN (digital number) values and probability distributions of the reference image and the image to be restored are classified and counted independently using the random forest algorithm, and the classification results of the reference image are mapped to the area of the image to be restored in a histogram-matching manner. MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDWI products are used for comparison and validation. The results demonstrate that the restored Landsat NDWI and MNDWI images do not exhibit obvious band chromatic aberration, and the image stacking is smoother; the Landsat TOA images provide improved results for the study of water bodies, and the correlation between the restored Landsat SR and TOA images with the Sentinel-2 data is as high as 0.5358 and 0.5269, respectively. In addition, none of the existing Landsat NDWI products in the GEE platform can effectively eliminate the chromatic aberration of image bands. © 2022 by the authors.","{""Li, J."",""Li, J."",""Ma, T."",""Shao, J."",""Su, Y."",""Yan, X."",""Yang, D."",""Zhang, R.""}","10.3390/rs14205154",2024-07-16 23:56:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Google Earth Engine"",Landsat}"
6863688,"Multi-Index Time Series Monitoring Of Drought And Fire Effects On Desert Grasslands","The Western United States is expected to undergo both extended periods of drought and longer wildfire seasons under forecasted global climate change and it is important to understand how these disturbances will interact and affect recovery and composition of plant communities in the future. In this research paper we describe the temporal response of grassland communities to drought and fire in southern Arizona, where land managers are using repeated, prescribed fire as a habitat restoration tool. Using a 25-year atlas of fire locations, we paired sites with multiple fires to unburned control areas and compare satellite and field-based estimates of vegetation cover over time. Two hundred and fifty Landsat TM images, dating from 1985-2011, were used to derive estimates of Total Vegetation Fractional Cover (TVFC) of live and senescent grass using the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) and post-fire vegetation greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also implemented a Greenness to Cover Index that is the difference of time-standardized SATVITvFc and NDVI values at a given time and location to identify post-fire shifts in native, non-native, and annual plant cover. The results highlight anomalous greening and browning during drought periods related to amounts of annual and non-native plant cover present. Results suggest that aggressive application of prescribed fire may encourage spread of non-native perennial grasses and annual plants, particularly during droughts.

They have become an essential part of human resource practices, such as recruiting, employee engagement, and the marketing of a company's brand. Crowdsourcing platforms can help enrich an employer's brand, with employee reviews acting as a terra-incognita for the early-stages in the employer branding process. In response to these dynamics, this research explores the employer value proposition preferences and the sentiments of employees in the US banking industry. Approximately 11,000 reviews on the crowdsourcing platform Indeed.com, covering the top 18 banks listed on the Fortune 500, were parsed. The text mining techniques topic modeling and sentiment analysis were carried out using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The topic modeling analysis revealed work-life balance, management, economic, social, and development values as the most preferred employer value proposition, while brand-image, application, and interest values were the least preferred. Sentiment analysis showed that employees exhibit negative sentiments for management, work stress, work-life balance, and economic values, and show positive sentiments for development, social, and interest values.

6862796,"Heritage As Restitution: The Dadaab Refugee Camps, Kenya","Recognizing architectures of unelected migration as sites of modern history and heritage not only expands the consideration of modernities in Africa but also constitutes a form of restitution to those who have fled insecurity and violence imposed by others. In this paper and pictorial presentation based on 12 years of archival and on-site research, I argue that the Dadaab refugee camps and their inhabitation of the Kenya-Somalia borderland may be understood and valued for a long history as well as a recent materiality, which has taken form in architecture, spatial practices, and territorial construction. Rather than accepting the relegation of refugee architecture to policy studies or the applied social sciences, which privilege the logics of emergency and an epistemology of the security state over knowledge stemming from people's migratory lives, this paper takes seriously the paradoxes of Dadaab as a heritage site. At Dadaab, the Kenyan government and UNHCR established relief operations in a region inscribed with colonial and postcolonial frontiers and wars, carrying a memory of detention and an imaginary of a borderland. These modern historical forces are reiterated in humanitarian settlements holding half a million registered refugees and unregistered migrants, enacting confinement in architectures figured as much by the visual frailty of dwellings dusted red by the wind and clad in recovered textile fragments as by a spectacular array of satellite dishes, aeronautic fleets on tarmac, aluminum and polyvinyl chloride water storage towers, and hydraulic extraction machinery penetrating a Jurassic-era aquifer. These architectures signal transience even if anchored in the earth and sky, part of an ecology that once supported pastoralists and now undergirds another migratory world. My pictorially oriented paper uses these historical and aesthetic paradoxes to argue for this complex African heritage site, and with it, restitution of a fraught landscape of migration through a meaningful reconsideration of modern heritage.","{""Siddiqi, Anooradha Iyer""}","10.1111/cura.12511",2024-09-30 02:18:59,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2022,"{""satellite dishes"",spurious}",NA
6863687,"Natural And Anthropogenic Forcings Lead To Contrasting Vegetation Response In Long-Term Vs. Short-Term Timeframes","Understanding vegetation response to natural and anthropogenic forcings is vital for managing watersheds as natural ecosystems. We used a novel integrated framework to separate the impacts of natural factors (e.g. drought, precipitation and temperature) from those of anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity) on vegetation cover change at the watershed scale. We also integrated several datasets including satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a twenty-year time period (2000–2019). Our results show that despite no significant trend being observed in temperature and precipitation, vegetation indices expressed an increasing trend at both the control and treated watersheds. The vegetation cover was not significantly affected by the natural factors whereas the watershed management practice (as a human activity) had significant impacts on vegetation change in the long-term. Further, the vegetation cover long-term response to watershed management practice was mainly linear. We also found that the vegetation indices values in the 2011–2019 period (as the treated period in treated watershed) were significantly higher than those in the 2000–2010 period. In the short-term, however, the drought condition and decreased precipitation (as natural factors) explained the majority of the change in vegetation cover. For example, the majority of the breakpoints occurred in 2008, and it was related to a widespread extreme drought in the area. The watershed management practice as a human activity along with extreme climatic events could explain a large part of the vegetation changes observed in the treated and control watersheds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","{""Alipour, H."",""Jamali, S."",""Kazemzadeh, M."",""Noori, Z."",""Seyednasrollah, B.""}","10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112249",2024-07-19 21:10:24,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{DBEST,Iran,PolyTrend}"
6863212,"Assessment Of Water Quality In Lake Garda (Italy) Using Hyperion","For testing the integration of the remote sensing related technologies into the water quality monitoring programs of Lake Garda (the largest Italian lake), the spatial and spectral resolutions of Hyperion and the capability of physics-based approaches were considered highly suitable. Hyperion data were acquired on 22nd July 2003 and water quality was assessed (i) defining a bio-optical model, (ii) converting the Hyperion atsensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectances, and (iii) adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The bio-optical model was parameterised using specific inherent optical properties of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. A MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code, complemented with an air/water interface correction was used to convert Hyperion at-sensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectance values. These reflectance values were comparable to in situ reflectance spectra measured during the Hyperion overpass, except at longer wavelengths (beyond 700 nm), where reflectance values were contaminated by severe atmospheric adjacency effects. Chlorophyll-a and tripton concentrations were retrieved by inverting two Hyperion bands selected using a sensitivity analysis applied to the bio-optical model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the assessment of coloured dissolved organic matter was not achievable in this study due to the limited coloured dissolved organic matter concentration range of the lake, resulting in reflectance differences below the environmental measurement noise of Hyperion. The chlorophyll-a and tripton image-products were compared to in situ data collected during the Hyperion overpass, both by traditional sampling techniques (8 points) and by continuous flow-through systems (32 km). For chlorophyll-a the correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-inferred concentrations was 0.77 (data range from 1.30 to 2.16 mg m(-3)). The Hyperion-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations also match most of the flow-through transect data. For tripton, the validation was constrained by variable re-suspension phenomena. The correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-derived concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.75 (data range from 0.95 to 2.13 g m(-3)) if the sampling data from the re-suspension zone was avoided. The comparison of Hyperionderived tripton concentrations and flow-through transect data exhibited a similar mismatch. The results of this research suggest further studies to address compatibilities of validation methods for water body features with a high rate of change, and to reduce the contamination by atmospheric adjacency effects on Hyperion data at longer wavelengths in Alpine environment. The transferability of the presented method to other sensors and the ability to assess water quality independent from in situ water quality data, suggest that management relevant applications for Lake Garda (and other subalpine lakes) could be supported by remote sensing.

However, anthropogenic activities and climate change are severely pressuring these ecosystem services. Changes in land use/cover (LU/LC) induced by human activities affect the environment's ecosystem and alter the ecosystem services value (ESV). Decision-making on development based on ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment is significant for the sustainable utilization of resources. In the current study, Beijing in China from 1995 to 2015 and Freetown in Sierra Leone from 2000 to 2018 were used for monitoring the change in (LU/LC) and ecosystem services. To investigate the changes in ESV utilizing an ESV model, cross-sectional field research, GIS technology and economic valuation of natural capital were all combined. In Beijing, land use and land cover (LU/LC) were as follows: forest > farm > urban > water in all periods of the investigated sites. Furthermore, LULC in Freetown was as follows: dense vegetation > spare vegetation > urban > bare > water in 2018. Changes in LU/LC in two areas reflect the trend toward the agriculture sector. Prediction of LU/LC showed a significant decrease in the agriculture areas in Beijing and Freetown that negatively affected the ecosystem. Results showed a lower ESV after prediction than before prediction in Beijing and Freetown, with loss and decrease in ESV caused by excessive economic benefits. Results showed that dense vegetation contributed the most to ecosystem services overall. The finding from this work indicated that for better sustainable ecosystem services, effective land-use regulations should be taken to control vegetation deterioration and protect water bodies.",NA,"10.1007/s11852-022-00927-7",2024-10-01 17:24:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862975,"Adaptation Of The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation To Map Spatial Distribution Of Soil Erosion In Tropical Watersheds: A Gis/Rs-Based Study Of The Upper Mahaweli River Catchment Of Sri Lanka","Soil erosion is a serious issue in highland areas of Sri Lanka that are dominated by extensive agricultural activities. Methods capable of rapidly assessing soil erosion are required to determine suitable conservation methods and to monitor their effectiveness to preserve this non-renewable resource. The widely used method of determining soil erosion rate is the use of field measurements and/or empirical modeling. Although the latter method along with the use of GIS/Remote Sensing has become very popular, its main limitations are the lack of model validation and lack of comparison of modeled rates with acceptable soil loss tolerance values. In this study, soil erosion rates of six sub-catchments were calculated with the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) following five different methods in GIS/RS environment and then compared with field-based measurements for verification. The mean modeled soil erosion rates of the six sub-catchments were within 0.12 and 7.70 t ha(-1) y(-1), whereas the field-based rates range from 1.14 to 15.83 t ha(-1) y(-1). Moreover, modeled erosion classes within the sub-catchments were similar to field-based localized erosion rates over different land use types quantified from plot experiments. Hence, we recommend the integration of RUSLE with GIS/RS as an effective tool for soil erosion hazard mapping at the catchment scale. We propose a typical rate of 1 t ha(-1) y(-1) and an upper limit of 2 t ha(-1) y(-1) as the soil loss tolerance level for the study area based on experimentally derived soil production rates.

6863332,"The Cost Of Renal Dialysis In A Uk Setting - A Multicentre Study","Background. The UK National Health Service (NHS) will fund renal services using Payment by Results (PbR), from 2009. Central to the success of PbR will be the creation of tariffs that reflect the true cost of medical services. We have therefore estimated the cost of different dialysis modalities in the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust and six other hospitals in the UK. Methods. We used semi-structured interviews with nephrologists, head nurses and business managers to identify the steps involved in delivering the different dialysis modalities. We assigned costs to these using published figures or suppliers' published price lists. The study used mixed costing methods. Dialysis costs were estimated by a combination of microcosting and a top-down approach. Where we did not have access to detailed accounts, we applied values for Cardiff. Results. The most efficient modalities were automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the mean annual costs of which were 21 pound 655 and 15 pound 570, respectively. Hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) cost 35 pound 023 per annum and satellite-unit-based HD cost 32 pound 669. The cost of home-based HD was 20 pound 764 per year (based on data from only one unit). The main cost drivers for PD were the costs of solutions and management of anaemia. For HD they were costs of disposables, nursing, the overheads associated with running the unit and management of anaemia. Conclusions. Renal tariffs for PbR need to reflect the true cost of dialysis provision if choices about modalities are not to be influenced by erroneous estimates of cost. Knowledge of the true costs of modalities will also maximize the number of established renal failure patients treated by dialysis within the limited funds available from the NHS.","{""Baboolal, Keshwar"",""McEwan, Philip"",""Sondhi, Seema"",""Spiewanowski, Piotr"",""Wechowski, Jaroslaw"",""Wilson, Karen""}","10.1093/ndt/gfm870",2024-09-30 17:31:29,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2008,"{""satellite unit medical"",spurious}","{""cost; haemodialysis; health economics; peritoneal dialysis; renal failure""}"

6863167,"Evaluating The Ability To Use Contextual Features Derived From Multi-Scale Satellite Imagery To Map Spatial Patterns Of Urban Attributes And Population Distributions","With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management. Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (<2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral signatures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R-2 values up to 93\%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84\% of the out-of-sample variation for population density.","{""Bedada, Adane"",""Chao, Steven"",""Engstrom, Ryan"",""Mann, Michael""}","10.3390/rs13193962",2024-07-19 20:59:42,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{calibration}","{""machine learning; contextual features; population; urban attributes; modeling; spatial resolution""}"
6863451,"Evaluation Of The Impacts Of The “Uma Terra E Duas Águas” Program (P1+2) On The Quality Of Life And Environmental Sustainability Of Beneficiaries In The Semiarid Region Of Ceará, Brazil","Purpose: Social policies for accessing water during droughts have contributed to coexisting with dry periods. One of these policies involves the construction of cisterns through the “Um Milhão de Cisternas” Program (P1MC) and the “Uma Terra e Duas Águas” Program (P1+2). To comprehend the effects of P1+2, this study aims to assess its impacts on the quality of life and environmental sustainability of beneficiaries compared to non-beneficiaries. Method/design/approach: The research was conducted in the municipalities of Canindé and Itapiúna, Ceará, and data were collected through questionnaires administered to P1+2 beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. From the data, the Quality of Life Index (QLI) and the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) were calculated for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Results and conclusion: The QLI of beneficiaries was lower than that of non-beneficiaries, suggesting a need for greater monitoring of beneficiaries and potential adaptations. The ESI was higher for beneficiaries, indicating some effect of the program on environmental sustainability. The low ESI for beneficiaries highlights weaknesses in the context of water security in the semiarid region. Research implications: Contributing to the improvement of P1+2, population quality of life, and environmental sustainability.

6863657,"Variation Of Airborne Bacteria And Fungi At Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum, Xi'an, China, During The ""Oct. 1"" Gold Week Period Of 2006","Background, aim, and scope: To stimulate the national economy, a so-called ""gold week"" comprising May Day and National Day has been put in force by the government, and the first golden-week holiday began on October 1, 1999. Statistical data show that about 15,000 visitors were received each day by Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum during just such a gold week period. To evaluate the effects of tourism on indoor air, airborne samples were collected by the sedimentation plate method for 5 min during the ""Oct. 1"" gold week period of 2006, and both composition and changes of airborne bacteria and fungi in indoor/outdoor air in the museums were investigated. Materials and methods: Airborne microbes were simultaneously collected by means of gravitational sedimentation on open Petri dishes. Three parallel samples were collected at the same time each day, and samples were subsequently incubated in the lab. Microbiology media were prepared before each experiment by a professional laboratory. Concentrations were calculated and presented as average data of colony-forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m3). Results: The results show that (1) 13 bacterial genera and eight genera of fungi were identified from indoor and outdoor air at Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum during ""Oct. 1"" gold week in 2006. The bacterial groups occupied 61%, the fungi groups occupied 36%, and others occupied 3% of the total number of isolated microorganism genera. (2) As for the comparison of indoor and outdoor samples, the average concentrations of fungi were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (09:00). The average concentrations of bacteria in indoor air were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00), and in outdoor air, they were lower during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00). (3) The average concentrations of five dominant groups of bacteria and three dominant groups of fungi were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00) in the indoor air, but the average concentrations of fungi were higher and those of bacteria were lower during the afternoon than for the morning, for outdoor air. (4) As for the comparison of indoor samples, the bacterial daily concentrations and fungal daily concentrations were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than those for the mornings (9:00) over the 10 days. For the comparison of outdoor samples, the bacterial concentration was lower, and the fungal concentrations were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than those for the morning (9:00) over the 10 days. Discussion: The results also show that the numbers of airborne bacteria and fungi had a daily character in indoor air and were higher in the afternoon. The airborne microbe concentrations were found to be similar to residential indoor values from other reports; the indoor museum maximum of microbial concentrations was 90 CFU/m3 and did not exceed the Chinese indoor bioaerosol guideline. However, microorganisms may fall on the surface of display items as a result of particle sedimentation and would, as such, be capable of degrading objects by way of their secretions, e.g., enzymes and organic acids. Therefore, the right steps should be taken to prevent any deterioration in the quality of displayed artifacts. Conclusions: The results show that museum air was affected by human activity; therefore, it is imperative that the number of visitors be strictly limited and that windows be opened regularly to avoid air pollution. Recommendations and perspectives: The data provide a significant scientific basis for indoor air quality control and museum scientific management. It is recommended that the number of visitors be strictly limited. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","{""Chen, Y. P."",""Cui, Y."",""Dong, J.

6863533,"Probabilistic Assessment Of Cloud Fraction Using Bayesian Blending Of Independent Datasets: Feasibility Study Of A New Method","We describe and evaluate a novel method to blend two observed cloud fraction (CF) datasets through Bayesian posterior estimation. The research reported here is a feasibility study designed to explore the method. In this proof-of-concept study, we illustrate the approach using specific observational datasets from the U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's Southern Great Plains site in the central United States, but the method is quite general and is readily applicable to other datasets. The total sky image (TSI) camera observations are used to determine the prior distribution. A regression model and the active remote sensing of clouds (ARSCL) radar/lidar observations are used to determine the likelihood function. The posterior estimate is a probability density function (pdf) of the CF whose mean is taken to be the optimal blend of the two observations. The data at hourly, daily, 5-day, monthly, and annual time scales are considered. Some physical and probabilistic properties of the CFs are explored from radar/lidar, camera, and satellite observations and from simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5). Our results imply that (a) the Beta distribution is a reasonable model for CF for both short- and long-time means, the 5-day data are skewed right, and the annual data are almost normally distributed, and (b) the Bayesian method developed successfully yields a pdf of CF, rather than a deterministic CF value, and it is feasible to blend the TSI and ARSCL data with a capability for bias correction.

6863199,"A Scale-Adjusted Measure Of ""Urban Sprawl"" Using Nighttime Satellite Imagery","""Urban Sprawl"" is a growing concern of citizens, environmental organizations, and governments. Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of ""Urban Sprawl"" range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The 'scale-adjustment' mentioned in the title characterizes the ""Urban Sprawl"" of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the ""Sprawl Line"" determined by this regression. This ""Sprawl Line"" allows for a more fair comparison of ""Urban Sprawl"" between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more ""Urban Sprawl"" by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of ""Urban Sprawl"" by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to ""Urban Sprawl"". ""Urban Sprawl"" is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are 'scale-adjusted'; also, the spatial patterns of ""Urban Sprawl"" shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of ""Urban Sprawl"" are changing.

6863198,"Cooling Effect Of Urban Green And Blue Infrastructure: A Systematic Review Of Empirical Evidence","Urban green and blue infrastructure (GBI) plays an extremely important role in regulating urban climate and assisting cities to cope with future climate change and enhance urban resilience. This paper presents a comprehensive review of urban green and blue infrastructure researches on cooling effect trends and hotspots, and the distribution of cooling effect studies in different climatic zones. Most studies focused on surface types and configurations, urban parks and water bodies, roof greening (building energy conservation), ecological benefits, thermal comfort, plant communities, etc. through remote sensing imagery, ground measurement, and comprehensive simulation. Most studies were influenced by the research field (perspective) and the research scale dependence of urban green and blue infrastructure cooling effect was extremely obvious. Based on the Koppen climate classification, the research methods, indicators and key issues are different at scale level. Through the analysis of cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure and its influencing factors from the landscape, patch (corridor) and community scale, we found that the cooling effect was mainly affected by the proportion of ecological land, landscape pattern (landscape scale); patch area, underlying surface type (patch scale); and plant configuration, single plant (community scale), etc. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and the results showed that, on average, a park was 1.39 °C cooler in temperate climate zone and 3.12 °C cooler in continental climate zone. On this basis, this paper summarizes three challenges in the future research on the cooling effect of urban green and blue infrastructure based on the practical needs of urban planning and design: (1) The cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure on city and block scale should be connected to determine key heat mitigation parameters of GBI planning and design, and furthermore provide quantitative indicators for urban green space system planning; (2) The multi-dimensional of the horizontal distribution and vertical transmission spaces on the cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure studies should be integrated, and the characteristics of blocks should be combined to determine the cooling threshold for guiding and optimizing the distribution of GBI in regulatory detailed planning; (3) The pivotal indicators and thresholds of each plant or plant community configurations in heat mitigation should be determined for guiding the plant cooling design on site scale. Further multi-scale and multi-dimensional research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the planning and design of urban green and blue infrastructure in urban growth strategies, and warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the urban heat islands and enhance climate resilience. © 2021 Science Press.

The present study aims to present a game theoretical approach to the optimal bidding strategies for demand response (DR) aggregators in deregulated energy market. This model is based on the customer benefit function and price elasticity so that an economic responsive load model is applied to DR implementation. In this paper, the interaction between a system operator and aggregators in a deregulated market is modeled in this paper, where DR aggregator provides DR service to the system operator. It is assumed that a system operator collects bids from DR aggregators and determines each aggregator share in the demand response programs by maximizing its revenue function, and also, offers rewards to DR aggregators to reach this goal. On the other hand, DR aggregators compete together to offer their DR services to the network operator and in this way provide compensation for customers. The competition between DR aggregator participants is modeled as a noncooperative game considering incomplete information. This game is solved using the Nash equilibrium idea.

6863500,"River Segmentation Of Remote Sensing Images Based On Composite Attention Network","River segmentation of remote sensing images is of important research significance and application value for environmental monitoring, disaster warning, and agricultural planning in an area. In this study, we propose a river segmentation model in remote sensing images based on composite attention network to solve the problems of abundant river details in images and the interference of non-river information including bridges, shadows, and roads. To improve the segmentation efficiency, a composite attention mechanism is firstly introduced in the central region of the network to obtain the global feature dependence of river information. Next, in this study, we dynamically combine binary cross-entropy loss that is designed for pixel-wise segmentation and the Dice coefficient loss that measures the similarity of two segmentation objects into a weighted one to optimize the training process of the proposed segmentation network. The experimental results show that compared with other semantic segmentation networks, the evaluation indexes of the proposed method are higher than those of others, and the river segmentation effect of CoANet model is significantly improved. This method can segment rivers in remote sensing images more accurately and coherently, which can meet the needs of subsequent research.","{""Chen, Yunjie"",""Fan, Zhiyong"",""Hou, Jianmin"",""Yan, Fei"",""Zang, Qiang""}","10.1155/2022/7750281",2024-07-16 23:41:26,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{""algorithm is valued""}",NA
6691647,"Weather service chain analysis (WSCA) - An approach for appraisal of the social-economic benefits of improvements in weather services","The so-called Cost-Loss approach for the assessment of the economic benefits of weather forecasts is less suitable for assessing the benefits for user groups among which uncertainty about the uptake and utilization of the information is significant. Most road users can be counted to these groups. Assessment of the benefits of (improvements in) weather services for road users faces several attribution problems which may entail both over- and underestimation of these benefits. In FMI an approach has been developed which aims to account for these uncertainties by means of decomposition of the information flow ranging from forecast generation to benefit realization, i.e. so-called weather service chain analysis (WCSA). This approach can be used both in a quantitative and in a qualitative fashion. The qualitative version is meant to support information management and to identify improvement options in each section of the weather service chain. In the quantitative version the product sum of ratings per step (compared to the maximum score) is established. The quantitative version helps to identify those segments of the chain for which improvements will have the highest social-economic pay-off. It also helps to identify actions that raise the leverage of investments in weather forecast improvement. The WSCA method can be embedded in the economic modelling of particular sectors, such as (road) transport. WSCA also incites to develop regular surveying of user groups and weather service use.

6862926,"Prediction Of Blueberry (Vaccinium Corymbosum L.) Yield Based On Artificial Intelligence Methods","In this paper, we present a high-accuracy model for blueberry yield prediction, trained using structurally innovative data sets. Blueberries are blooming plants, valued for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Yield on the plantations depends on several factors, both internal and external. Predicting the accurate amount of harvest is an important aspect in work planning and storage space selection. Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in such prediction tasks, since they are capable of finding correlations between various factors at play. Overall data were collected from years 2016–2021, and included agronomic, climatic and soil data as well satellite-imaging vegetation data. Additionally, growing periods according to BBCH scale and aggregates were taken into account. After extensive data preprocessing and obtaining cumulative features, a total of 11 models were trained and evaluated. Chosen classifiers were selected from state-of-the-art methods in similar applications. To evaluate the results, Mean Absolute Percentage Error was chosen. It is superior to alternatives, since it takes into account absolute values, negating the risk that opposite variables will cancel out, while the final result outlines percentage difference between the actual value and prediction. Regarding the research presented, the best performing solution proved to be Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, with MAPE value equal to 12.48%. This result meets the requirements of practical applications, with sufficient accuracy to improve the overall yield management process.

6862894,"Mapping Wetland Areas Using Landsat-Derived Ndvi And Lswi: A Case Study Of West Songnen Plain, Northeast China","Increasing interest in wetlands for environmental management requires an understanding of the location, spatial extent, and configuration of the resource. The National Wetlands Inventory is the most commonly used data source for this information. However, its accuracy is limited in some contexts, such as agricultural and forested wetlands. An large number of studies have mapped wetlands worldwide from the perspective of land use and land cover change. However, information on the actual wetland planting areas annually is limited, which greatly impacts ongoing research. In this case study of the West Songnen Plain, we developed a simple algorithm for the quick mapping of wetlands by utilizing their unique physical features, such as annual display of phenological land-cover change of exposed soils, shallow flooding water, and plants from multi-temporal Landsat images. Temporal variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) derived from Landsat images in 2010 for wetlands at different growth stages were analyzed. Results show that during the ante-tillering phase, the NDVI value (above zero) is lower than the LSWI value of paddies because of flooding of shallow water; during the reproductive and ripening phases, the NDVI value is higher than the LSWI value (above zero); and during the post-harvest wetland planting phase, the NDVI value is still higher than the LSWI value, but the LSWI value is negative. Wetland areas can be detected using one or two images in the optimum time window. The algorithm based on the difference of NDVI and LSWI values derived from Landsat images was used to extract the actual wetland planting area. Validated alongside statistical data, the algorithm showed high accuracy. Therefore, this algorithm highlights the unique features of wetlands and can help in mapping the actual wetland area annually on a regional scale. Results further indicate that the new method has a classification accuracy of 92 \%. In comparison, two traditional methods based on Landsat-7/ETM registered accuracy rates of only 83 \% and 87 \% respectively.","{""Ding, Zhi"",""Dong, Zhangyu"",""Jia, Mingming"",""Li, Lin"",""Liu, Dianwei"",""Song, Kaishan"",""Wang, Zongming""}","10.1007/s12524-013-0357-1",2024-07-17 19:34:56,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{calibration}","{""Wetland mapping; Land surface water index (LSWI); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); The""}"

According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989–2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA,"10.1007/s10661-021-09041-x",2024-09-27 18:41:50,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863262,"Analysing Factors Influencing Fire Frequency In Hwange National Park","Detection of key factors driving fire frequency, especially in protected areas, is important for effective management of ecosystems. In this study, we used Generalized Linear Models to test the contribution of natural (NDVI, wind speed, dry matter productivity, soil moisture, percentage tree cover, elevation and temperature) and anthropogenic (distance from settlements) factors as predictors of fire frequency in Hwange National Park and adjacent areas. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate the variable contribution to fire frequency. The model results indicated that all the variables that were used contributed significantly to fire recurrence (p < 0.05). Distance from settlements contributed the most to the model whilst dry matter productivity and annual average temperature were second and third respectively. Removal of distance from settlements from the model increased the AIC value to 1411.2 while removal of dry matter productivity and temperature resulted in AICs of 1269.9 and 1265.8 respectively. Results showed that settlements which are found in the vicinity of the protected area influence the recurrence of fires. Findings from this study can be used for strategic fire management and for the development of effective measures to minimize fire recurrence in a protected area.","{""Kavhu, Blessing"",""Ndaimani, Henry""}","10.1080/03736245.2021.1941219",2024-07-17 21:52:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Fire frequency; remote sensing; generalized linear modelling; protected areas; savanna""}"
6903610,"The Economic Impact Of Tourism In Central Finland: A Regional Input-Output Study","Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional taxes in Central Finland. Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central Finland are quite significant. Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings, consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism jobs are often low paying. Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries. Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism impact studies using the input-output technique have also been conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers involved in regional planning and development.",NA,"10.1108/tr-04-2017-0080",2024-10-03 22:27:00,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA

6862737,"Nature-Based Solutions (Nbs) For Sustainable Development Of The Resource Base And Ecosystem Services Of Marine And Coastal Ecosystems Of India","The imminent dangers due to increasing anthropogenic stress on the coastal seas, as well as marine pollution in the Anthropocene, have highlighted the need to devise and adopt novel eco-sustainable solutions through the use of technology for India. Special emphasis on the use of scientifically derived marine fishery advisories (MFAs) can have multiple co-benefits with the utilization of nature-based solutions (NbS) for monitoring and management of coastal and marine resource bases. Such co-management options can be effective to realize the targets for Sustainable Development Goals 14 (SDG 14) for 2030. At present, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides the MFAs on a daily basis by using a combination of data from satellite imageries and ground-based datasets. However, sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems services needs to be informed by appropriate technological models of resources usage, including the incorporation of coastal zone management plans as per NbS frameworks for achieving long-term successes. The present study highlights the need to adopt NbS and MFAs as co-management approaches for adaptation and/or mitigation of the impacts of climatic and environmental factors as well as for fostering sustainable fishing initiatives for the Bay of Bengal. Such integrative methodologies are crucial for the development of model-based policy frameworks for sustainable marine resources management. Accordingly, an assessment of the NbS techniques for deriving a new adaptive framework is presented and discussed in the context of consideration of MFAs as NbS Assisting Technologies (NAT) to obtain significant co-benefits for sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","{""Kundu, S.

6903505,"Sub-Nyquist Sampling And Measurement Of Mpsk Signal Based On Parameter Matching","Accurate measurement of the M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signal determined by finite parameters per unit of time is significant in engineering fields, such as digital microwave and satellite communication. In this article, we propose a sub-Nyquist sampling system with two channels for measuring characteristic parameters of MPSK signals based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) sampling theory. The carrier frequency parameter measurement process is modeled as a convex optimization problem, solvable using the parameter matching method on the estimated grid. The minimum harmonic frequency of the carrier is determined to build the exact grid, and the carrier frequency is estimated through a greedy search based on the given cost function. Even when the truth value of the carrier frequency is unknown, the discontinuity location parameters can be measured with high precision using the spectral estimation method on the Fourier coefficients of the MPSK signal. We propose an upper bound on the estimation error of this separable measurement method for signals with one segment. The amplitude and phase parameters can be measured by solving a least square problem. Our proposed measurement system, with lower hardware complexity, can accurately measure the MPSK signal with K segments by sampling only 2K + 5 points in a period, at a much lower sampling rate than the carrier frequency. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our state-of-the-art measurement method. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",NA,"10.1109/tim.2023.3261930",2024-10-03 21:51:11,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862964,"How Safe Is The Safety Paradigm?","This paper reviews safety initiatives in the health systems of the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US. Initiatives to tackle safety shortcomings involve public-private collaborations. Patient safety agencies (to institute learning, action and safety culture), adverse event reporting and, to a lesser extent, safety related performance indicators are currently used to design safer health systems. Their benefits are mixed, but there is little debate as to their possible side effects. Foreseeable adverse effects of multiple safety organisations stem from them being too many, too vague, too narrowly focused, threatened by the medical practice environment, and too optimistic. Safety related performance indicators are most developed in the US but suffer from inadequacies of administrative data, underreporting, variable indicator definitions, ""extended"" use, and low sensitivity of the diagnosis coding system, and arguable preventability of the prescribed conditions. A critical appraisal of the implications of these deficiencies is important to assure the safety of current health system safety initiatives and to establish evidence based safety. It is necessary to embed health system safety (as well as patient safety) in the societal culture, structures, and policies which promote effective, user centred, high performance care while allowing for healthy innovation.","{""Arah, O.

6863145,"Synchronization, Decoupling, And Regime Shift Of Urban Thermal Conditions In Xi'an, An Ancient City In China Under Rapid Expansion","Urbanization has profound impacts on economic development and environmental quality. Some of the serious consequences of urbanization are the changes in the thermal environment, which directly affect the greater environment and quality of life. Although many studies have been performed on urban heat islands, few have specifically examined the thermal evolution of rapidly expanding ancient cities and the impacts of urbanization on the thermal environments of important heritage sites. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of the thermal environment quantified as the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and land surface temperature (LST) values from 2000 to 2018 in Xi'an, an ancient city with rich cultural heritage in China. Specifically, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the thermal environments of the functional zones and heritage sites and explore their coupling relationships with the overall temperature of the study area using a statistical analysis approach. Furthermore, we revealed time-sensitive changes in temperature regimes using the newly proposed double temperature curve approach (DTCA). The results showed that the heat island phenomenon has been intensifying in Xi'an, as evidenced by the summer daytime mean SUHI values being greater than 7 degrees C continuously since 2010 and the increased frequency of high-intensity SUHI effects. Extreme heat conditions were more frequent in the old urban area (built-up and in existence before 2000) than in the new urban area, while SUHI values in the new area deteriorated more rapidly. The changes in temperature in the functional zones were strongly synchronized with the overall temperature changes in Xi'an, and the temperature differences increased linearly with the overall temperature. The LST values in the four major historical heritage sites investigated in this study were 2-8 degrees C higher than the background temperature and were decoupled from background temperature changes. From the DTCA, we found the time periods of the thermal environment regime changes for each functional zone or heritage site, which were largely the result of policy guidance. Regional synchronization, site decoupling, and regime shifts in LST suggest opportunities for regional planning and urban landscape optimization to reduce adverse effects of urbanization on the urban environment, particularly in cities with rich historical heritage sites.","{""Guo, Rui"",""Li, Yuanyuan"",""Liu, Shuguang"",""Shi, Yi"",""Wu, Yiping"",""Yuan, Wenping"",""Zhao, Shuqing""}","10.3390/rs14112586",2024-09-27 23:00:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""urban thermal environment; urban heat island; regional synchronization; site decoupling; time series""}"
6862911,"Extracting Tea Plantations Based On Zy-3 Satellite Data","Tea is the most consumed natural plant drink in the world, and it plays an important role in human's daily life. The spatial distribution information of tea plantation is helpful for the government management and decision-making. Songyang county is located in southwest part of Zhejiang province, China, and the topography is characterized by basin in the central and surrounded by hills and mountains. The humid and cloudy climate is very suitable for tea planting, which accounts for the large proportion of tea plantation area, 68.5% of county's whole cultivated land. In this paper, ZhangXi Town, ZhaiTan Town, YeCun Town and ZhuYuan Town of SongYang County in Zhejiang Province were chosen as study area, and ZY-3 satellite images acquired on December 25, 2012 and June 9, 2013 were used to study the method of tea plantations extraction. Eight categories including roads, water, buildings, shadows, bare soil, forest, other crops and tea plantation were identified after conducting visual interpretation and field surveys. The decision tree method was adopted to extract the tea plantations. Due to the fact that tea plants in plain areas and mountains areas show different characteristics in their planting patterns, planting area and growth status,, the decision trees were built separately for these two different areas. The threshold values in the decision tree were determined by gradually changing their values in a certain range. Spectral curve analysis shows the range of the difference between band4 (0.77-0.89 μm) and band3 (0.63-0.69 μm) on December 25, 2012 is 20-30. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is almost unchanged or decreased from summer to winter for forest lands as they are covered mainly by evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, bamboo forest and mixed forest. As for tea plant, due to its seasonal harvest and pruning in summer, NDVI in summer is a little lower than that in winter and the threshold value of NDVI difference between summer (June 9, 2013) and winter (December 25, 2012) was 0~0.1.As tea plants are terraced planted along the contour in mountain area, texture features characterized with nearly parallel line trend for tea plantations are presented in the image. The panchromatic data on December 25, 2012 was used to derive texture features. Anisotropic strength with a range of 0 to 1 was obtained after conducting the anisotropic strength algorithm. The classification results with different threshold values were compared with region-of-interest data and threshold values with the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were selected as final threshold. For plain areas, the difference between band4 and band3 was used to roughly exclude roads, water, buildings, bare soil, other crops and part of the forest from tea plantations with the value above 26.Then the threshold value of 0 for NDVI difference between summer and winter was adopted to exclude the remaining forest. Spectral feature and textural feature were both used to extract tea plantations in mountainous areas. The threshold value of 20 for band4 and band3 difference and 0 for NDVI difference between summer and winter were firstly adopted to exclude water, buildings, crops, roads, bare soil and part of forest. And the threshold of 0.35 for anisotropic strength was then adopted to exclude the remaining forest. The classification maps were validated with ground verification data and compared with results derived from neural network (NN) classification. The results show that decision tree method combining with spectral and textural information can significantly improve the classification accuracy. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the plain area were 95.00% and 0.85, respectively, increased by 5.46% and 0.19 when compared with NN classification. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the mountain area were 92.97% and 0.69, respectively, increased by 7.57% and 0.61 when compared with NN classification.

6863059,"The Relationship Of Spatial-Temporal Changes In Fringe Mangrove Extent And Adjacent Land-Use: Case Study Of Kien Giang Coast, Vietnam","Fringe mangroves are recognised as a highly valuable resource due to their provision of multiple ecosystem services. However, accelerating human-pressures on mangrove forests are resulting in the loss of key mangrove ecosystem services. In this paper, we assessed spatial-temporal changes in the extent and width of fringe mangroves, and changes in adjacent land use. The study focused on the Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, for the period 1989-2009. The total mangrove extent was estimated at seven points in tithe using four Landsat TM images (1989, 1992, 2003, and 2006) and three SPOT images (1995, 2003 and 2009). Supervised classification was conducted for image classification and mapping changes using a Maximum Livelihood Classifier approach. Changes in mangrove width were calculated for 2003 and 2009 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis Application. An assessment of the four Landsat TM images showed a significant decrease in mangrove extent for the periods 1989-1992 (-2.7\% yr(-1)) and 2003-2006 (-2.1\% yr(-1)), while a significant increase in mangrove extent was observed during 1992-2003 (0.7\% yr(-1)). SPOT images were used to classify shoreline land cover into four types, namely mangroves; shrimp farms; built-up areas; and bare and wet ground areas. The total loss of fringe mangrove extent was significantly correlated with the increase in extent of other land covers, especially shrimp farms and bare and wet ground, during the period of 2003-2009. The overall accuracy assessment of the classification using 2003 and 2009 SPOT 5 images was 90.1\% and 90.5\% respectively. The overall accuracy assessment of the 2003 Landsat image was 92.1\%. This accuracy in classification of mangroves and non-mangroves showed that use of Landsat images was adequate for assessing spatial-temporal mangrove dynamics when higher spatial resolution satellite images were limited. The results highlight the dynamic nature of fringe mangrove communities in the region, and provide data useful for informing shoreline mangrove rehabilitation, conservation efforts, and national monitoring programs for estimating mangrove values of carbon sequestration and shoreline protection functions in Vietnam.

6862760,"Impact Of Peri-Urban Forest Fires On Air Quality And Aerosol Optical And Chemical Properties: The Case Of The August 2021 Wildfires In Athens, Greece","Wildfires occurring near urban areas are known to have exceedingly detrimental impacts on the environment, air quality, economy and human health. In this framework, this study examines the effects of peri-urban forest fires on atmospheric chemical composition, and aerosol physical-optical properties in Athens, Greece, during August 2021. Satellite imagery and air mass trajectories showed advection of intense smoke plumes over Athens from three forest fires persisting for 10 days in the greater Athens area and in Central Greece (Euboea). During August 1–20, 2021, daily PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 8.9 to 78.7 μg m−3, and were associated with high OC levels (2.3–27.8 μg m−3), while BC and BCbb concentrations on smoke-impacted days were 2.6 μg m−3 and 1.0 μg m−3, respectively (2–3 times higher than August mean levels). During the peak of biomass burning (BB) smoke transport over Athens, daily-average scattering and absorption coefficients at short wavelengths maximized at 313 Mm−1 and 171 Mm−1, respectively. There was also a large impact of ambient BrC (brown carbon) absorption (60 Mm−1), while the OC/EC ratio exhibited characteristically low values (3–4), linked to flaming combustion (modified combustion efficiency of 0.97–0.99). The absorption Ångström exponent (1.38) and single scattering albedo (0.74) indicated highly absorbing BB aerosol, deviating from the normal summer patterns. BB-tracers like nss–K+ displayed strong correlations with OC, EC and BC concentrations, as well as with scattering and absorption coefficients. However, forest fires drastically modified the levels of additional chemical species, with enhancements observed for Ca2+, NO3−, Cl−, and for organic aerosol (OA) components such as BBOA and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Since under climate change conditions, the Mediterranean is anticipated to experience a dramatic rise in the frequency and intensity of wildfires, the results highlight the necessity for prevention and mitigation policies to safeguard urban air quality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","{""Bougiatioti, A."",""Gerasopoulos, E."",""Grivas, G."",""Kalkavouras, P."",""Kaskaoutis, D.

GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage of approximately -27.2 +/- 0.6 mm yr^-1 equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 143.6 km^3 during the course of the study period. Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of ‘‘best current capabilities’’ in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3 +/- 2.1 mm yr^-1 equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3 +/-10.9 km^3 in volume.

6863682,"Water Harvesting In The Garmian Region (Kurdistan, Iraq) Using Gis And Remote Sensing","Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the essential alternative sources of water that may be used. However, finding potential RWH locations on a broad scale has always been challenging, requiring further research. The effectiveness of RWH structures depends on their design and the selection of suitable sites. This study aimed to select potential sites for rainwater harvesting in the Garmian region of Kurdistan-Iraq, using GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. Two multicriteria analysis (MCA) techniques: the analytical hierarchal process (AHP) and Fuzzy analytical hierarchal process (FAHP) were used for comparison purposes to identify potential RWH sites. A suitability map of potential RWH systems was then generated following the weighted linear combination (WLC) and the Fuzzy Gamma methods. The outcomes showed that, unlike most recent studies, which relied on the minimum and maximum local rainfall values, a minimum agreed-upon rainfall depth should be used as a benchmark when classifying rainfall to obtain realistic results. The findings also showed that 9.7\%, 43.4\%, 33.6\%, and 13.3\% of the sites have very high, high, moderate, and low suitability for rainwater harvesting, respectively, depending on the suitability map produced by the WLC method. However, the outcome of the Fuzzy Gamma technique appeared more realistic and revealed that 10.6\%, 15.6\%, 26.6\%, 21.9\%, and 25.3\% of the sites have very high, high, moderate, low, and very low appropriateness for rainwater harvesting, respectively. The methods adopted in this study can be helpful for researchers in the field of RWH to achieve reliable results. Also, this study's findings can assist in well-organized water resource management planning to ensure sustainable water development in the Garmian region.","{""Abdulrahman, Kawa Z."",""Ali, Salahaldin S."",""Aziz, Shvan F."",""Karakouzian, Moses""}","10.3390/w15030507",2024-09-30 01:54:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2023,"{}","{""RWH; AHP; WLC; Garmian region; criteria""}"
6863170,"The Global Atmospheric Environment For The Next Generation","Air quality, ecosystem exposure to nitrogen deposition, and climate change are intimately coupled problems: we assess changes in the global atmospheric environment between 2000 and 2030 using 26 state-of-the-art global atmospheric chemistry models and three different emissions scenarios. The first (CLE) scenario reflects implementation of current air quality legislation around the world, while the second (MFR) represents a more optimistic case in which all currently feasible technologies are applied to achieve maximum emission reductions. We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO2 satellite observations. Large parts of the world are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems. By 2030, global surface ozone is calculated to increase globally by 1.5 +/- 1.2 ppb (CLE) and 4.3 +/- 2.2 ppb (A2), using the ensemble mean model results and associated +/- 1 sigma standard deviations. Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by -2.3 +/- 1.1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by -0.8 +/- 0.6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 +/- 15 and 155 +/- 37 mW m(-2) for CLE and A2, respectively, and decreases by -45 +/- 15 mW m(-2) for MFR. We compute that at present 10.1\% of the global natural terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to nitrogen deposition above a critical load of 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1). These percentages increase by 2030 to 15.8\% (CLE), 10.5\% (MFR), and 25\% (A2). This study shows the importance of enforcing current worldwide air quality legislation and the major benefits of going further. Nonattainment of these air quality policy objectives, such as expressed by the SRES-A2 scenario, would further degrade the global atmospheric environment.","{""Amann, M."",""Atherton, C."",""Bell, N."",""Bergmann, D."",""Bey, I."",""Bouwman, L."",""Butler, T."",""Cofala, J."",""Collins, B."",""Dentener, F."",""Doherty, R."",""Drevet, J."",""Eickhout, B."",""Ellingsen, K."",""Eskes, H."",""Fiore, A."",""Gauss, M."",""Hauglustaine, D."",""Horowitz, L."",""Isaksen, I.

6862896,"Satellite Detection Of Earlier Wheat Sowing In India And Implications For Yield Trends","Wheat is a staple crop throughout much of India, but in many areas it is commonly sown past the optimum window for yields. Recent technologies, such as adoption of no-till practices or earlier maturing cotton and rice varieties, have enabled some farmers to sow wheat earlier, but repeatable and publicly available measurements of sow date trends are lacking. Here we utilize satellite measurements since 2000 to estimate sow dates over a decade throughout wheat growing areas in India. Comparisons with ground-based sow dates in Punjab confirmed the reliability of satellite estimates, and data from two independent satellite sensors were used as a robustness check. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) shifts toward earlier sowing of wheat throughout much of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, with insignificant changes in Punjab. A production-weighted average of the entire region indicates that, on average, wheat was sown 1 week earlier by 2010 than it was at the beginning of the decade. Using previously published experimental estimates of yield gains from earlier sowing, we estimate that an overall yield gain of at least 5\% averaged across India can be explained by the sow date trend. Given that national yield changes since 2000 have been less than 5\%, our results indicate that the sow date shift has been a major factor in yield changes over the past decade, and that the net yield effect of all factors other than sow date has been close to zero, perhaps even negative. The results also indicate that sow dates in much of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are nearing or already at the optimum window for yields, so that yield benefits from sow date shifts will likely diminish in the next decade.

6691636,"A performance, semantic and service qualityenhanced distributed search engine for improving geospatial resource discovery","Geospatial resource discovery is a critical step for developing geographic science applications. With the increasing number of geospatial resources available online, many Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) components (e.g. catalogues and portals) have been developed to help manage and discover geospatial resources. However, efficient and accurate geospatial resource discovery is still a big challenge because of the heterogeneity and complexity of decentralized network environments and interdisciplinary semantics. In this article, we report a search engine framework for efficient geospatial resource discovery, which reduces integration costs by leveraging existing Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) components. Specifically, (1) the framework provides integration capability and flexibility by adopting the brokering approach, implementing a ‘plug-in’-based framework for metadata processing and proposing a dynamically configurable search workflow; (2) the asynchronous messaging and batch processing-based metadata record retrieval mode enhances the search performance and user interactivity; (3) an embedded semantic support system improves the discovery recall level and precision by providing semantic-based search rule creation and result similarity evaluation functions and (4) the engine assists user decision-making by integrating a service quality monitoring and evaluation system, data/service visualization tools, multiple views and additional information. Experiments and a search example show that the proposed engine helps both scientists and general users search for more accurate results with enhanced performance and user experience through a user-friendly interface.","{""Gui, Zhipeng""}","https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2012.739692",2024-04-28 01:01:22,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{}","{""CyberGIS|spatial cloud computing|spatial web portal|data discovery|EarthCube""}"
6863638,"Biodiversity Mapping","The term 'biodiversity mapping' encompasses a variety of techniques and methodological approaches in identifying and analyzing patterns in plant and animal distributions. Biodiversity mapping is usually a precursor to attempts to protect biodiversity, and is often undertaken in efforts to assess the conservation value of different areas. Usually this work is done to provide a means of prioritizing one area over another for protection. Methods of assessing conservation value are highly contested and have led to several distinct approaches to biodiversity mapping. Traditionally, conservation approaches have typically been focused at the species level. In light of the complex interconnections within and between ecosystems, however, many conservation practitioners are turning toward habitat- or landscape-level approaches, and making increasing use of cartographic techniques to assist with data representation and decision - making - biodiversity mapping. Recent developments in geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing have assisted this shift by facilitating the compilation and analysis of large amounts of complex spatial data. Despite these advances, a lack of sound baseline data remains one of the major challenges in biodiversity mapping. Most biodiversity maps must, therefore, rely on proxy measures of biodiversity to cover these data gaps. Considerable controversy exists over how best to select such proxies and how to deal with error and uncertainty more broadly in biodiversity mapping projects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

6863512,"On The Absurdity Of Rapid Urbanization: Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Land-Use Changes In Morogoro, Tanzania","This study questions the frequent overemphasis on population growth aspects of African urbanization with little consideration of the spatial extent by analyzing the influence of population growth on the spatial expansion of the Morogoro urban municipality (MUM) in Tanzania between 2000 and 2016. Shannon's Entropy, a random forest supervised classifier, and spatial analysis were adopted to analyze Multi-temporal Landsat images obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and pattern of land-use change. Findings from this research show that Shannon's entropy values for MUM increased from 0.522 in 2000, to 0.761 in 2007, and to 0.901 in 2016 with the urban land cover recording a considerable and consistent increase. Similarly, the municipality's annual rate of change in population decreased from 4.17\% in 1967 to 3.81\% in 2016, and is estimated to rise to 4.54\% by 2030 with a corresponding population of 25,262 in 1967 and 622,000 in 2016. From the results, the rate of population growth is not commensurate with the rate of spatial expansion, as the spatial extent is more than twice the population growth. An important contribution from this research relates to the limited attention to the faster rate of urban expansion compared to population growth in African cities; a situation that is inconsistent with sustainable and resilient urban futures. It is recommended that municipal authorities should consider initiatives (e.g., environmental planning models) to reverse the current trend of urban growth in order to improve the health, density, sustainability and resilience of the urban environment.","{""Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful"",""Sumari, Neema Simon"",""Ujoh, Fanan"",""Xu, Gang""}","10.1016/j.cities.2020.102876",2024-10-03 20:57:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Land-use; Land cover; Urban expansion; Spatio-temporal pattern; Morogoro""}"
6863083,"Burned Area Mapping For Heilongjiang Basin Based On Modis Time Series Data","Fire is an important natural disturbance that affects several ecosystems and is also one of the main factors of the terrestrial carbon cycle. As fire modifies the structure and composition of vegetation, it is considered to be an important land management tool. Burned area mapping is an essential step in forest fire research to investigate the relationship between forest fire and climate change and the effect of forest fire on carbon budgets. Traditional data collection of forest fires in field-which are statistically recorded are difficult to manipulate over a large area. The development of the remote sensing technique provides a labor-efficient method for research of land surface processes. At the regional or global scale, in order to obtain a long-time series of burned area maps, a moderate spatial resolution with high temporal resolution remote sensing data is considered as the best alternative. Currently, the most widely used remote sensing data are Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Although the AVHRR provides continuous observations for burned area analyses, some studies have identified several sources of potential errors in burned area discrimination from this sensor, mainly due to its radiometric instability, cloud obscuration, and transmission problems. Most of these problems have been notably reduced in the MODIS sensor, which offers greater spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolution than the AVHRR. This study proposes an algorithm to map areas burned by forest fire using MODIS time series data in Heilongjiang Valley, China. The algorithm is divided into two steps: First, the “core冶pixels were extracted to represent the most possible burned pixels based on a comparison of the temporal change of the Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), the Burned Area Index (BAI), and the MODIS active fire products between pre-and post-fire spatial patterns. Second, a 15-km distance was set to extract the entire burned area near the “core"" pixels. These more relaxed conditions were used to identify the fire pixels for reducing the omission error as much as possible. The algorithm comprehensively considered the thermal characteristics and the spectral change between pre-and post-fire spatial patterns, which were represented by the MODIS fire products and the spectral index, respectively. Heilongjiang province in China was selected as the typical study area to validate the accuracy of the algorithm. The results showed that with the use of the MODIS fire products, the accuracy of the algorithm was improved, with an overall accuracy of 71% and a highest accuracy of 84%. Consequently, the algorithm used in this study produced a long-time series of burned area maps of the study area from 2000 to 2011 with a relatively high accuracy. According to the burned area maps, the study area has been seriously affected by fire disasters on average of 0.53 million ha of burned land each year. The most affected years were 2003 and 2008 with burned areas exceeding 1 million ha. The least affected year was 2010 with a burned area of just 0.18 million ha. The relatively large disparity between the maximum and minimum values of the areas burned by forest fire indicates that there is a fluctuation in the severity of disaster during the studied period. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

Environmental Intelligence brings together multiple data streams (facts) from ground-based, satellite and citizen sources with cutting-edge hardware, software and analytical technology employing human reasoning and machine learning to better understand and manage the environment. The EC H2020 ReSET project (Restarting Economy in Support of Environment through Technology) funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 FET Proactive Programme under grant agreement No 101017857, brings together environmental scientists, social scientists, informatics specialists and stakeholders from five European countries to develop state of the art investment policy support systems. These combine the best available earth observation, crowdsourced and field-monitored data with sophisticated spatial policy support systems for biophysical and social processes. Harnessing combined machine and human intelligence, we seek to to understand best-bet options for 'build back better' investments that maximise environmental, economic and employment benefits. We are working at a series of demonstration sites in Europe where 'build back better' investments are active: Thames Gateway, OxCam Arc and Strand Aldwych in UK; Carasuhat Wetlands in Romania; Castilla Leon and Rivas VaciaMadrid in Spain and Bologna in Italy. Proposed investments include urban greening and traffic management to reduce air pollution and thermal extremes (Strand Aldwych, Bologna, Rivas Vaciamadrid); Natural Flood Management (Thames Gateway, OxCam Arc, Castilla-Leon), land use zoning for low impact tourism (Carasuhat) and green-grey approaches to flood and drought management (Castilla Leon). We bring together new hardware technologies enabling low-cost, distributed, IoT environmental monitoring using the FreeStation.org platform with further developments of our widely used policy support systems CotingNature and Eco:Actuary and enhanced activity and agent-based modelling in the Metronamica modelling framework. This is to better understand current environmental conditions in the areas proposed for investment and to simulate the impact of investment alternatives (business as usual grey, blended grey-green and fully green) on environment, economy and employment in the ReSET investment policy support system. Through this work, we tackle some key challenges of operationalizing environmental intelligence discussed here: • technology as an enabler of research and innovation rather than the key focus of research • live integration of complex data streams • ensuring usability and ease of use through co-design • scalability and relevance to a range of investment types and settings • reducing costs, enabling local maintenance and ensuring accessibility and legacy © 2021 ACM.","{""Burke, S."",""Douglas, C."",""Giordano, R."",""Lopez-Gunn, E."",""Mulligan, M."",""Scrieciu, A."",""Shi, M."",""Van Delden, H."",""Van Soesbergen, A.""}","10.1145/3462203.3475916",2024-04-11 22:10:06,"excluded","{""Value is not measured""}",2021,"{cco}","{""Autonomous agents"",""Computational methods"",Economic,Economics,""Environmental intelligence"",""Environmental technology"",""Flood control"",""Flood management"",Floods,""Green infrastructure"",""Hardware technology"",""Infrastructure investment"",Investment,""Investment policies"",Investments,""Land use"",""Machine learning"",""Nature based solution"",""Nature based solutions"",""Policy support"",""Simulation platform"",""Support systems"",""Sustainable development"",""Sustainable infrastructure"",""social effects""}"
6903527,"Identifying Causal Changes In Landscape Greenness With Very High-Resolution Airborne Multispectral Imagery And A Panel Data Model","To effectively manage urban environmental systems, interventions on private lands may sometimes be necessary. This is illustrated in many water districts where water agencies run programs that provide incentives to landholders to change their landscaping to meet the water agency's management goals. It is difficult to monitor, track, and evaluate landscape change programs on private land, however. To most efficiently do so, very high-resolution, time-series measurements of urban landcover would be useful, but such data is often unavailable. This study evaluates how private urban landscape change is represented in the highest resolution, publicly available, multispectral data product distributed in the United States. The study focuses on residential parcels that participated in a lawn replacement rebate program run by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, a water agency in California. Each parcel has a known quantity of turfgrass converted to drought-tolerant landscaping. The study asks if Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data can be used to detect participation in a lawn replacement program at the parcel-level. While the NAIP data product has substantial error in a time-series and urban context, this study finds that approaching change detection using a fixed effect panel data model accommodates error, making it possible to identify NDVI change. With control groups defined by matching and weighing with Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores, results indicate that observed browning at the parcel-level can be causally attributed to participating in the lawn replacement program. This ability to detect small, causal changes in a heterogenous environment opens possibilities for monitoring and evaluating programs acting on private urban landscapes, contributing to more effective and efficient design, pricing and implementation. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",NA,"10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127380",2024-10-03 21:49:58,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863350,"Sustainability Of Groundwater","Groundwater fills and flows in the pore-space, fractures, and conduits of geological formations beneath the Earth’s surface, called aquifers. Groundwater is the Earth’s largest non-frozen freshwater reservoir, accounting for more than 97% of the liquid freshwater stock. Groundwater is the world’s most extracted natural resource with withdrawal rates in the range of 1000km3/year, and about 70% of the pumped groundwater is used for agriculture worldwide. Groundwater is a reliable freshwater resource that moves slowly in the aquifer, providing vital benefits for billions of people worldwide. Groundwater supplies more than half of the drinking water; helps to grow food by supplying approximately 40% of irrigation water; accounts for about one third of freshwater supply for industrial activities; and supports groundwater dependent ecosystems in aquifers, soil, rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal zones, and marine environments, providing numerous ecosystem services. In addition, groundwater is a geothermal energy resource, which can be used for heating and cooling in urban heat islands as an example. Moreover, groundwater can generally serve as a manageable buffer to droughts, surface water seasonal variations, and floods. However, there are growing concerns over unsustainable groundwater pumping exceeding natural and induced recharge along with groundwater contamination and salinization, and degradation of groundwater dependent ecosystems. For example, more than half of the largest aquifers on Earth are being depleted, given estimates derived from the GRACE satellite mission (Richey et al., 2015). In addition, sustainable management of groundwater resources is critical for climate adaptation strategies, as climate change and variability drive the aquifer recharge, and can change groundwater use. As the world population is nearing 8 billion, these essential benefits and growing concerns call for an action to ensure groundwater sustainability (Gleeson et al., 2019). This article shows that understanding the coupled water-ecology-human system in a participatory water governance framework is critical for sustainable groundwater management.

6863183,"Coastal High-Frequency Radars In The Mediterranean - Part 1: Status Of Operations And A Framework For Future Development","Due to the semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean Sea, natural disasters and anthropogenic activities impose stronger pressures on its coastal ecosystems than in any other sea of the world. With the aim of responding adequately to science priorities and societal challenges, littoral waters must be effectively monitored with high-frequency radar (HFR) systems. This land-based remote sensing technology can provide, in near-real time, fine-resolution maps of the surface circulation over broad coastal areas, along with reliable directional wave and wind information. The main goal of this work is to showcase the current status of the Mediterranean HFR network and the future roadmap for orchestrated actions. Ongoing collaborative efforts and recent progress of this regional alliance are not only described but also connected with other European initiatives and global frameworks, highlighting the advantages of this cost-effective instrument for the multi-parameter monitoring of the sea state. Coordinated endeavors between HFR operators from different multi-disciplinary institutions are mandatory to reach a mature stage at both national and regional levels, striving to do the following: (i) harmonize deployment and maintenance practices; (ii) standardize data, metadata, and quality control procedures; (iii) centralize data management, visualization, and access platforms; and (iv) develop practical applications of societal benefit that can be used for strategic planning and informed decision-making in the Mediterranean marine environment. Such fit-for-purpose applications can serve for search and rescue operations, safe vessel navigation, tracking of marine pollutants, the monitoring of extreme events, the investigation of transport processes, and the connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems. Finally, future prospects within the Mediterranean framework are discussed along with a wealth of socioeconomic, technical, and scientific challenges to be faced during the implementation of this integrated HFR regional network.","{""Aguiar, Eva"",""Bendoni, Michele"",""Berta, Maristella"",""Brandini, Carlo"",""Caceres-Euse, Alejandro"",""Capodici, Fulvio"",""Cardin, Vanessa"",""Cianelli, Daniela"",""Ciraolo, Giuseppe"",""Corgnati, Lorenzo"",""Dadic, Vlado"",""Doronzo, Bartolomeo"",""Drago, Aldo"",""Dumas, Dylan"",""Falco, Pierpaolo"",""Fattorini, Maria"",""Gauci, Adam"",""Gomez, Roberto"",""Griffa, Annalisa"",""Guerin, Charles-Antoine"",""Hernandez-Carrasco, Ismael"",""Hernandez-Lasheras, Jaime"",""Licer, Matjaz"",""Lorente, Pablo"",""Magaldi, Marcello G."",""Mantovani, Carlo"",""Mihanovic, Hrvoje"",""Molcard, Anne"",""Mourre, Baptiste"",""Orfila, Alejandro"",""Revelard, Adele"",""Reyes, Emma"",""Sanchez, Jorge"",""Saviano, Simona"",""Sciascia, Roberta"",""Taddei, Stefano"",""Tintore, Joaquin"",""Toledo, Yaron"",""Ursella, Laura"",""Uttieri, Marco"",""Vilibic, Ivica"",""Zambianchi, Enrico""}","10.5194/os-18-761-2022",2024-07-19 20:16:45,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}",NA
6863505,"Multi-Algorithm Comparison For Predicting Soil Salinity","Soil salinization is one of the most predominant processes responsible for land degradation globally. However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30\% overall samples) at three depths, 010 cm, 1030 cm, 3050 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lins concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 010 cm and 1030 cm depths, whereas for the 3050 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m-1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m-1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m-1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.","{""Biswas, Asim"",""Ding, Jianli"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wang, Fei"",""Yang, Shengtian""}","10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114211",2024-07-19 20:34:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{algorithm,calibration}","{""Soil salinization; Predictive mapping; Environmental covariates; Algorithms; Random forest""}"
6863504,"Harmonic Distortions In Smart Devices: A Comprehensive Survey From Conventional To Future Smart Iot Devices","Smart devices are playing a vital role in remote sensing and monitoring of devices over a wide range of applications. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is leading the world to the next level of technology. This helps the data transmission, monitoring, and control among devices without human intervention. The extensive utility of sensor technology and M2M networking is the future of industries for the production of commercial and non-commercial applications. One such application, the Internet of Things (IoT), is the universally accepted technology of sensors and wide area networking. The extensive use of nonlinear onboard electronic components and power converter units in smart devices generates higher-order current harmonics. This causes the severe effect of low power quality and results in device malfunctioning. The increase in the use of smart devices will be a future challenge for power quality and its effect on associative devices. The main contribution of this chapter is to analyze harmonic distortions due to nonlinear load characteristics in the power management unit of traditional systems and advanced smart IoT devices. It helps us to understand the utility of conventional harmonic mitigation techniques and the need for adaptive features for the latest technology. The conventional compensation techniques are incorporated with machine learning approaches to deal with the uncertainty of load variation on real-time signals. This survey gives a brief insight into the present scope of conventional compensation techniques and futuristic soft computing techniques to mitigate harmonic distortions. Additionally, the survey is intended to call attention to researchers of the future perspective of smart devices and to make the academic community aware of existing practices. © 2024 selection and editorial matter Gunjan Soni, Om Prakash Yadav, Gaurav Kumar Badhotiya and Mangey Ram; individual chapters, the contributors.","{""Gautam, K."",""Goswami, G."",""Goswami, P.

6862965,"Retrospective Observational Study Of Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance Data During Air Pollution Episodes Across London And Paris In 2014","Introduction Poor air quality (AQ) is a global public health issue and AQ events can span across countries. Using emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance from England and France, we describe changes in human health indicators during periods of particularly poor AQ in London and Paris during 2014. Methods Using daily AQ data for 2014, we identified three periods of poor AQ affecting both London and Paris. Anonymised near real-time ED attendance syndromic surveillance data from EDs across England and France were used to monitor the health impact of poor AQ. Using the routine English syndromic surveillance detection methods, increases in selected ED syndromic indicators (asthma, difficulty breathing and myocardial ischaemia), in total and by age, were identified and compared with periods of poor AQ in each city. Retrospective Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to identify significant increases in ED attendance data on days with (and up to 3 days following) poor AQ. Results Almost 1.5 million ED attendances were recorded during the study period (27 February 2014 to 1 October 2014). Significant increases in ED attendances for asthma were identified around periods of poor AQ in both cities, especially in children (aged 0-14 years). Some variation was seen in Paris with a rapid increase during the first AQ period in asthma attendances among children (aged 0-14 years), whereas during the second period the increase was greater in adults. Discussion This work demonstrates the public health value of syndromic surveillance during air pollution incidents. There is potential for further cross-border harmonisation to provide Europe-wide early alerting to health impacts and improve future public health messaging to healthcare services to provide warning of increases in demand. © Crown copyright 2018.

6862945,"Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes And Their Influence On The Ecosystem In Chengdu City, China During The Period Of 1992-2018","Due to urban expansion, economic development, and rapid population growth, land use/land cover (LULC) is changing in major cities around the globe. Quantitative analysis of LULC change is important for studying the corresponding impact on the ecosystem service value (ESV) that helps in decision-making and ecosystem conservation. Based on LULC data retrieved from remote-sensing interpretation, we computed the changes of ESV associated with the LULC dynamics using the benefits transfer method and geographic information system (GIS) technologies during the period of 1992-2018 following self-modified coefficients which were corrected by net primary productivity (NPP). This improved approach aimed to establish a regional value coefficients table for facilitating the reliable evaluation of ESV. The main objective of this research was to clarify the trend and spatial patterns of LULC changes and their influence on ecosystem service values and functions. Our results show a continuous reduction in total ESV from United States (US) \$1476.25 million in 1992, to US \$1410.17, \$1335.10, and \$1190.56 million in 2001, 2009, and 2018, respectively; such changes are attributed to a notable loss of farmland and forest land from 1992-2018. The elasticity of ESV in response to changes in LULC shows that 1\% of land transition may have caused average changes of 0.28\%, 0.34\%, and 0.50\% during the periods of 1992-2001, 2001-2009, and 2009-2018, respectively. This study provides important information useful for land resource management and for developing strategies to address the reduction of ESV.","{""Cao, Chunxiang"",""Chen, Wei"",""Ju, Hongrun"",""Lin, Xiaojuan"",""P.

Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of C.odorata's spatial distribution is necessary for implementing relevant mitigation and management approaches to vulnerable and invaded landscapes. Remotely sensed data offer a viable opportunity for detecting and mapping AIPs spatial extents. Hence, this study sought to compare the value of algorithms (i.e. maximum likelihood and random forest) in detecting and mapping C.odorata's spatial distribution in relation to other land use land cover classes (LULC) using the freely available Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. The findings of the study revealed that the vegetation red edge and near-infrared spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) sensor were the most important spectral variables for discriminating C.odorata from other land cover classes. The random forest algorithm yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 83\%, outperforming the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (75\%) in classifying C.odorata's spatial distribution. Overall, results demonstrate that the combination of freely available Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data and machine learning random forest algorithm produces the highest accuracies for detecting the spatial distribution of C.odorata, particularly in heterogeneous environments. These results could be beneficial to sustainable rangeland management and the adoption of sitespecific mitigation approaches in areas invaded by C.odorata.","{""Buthelezi, Siphiwokuhle"",""Mutanga, Onisimo"",""Ndlovu, Helen S."",""Odindi, John"",""Sibanda, Mbulisi""}","10.1016/j.pce.2021.103081",2024-07-17 19:21:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{calibration}","{""Alien invasive plants; Classification; C; odorata; Maximum likelihood; Random forest; Sentinel-2 MSI""}"

6863304,"Robust Particle Swarm Optimization Of Rfms For High-Resolution Satellite Images Based On K-Fold Cross-Validation","Rational function model (RFM) is one of the most popular methods of geometrically correcting high-resolution satellite images (HRSIs). This model encounters overparameterization problem due to the existence of highly correlated RFM coefficients, namely, rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). Recently, a number of methods have been proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal RPCs. Although these algorithms are useful for determining the optimal RPCs, their results are strongly influenced by changes in both initial values and ground control points (GCPs) distribution. To address this problem, this study proposes a modified version of PSO based on the k-fold cross-validation, known as PSO-KFCV, which works well even in the presence of limited GCPs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, four different HRSIs were used. Our experimental results indicate that PSO-KFCV is indeed robust against the initial values and GCPs distribution. In addition, the experiments demonstrated that the proposed method led to significant improvement with respect to state-of-the-art meta-heuristic methods. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","{""Amiri-Simkooei, A."",""Gholinejad, S."",""Naeini, A.

6863073,"Characterizing Land Disturbance In Atewa Range Forest Reserve And Buffer Zone","Changes in land cover of protected areas and their buffers have serious implications on the conservation of biodiversity within such biomes because land use has been recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change. Atewa Range Forest Reserve is one of Ghana's Upper Guinea Forests declared as a Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA). But the reserve is under threat from several human disturbances which could impact on the land cover of the reserve.This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land cover of Atewa Range Forest Reserve and it's buffer between 1986 and 2013 using remote sensing. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification and change detections were undertaken using one Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) image of 1986 and Landsat ETM+ images of 2003 and 2013.The study also investigated the driving forces of LULC and the effectiveness of the Forest and Wildlife Policy of 1994 in the management of the reserve. Results of image classification showed that much of the peripheral closed and open vegetative covers have been converted to farms and bushes with little disturbance within the interior of the reserve. The study revealed that, the conservation management policies were yielding very little results due to a number of policy deficiencies including low staff strength, lack of logistics and low remuneration. Enforcement of legal instruments against illegal logging, small scale mining and farming activities within the reserve, improvement in the staff strength and their condition of service, intensification of public education on the value of forest and the need to protect it are some of the major recommendations that could curb encroachment on the reserve.

6862915,"Geographically Weighted Machine Learning And Downscaling For High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Estimations Of Wind Speed","High-resolution spatiotemporal wind speed mapping is useful for atmospheric environmental monitoring, air quality evaluation and wind power siting. Although modern reanalysis techniques can obtain reliable interpolated surfaces of meteorology at a high temporal resolution, their spatial resolutions are coarse. Local variability of wind speed is difficult to capture due to its volatility. Here, a two-stage approach was developed for robust spatiotemporal estimations of wind speed at a high resolution. The proposed approach consists of geographically weighted ensemble machine learning (Stage 1) and downscaling based on meteorological reanalysis data (Stage 2). The geographically weighted machine learning method is based on three base learners, which are an autoencoder-based deep residual network, XGBoost and random forest, and it incorporates spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity to boost the ensemble predictions. With reanalysis data, downscaling was introduced in Stage 2 to reduce bias and spatial abrupt (non-natural) variation in the predictions inferred from Stage 1. The autoencoder-based residual network was used in Stage 2 to adjust the difference between the averages of the fine-resolution predicted values and the coarse-resolution reanalysis data to ensure consistency. Using mainland China as a case study, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) ensemble predictions were shown to perform better than individual learners' predictions (with an approximately 12-16% improvement in R2 and a decrease of 0.14-0.19 m/s in root mean square error). Downscaling further improved the predictions by reducing inconsistency and obtaining better spatial variation (smoothing). The proposed approach can also be applied for the high-resolution spatiotemporal estimation of other meteorological parameters or surface variables involving remote sensing images (i.e. reliable coarsely resolved data), ground monitoring data and other relevant factors. © 2019 by the authors.","{""Li, L.""}","10.3390/rs11111378",2024-10-03 20:56:33,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2019,"{}","{""Autoencoder-based deep residual network"",Downscaling,""Ensemble learning"",""Geographically weighted regression"",""Random forest"",""Wind speed""}"

6691613,"Remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring: a review of methods for biodiversity indicator extraction and assessment of progress towards international targets","Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.","{""Petrou, Zisis""}","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-015-0947-z",2024-04-22 02:54:13,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",""Review or opinion""}",2015,"{}","{""Biodiversity indicator|Remote sensing|Indicator estimation|Aichi Targets|CBD biodiversity indicators""}"
6862842,"Socioeconomic Factors Influencing Land Cover Changes In Rural Areas: The Case Of The Sierra De Albarracín (Spain)","Rural abandonment in mountainous regions is a habitual process that occurs in many countries and has socioeconomic and environmental implications. Land cover changes in Mediterranean mountains resulting from farming abandonment have been associated with certain processes of land degradation. This study employed Landsat satellite images for mapping the land cover changes in 1984 and 2007, south of the Iberian Range (region of Sierra de Albarracín, Teruel, Spain). A neural network classification was used to achieve sufficient land cover accuracy. The land cover change analysis revealed an expansion of forestland at the expense of pastureland and abandoned rainfed cropland. These changes were associated with demographic and economic shifts that resulted from a continuous process of rural abandonment. Population reduction has been the natural trend for a century, characterized by massive internal migrations to nearby cities. The dynamic displacement of the population centroid was used to identify the migratory processes in the last century. The primary sector and the associated secondary sector (farming and forestry) were diminished and resulted in a decrease in natural resource exploitation. Economic activity moved towards the tertiary sector, which focuses on rural tourism. The current socioeconomic scenario has unknown future implications for land cover dynamics and their associated ecosystem services values. Thus, monitoring of land cover changes and ecosystem services is required to promote sustainable development in an area that is highly dependent on the conservation of natural resources and ecological services. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","{""Gómez, I."",""Hernández, E.

6863553,"Multi-Year Simulation Of Mediterranean Forest Transpiration By The Integration Of Noaa-Avhrr And Ancillary Data","The estimation of transpiration fluxes through wide vegetated land surfaces is of great importance for the proper planning and management of environmental resources, particularly in areas where water is a main limiting factor during at least part of the growing cycle. While remotely sensed techniques cannot directly measure these fluxes, they can provide useful information on vegetation variables such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), which are functionally related to the mentioned processes. The aims of the present work were: ( a) to illustrate the use of multi-temporal LAI profiles derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data as input for a biogeochemical model (Forest-BGC) which simulates the main processes of forest vegetation ( transpiration and photosynthesis); and (b) to analyse the sensitivity of the calibrated model to its main driving variables ( meteorological data and NDVI-derived LAI profiles) in order to assess their relative importance for operational transpiration monitoring. In particular, the model was applied to two oak stands in the Tuscany Region ( central Italy), which are representative of Mediterranean forests and for which a calibration phase had already been performed. Simulations were carried out for a 15-year period ( 1986 - 2000) using as inputs daily meteorological data and NDVI-derived monthly LAI profiles. The sensitivity of the model to both input types was then assessed through other model runs with fixed values of the two variables. The results of these experiments indicated that the remotely sensed LAI estimates are the main determinant of simulated transpirations, especially during the Mediterranean arid season ( summer) when water resources are the primary limiting factor for vegetation development.","{""Bindi, M"",""Chiesi, M"",""Maselli, F""}","10.1080/01431160310001653546",2024-10-03 21:45:46,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2004,"{}",NA

Bale Mountain Eco-Region in Ethiopia is a biodiversity-rich ecosystem where such LULCC have occurred. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) determine which LULC types gained or lost most as a result of the observed LULCC; (ii) identify the major drivers of the LULCC/deforestation; and (iii) assess the approximate amount of carbon stock removed as a result of deforestation during the study period. Remote sensing and GIS were used to analyze LULCC. Landsat images acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used. Additionally, data from the Central Statistics Agency on cropland expansion, and human and livestock population growth were analyzed and correlations were made. The results showed that forest lost 123,751 ha while farmland gained 292,294 ha. Farmland and urban settlement expansion were found to be major drivers of LULCC. Aboveground carbon stock removed from forest and shrubland was more than 24 million tons. In the future, allocation of land to different uses must be based on appropriate land use policies.

6863477,"Quantifying Aboveground Biomass Dynamics From Charcoal Degradation In Mozambique Using Gedi Lidar And Landsat","Understanding changes to aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests undergoing degradation is crucial for accurately and completely quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and for environmental monitoring in the context of climate change. Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendr-stabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 ± 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 ± 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events. © 2022","{""Duncanson, L."",""Liang, M."",""Sedano, F."",""Silva, J.

Focussing on the Yesanpo Scenic Area with more than 4.5 million visitors each year and annual tourism revenue of 150 million yuan, flood risk modelling was undertaken using HEC-HMS and FlO-2D. Three flood scenarios (a real event that occurred in 2012, a hypothetical flood in 2017, and a future flood scenario) were evaluated using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. The results show that from 2012 to 2017, due to the development of tourism and changes in land-use in the area, the flash flood risk increased by 28%. During this six-year period, most of the agricultural land surrounding the Juma River has been changed to tourist use and the land value has increased by 38%. Based on an inundation depth of 0.5 m, land value losses are expected in the order of 104 yuan m−2 for business use land and 0.8 yuan m−2 for agricultural land. Relative to the baseline flood scenario, the flood risk in three studied villages is expected to increase significantly by 103% under the modelled future scenario. Even where disasters have been experienced, risks are often ignored in tourist areas because tourism in these areas can generate high revenue. Our findings provide important new information for tourism planners facing the long-term effects of flash floods.

6863405,"Spatiotemporal Variation Of Evapotranspiration On Different Land Use/Cover In The Inner Mongolia Reach Of The Yellow River Basin","The accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understanding the water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth system. This study focused on the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid region. Although there are many remote sensing ET datasets, many of the ET algorithms have not considered the impact of soil moisture, especially in water-limited areas. In this paper, the new PT-JPL model, which incorporates soil moisture into ET simulation, is used to improve the accuracy of ET simulation in water-limited areas. The simulation value is evaluated using two Hobq Desert eddy-covariance towers and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PML-V2) dataset. The new PT-JPL model shows the most significant improvements in water-limited regions; the coefficient of determination can reach 0.826, and the RMSE can reduce to 9.645 W/m(2). Soil evaporation is central to the actual ET increase in the study area. Implementing ecological restoration projects reduced the exposed area of land in the study area and reduced the rate of total ET effectively. Furthermore, the most advanced machine learning local interpretation algorithm-the TreeExplainer-based Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method-was used to identify the driving factors of ET capacity under different land use types. Temperature, NDVI, and root zone soil moisture were the main environmental factors causing ET changes in different plants. Meanwhile, temperature and root zone soil moisture had a noticeable coupling effect, except for grassland. Furthermore, a threshold effect of temperature to ET was found, and the value is 25, 30, and 30 degrees C in the forest, grassland, and cropland, respectively. This study provides an essential reference for accurately describing the ET characteristics of arid and semi-arid regions to achieve the efficient management of water resources.","{""Wang, Guoqiang"",""Wang, Libo"",""Wang, Yuntao"",""Xue, Baolin"",""Zhang, Xiaojing""}","10.3390/rs14184499",2024-09-30 16:18:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2022,"{}","{""evapotranspiration; soil moisture; TreeExplainer-based Shapley additive explanation (SHAP); threshol"",""semi-arid region""}"
6447823,"Assessing People’s Values of Nature: Where Is the Link to Sustainability Transformations?","The efforts to measure people’s current preferences and values of ecosystem services raise questions about the link to sustainability transformations. The importance of taking social and cultural values of nature into account is increasingly recognised within ecosystem services research and policy. This notion is informing the development and application of social (or socio-cultural) valuation methods that seek to assess and capture non-material social and cultural aspects of benefits of ecosystems in non-monetary terms. Here, ‘values’ refer to the products of descriptive scientific assessments of the links between human well-being and ecosystems. This precise use of the values term can be contrasted with normative modes of understanding values, as underlying beliefs and moral principles about what is good and right, which also influence science and institutions. While both perspectives on values are important for the biodiversity and ecosystem services agenda, values within this space have mainly been understood in relation to assessments and descriptive modes of values. Failing to acknowledge the distinction between descriptive and normative modes bypasses the potential mismatch between people’s current values and sustainability transformations. Refining methodologies to more accurately describe social values risks simply giving us a more detailed account of what we already know—people in general do not value nature enough. A central task for values studies is to explore why or how peoples’ mindsets might converge with sustainability goals, using methods that go beyond assessing current states to incorporate change and transformation.","{""Stålhammar, Sanna""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2021,"{}",NA

This study aims to analyze the short- and long-term shoreline changes in South Andaman, focusing on 2004-2005 (pre- and post-tsunami) and 1990-2023 (to assess periodic changes). Using remote sensing techniques and geospatial tools such as the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), shoreline change rates were calculated in four zones, revealing the extent of the tsunami's impact. During the pre- and post-tsunami periods, the maximum coastal erosion rate was -410.55 m/year, while the maximum accretion was 359.07 m/year in zone A, the island's east side. For the 1990-2023 period, the most significant coastal shoreline erosion rate was also recorded in zone A, which was recorded at -2.3 m/year. After analyzing the result, it can be seen that the tsunami severely affected the island's east side. To validate the coastal shoreline measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Landsat-7 and Google Earth was 18.53 m, enabling comparisons of the accuracy of different models on the same dataset. The results demonstrate the extensive impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on South Andaman's coastal shoreline and the value of analyzing shoreline changes to understand the short- and long-term consequences of such events on coastal ecosystems. This information can inform conservation efforts, management strategies, and disaster response plans to mitigate future damage and allocate resources more efficiently. By better understanding the impact of tsunamis on coastal shorelines, emergency responders, government agencies, and conservationists can develop more effective strategies to protect these fragile ecosystems and the communities that rely on them.","{""Kanga, Shruti"",""Kumar, Pankaj"",""Meraj, Gowhar"",""Pandey, Vikas"",""Prajapat, Deepak Kumar"",""Singh, Saurabh"",""Singh, Suraj Kumar""}","10.3390/jmse11061134",2024-07-19 23:37:01,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""coastal shorelines; ocean earthquake; coastal nearshore; coastline; DSAS""}"

6863322,"Forest Fire Susceptibility And Risk Mapping Using Remote Sensing And Geographical Information Systems (Gis)","Purpose - In a tropical country like Malaysia, forest fire is a very common natural and man-made disaster that prevails in the whole South East Asian region throughout the year. Recently, the haze problem in Malaysia has created a lot of awareness among the government and eco-tourism sectors. Therefore, detection of the hotspot is very important to delineate the forest fire susceptibility mapping. In this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to evaluate forest fire susceptibility at Sungai Karang and Raja Muda Musa Forest Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia. Frequency ratio model has been applied for the delineation of forest fire mapping for the study area. Design/methodology/approach - Forest fire locations were identified in the study area from historical hotspots data from year 2000 to 2005 using AVHRR NOAA 12 and NOAA 16 satellite images. Various other supported data such as soil map, topographic data, and agro climate were collected and created using GIS. These data were constructed into a spatial database using GIS. The factors that influence fire occurrence, such as fuel type and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), were extracted from classified Landsat-7 ETM imagery. Slope and aspect of topography were calculated from topographic database. Soil type was extracted from soil database and dry month code from agroclimate data. Forest fire susceptibility was analyzed using the forest fire occurrence factors by likelihood ratio method. Findings - A new statistical method has been applied for the forest fire susceptibility mapping. The results of the analysis were verified using forest fire location data with the help of a newly written programming code. The validation results show satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on forest fire location. The GIS was used to analyze the vast amount efficiently, and statistical programs were used to maintain the specificity and accuracy. The result can be used for early warning, fire suppression resources planning and allocation. Originality/value - All data used in this study are original.

6863214,"The Use Of Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance Systems For Evidence-Based Decision-Making: Physical Activity And Nutrition As Examples","Objective: To highlight the value of continuous risk factor surveillance systems in providing evidence of the impact of, and to inform health promotion interventions. Method: An ongoing risk factor surveillance system involving telephone interviews with approximately n = 600 randomly selected South Australians each month. Trend analysis on physical activity (PA) levels and daily consumption of fruit and vegetables was undertaken. Results: An apparent seasonal trend for fruit consumption and PA was found, with less activity and fruit consumption undertaken in winter months. Overweight/obese adults exercised less than those with normal BMI, and females less than males, although PA rates for both females and overweight/obese adults are rising. There was an increase in vegetable consumption following a major media campaign. Although reported prevalence of the consumption of five or more serves of vegetables daily and the mean number of serves consumed daily has decreased, it is still above pre-campaign rates. Conclusion: Additional information obtained from a risk factor surveillance system, when compared to an annual or point-in-time survey, provides valuable evidence for health professionals interested in measuring and assessing the effectiveness of health promotion interventions. © 2009 Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland.","{""Campostrini, S."",""Carter, P."",""Dal Grande, E."",""Gill, T.

6863537,"Wildland Fire Management And Air Quality In The Southern Sierra Nevada: Using The Lion Fire As A Case Study With A Multi-Year Perspective On Pm2.5 Impacts And Fire Policy","Management of fire is an important and controversial policy issue. Active fire suppression has led to a backlog of fuels, limited the ecological benefits of fire, and reduced short-term smoke impacts likely delaying these emissions to future generations over a larger spatial extent. Smoke impacts can be expected to increase as fire size and intensity increase and the fuel backlog is consumed; whether through reintroduction of fire under desirable conditions or through stand replacing fire. Land Management Agencies would like to increase the use of naturally ignited fires to burn during favorable conditions as a way to reduce catastrophic fires. This study provides information about the levels of air quality impacts expected from these types of fires and discusses some of the policy controversies of managed fire that propagate inconsistencies between agencies and enter the public discourse. The Lion Fire, a primarily low intensity 8,370ha fire that was extensively monitored for Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), is used to quantify impacts to air quality. PM2.5 monitoring sites are used to assess exposure, public health impacts, and subsequently quantify annual air quality during a year with a fire that is within the historic normal fire size and intensity for this area. Ground level PM2.5 impacts were found to be localized with 99% of the hourly Air Quality Index readings in the moderate or good category for the sites impacted by the fire. PM2.5 concentrations at sites nearest the fire were below annual federal air quality standards for PM2.5 with annual 98th percentile at the most impacted sites (Johnsondale, Kernville, and Camp Nelson) of 35.0, 34.0, and 28.0μgm-3 respectively. Smoke impacts to PM2.5 concentrations were not found to reach the populated Central Valley. The findings suggest that this type of fire can be implemented with minimal public health impacts thus allowing an opportunity for air and fire managers to alter policy to allow additional burning in an area with severe anthropogenic air pollution and where frequent widespread fire is both beneficial and inevitable. The more extensive air quality impacts documented with large high intensity fire may be averted by embracing the use of fire to prevent unwanted high intensity burns. A widespread increase in the use of fire for ecological benefit may provide the resiliency needed in Sierra Nevada forests as well as be the most beneficial to public health through the reduction of single dose exposure to smoke and limiting impacts spatially. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","{""Cisneros, R."",""Schweizer, D.""}","10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.06.007",2024-07-12 19:23:07,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{""Air Pollutants"",""Air quality"",California,""Conservation of Natural Resources"",Fires,Humans,""Particle Size"",""Particulate Matter"",Policy,""Public health"",""Sierra Nevada [California]"",""Smoke impacts"",""United States"",""Wildland fire"",""air monitoring"",""air pollutant"",""air pollution"",""air pollution control"",""air quality standard"",""ambient air"",analysis,article,control,""ecosystem resilience"",""environmental impact"",""environmental impact assessment"",""environmental management"",""environmental planning"",""environmental protection"",fire,""fire management"",fuel,human,""population density"",""prescribed burning"",prevention,procedures,""protocol compliance"",""satellite imagery"",smoke,wildfire,""wildland fire management""}"

This study aims to assess VCC and its impacts on rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) in a highly deforested and populated area of Ethiopia. We used (i) Landsat images to analyze VCC using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and threshold method and (ii) Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRPS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to evaluate rainfall and LST in the area using Mann-Kendall trend (MKT) test. Results show that 4.7\% (210,177 ha) and 2.6\% (116,387 ha) of the area was covered by vegetation in 1985 and in 2017 respectively, which implied that 2.1\% (93,790 ha) of vegetation cover loss over the last 32 years. Although the mean annual rainfall increased from 1981 to 2017 and mean dry season LST increased from 2000 to 2017, the MKT test shows no significant trend with p-values of 0.09 and 0.35 rainfall and LST, respectively. Mean annual rainfall decreased with declining vegetation cover and mean LST increased as vegetation cover declined in central, northern and southeastern parts of the study area.

6691735,"Information systems in support of wildland fire management decision making in Canada","This paper provides an overview of four national forest fire management information systems currently used in Canada. The Canadian forest fire danger rating system (CFFDRS) is a non-spatial system, which provides the science framework for fire danger rating in Canada. The spatial fire management system (sFMS) is a geographic information system based fire management information system that implements two core subsystems of the CFFDRS, along with other models and systems. The sFMS is the spatial engine that has been used to implement both of Canada's national forest fire management information systems, the Canadian wildland fire information system (CWFIS) and the fire monitoring, mapping and modeling system (Fire M3). The CWFIS is Canada's national fire management information system; it presents daily information on fire weather, fire behavior potential and selected upper atmospheric conditions. Fire M3 integrates the use of satellite technology for monitoring and mapping large fire occurrence in Canada. Fire M3 also incorporates information from CWFIS to model the impacts of large forest fires based on fire weather conditions and potential fire behavior.","{""Lee, B.S.""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1699(02)00120-5",2024-04-23 22:31:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2002,"{}","{""Satellite technology|Information systems|Geographic information|Wildland fire""}"
6863555,"Estimating Rangeland Forage Production Using Remote Sensing Data From A Small Unmanned Aerial System (Suas) And Planetscope Satellite","Rangelands cover ~23 million hectares and support a $3.4 billion annual cattle industry in California. Large variations in forage production from year to year and across the landscape make grazing management difficult. We here developed optimized methods to map high-resolution forage production using multispectral remote sensing imagery. We conducted monthly flights using a Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) in 2017 and 2018 over a 10-ha deferred grazing rangeland. Daily maps of NDVI at 30-cm resolution were first derived by fusing monthly 30-cm sUAS imagery and more frequent 3-m PlanetScope satellite observations. We estimated aboveground net primary production as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) derived from NDVI and light use efficiency (LUE), optimized as a function of topography and climate stressors. The estimated forage production agreed well with field measurements having a R2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 542 kg/ha. Cumulative NDVI and APAR were less correlated with measured biomass (R2 = 0.68). Daily forage production maps captured similar seasonal and spatial patterns compared to field-based biomass measurements. Our study demonstrated the utility of aerial and satellite remote sensing technology in supporting adaptive rangeland management, especially during an era of climatic extremes, by providing spatially explicit and near-real-time forage production estimates. © 2019 by the authors.","{""Covello, S."",""Dahlgren, R.

6862798,"Improvements In High-Speed Rail Network Environmental Evaluation And Planning: An Assessment Of Accessibility Gains And Landscape Connectivity Costs In Spain","High Speed Rail (HSR) in Spain began in 1992 and curently has a network of about 3400 km. In this 25-year period, accessibility has progressively increased, and its spatial distribution has changed throughout the territory. This has had important implications for territorial cohesion, which is a strategic planning objective of transport infrastructures in the European Union. However, this increase in HSR has environmental impacts; among other effects, new transport infrastructures imply a loss of landscape structural connectivity. This paper has two objectives: to study the distribution and development of the changes across the territory produced by the arrival of HSR in Spain between 1990 and 2025, by looking at changes in potential accessibility and structural habitat connectivity at the national scale; and to study – at the same scale – the relationship between both variables through the cost of accessibility improvements (socioeconomic variable) in terms of the loss of structural connectivity (environmental variable). All the analyses were done using GIS-based indicators, reported in the literature to be useful at the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) scale. The methodology is applied in different horizon years, namely 1990, 2007, 2016, and new proposed HSR lines to 2025 in Spain. The results show that throughout the whole period (1990−2025), accessibility improved by 74.7 % due to the extension of HSR. The most important period was 1990−2007, when the main socio-economic centres were connected by HSR, while connectivity, the environmental variable, declined by −3.4 %. The greatest connectivity loss was concentrated in 2007−2016, when the areas with the highest connectivity values in 1990 were the most affected. Our results show that a 1 % increase in accessibility implied a loss of connectivity of 0.03 % in the interval 1990−2007, while in the second period, the same 1 % increase entailed a 0.17 % loss; in the 2016−2025 scenario the value is intermediate (0.08). Our work contributes to adapting connectivity studies to the environmental assessment tiers in the transportation sector (i.e. plans, programmes and projects). Each stage has its limitations due to the lack of specific data or problems of spatial scale which must be publicly reported during environmental assessment processes. We also highlight the need for new research to establish a reliable spatial scale to assess the different effects of HSR corridors at the strategic level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","{""Iglesias-Merchan, C."",""Martín, B."",""Ortega, E."",""de Isidro, Á""}","10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105301",2024-07-17 17:12:56,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",2021,"{}","{Accessibility}"

6903599,"Water Body Extraction From Sentinel-2 Imagery With Deep Convolutional Networks And Pixelwise Category Transplantation","A common task in land-cover classification is water body extraction, wherein each pixel in an image is labelled as either water or background. Water body detection is integral to the field of urban hydrology, with applications ranging from early flood warning to water resource management. Although traditional index-based methods such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have been used to detect water bodies for decades, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have recently demonstrated promising results. However, training these networks requires access to large quantities of high-quality and accurately labelled data, which is often lacking in the field of remotely sensed imagery. Another challenge stems from the fact that the category of interest typically occupies only a small portion of an image and is thus grossly underrepresented in the data. We propose a novel approach to data augmentation-pixelwise category transplantation (PCT)-as a potential solution to both of these problems. Experimental results demonstrate PCT's ability to improve performance on a variety of models and datasets, achieving an average improvement of 0.749 mean intersection over union (mIoU). Moreover, PCT enables us to outperform the previous high score achieved on the same dataset without introducing a new model architecture. We also explore the suitability of several state-of-the-art segmentation models and loss functions on the task of water body extraction. Finally, we address the shortcomings of previous works by assessing each model on RGB, NIR, and multispectral features to ascertain the relative advantages of each approach. In particular, we find a significant benefit to the inclusion of multispectral bands, with such methods outperforming visible-spectrum models by an average of 4.193 mIoU.",NA,"10.3390/rs15051253",2024-10-01 18:00:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

The present study area is also highly prone to landslide which mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall and earthquake. The present study highlights the spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides based on various preparatory factors. In this study 58 rain-induced landslide locations were identified and assessed the spatial distribution. Earthquake triggered landslides were assessed based on the interpretation of pre and post satellite images on 2011 Sikkim earthquake. Therefore, the study attempts to (i) show the inventory map of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides (ii) evaluate the spatial distribution pattern of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides basis of their event controlling parameters (iii) Finally, to show the characteristics of spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides in the study area. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Ground Control Points (GCP) were used for verification of rainfall induced landslide locations and the improvement of the planimetric accuracy of the Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images from the Google Earth. For the spatial distribution analysis, all raster maps were prepared using GIS techniques. After that, location wise spatial values were extracted both rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides using multi-data extraction technique in GIS environment. From the present study, it has been observed that the co-seismic landslides initiating under dry conditions could account for steeper slope angles than the rain-induced landslides. It has been also observed that rain-induced landslides on southerly slope facing is maximum, and it decreases with the angle orientation on the northerly slope facing is relatively low. The study also reveals that rain induced and earthquake triggered landslides could be found in the sparsely vegetated areas.

In order to check the changes in the regularization process, a case study was analyzed: the one of Vila Terra Santa in Curitiba / PR. Primary and secondary data were collected in two different periods of land regularization, the first set in the period between the years of 2000-2007, before the process, and the second one in the period between the years of 2008-2013, after the process. The methodology of Urban Environmental Quality was adapted for this study and consisted of eight categories of analysis with 34 variables and 43 indicators, focused on social and environmental aspects and infrastructure. It was also developed an Urban Environmental Quality Index System - UEQI by category of analysis. For a better evaluation, the values assigned to each variable for each category and, finally, to the final UEQI, were indicated in a system of quality grades from A to E, with A being a extremely satisfactory quality level, and E a very unsatisfactory level, with other 3 classes in between. From the results we observed that there was an improvement in 6 categories of analysis after the regularization process, which were evidenced in 65\% of the 34 variables evaluated by the comparison between the two periods. The final UEQI pointed out an index of 40.15in the previous regularization period, which was framed in class D, therefore in an unsatisfactory quality level. In the second period, the rate was 72.98, classifying the environmental quality of Vila Terra Santa in F, which is very satisfactory.

6691722,"The Role of Geoscience Information in  Reducing Catastrophic Loss Using a Web-Based  Economics Experiment","What role can geoscience information play in the assessment of risk and the value of insurance, especially for natural hazard type risks? In an earlier, related paper Ganderton and others (2000) provided subjects with relatively simple geoscience information concerning natural hazard-type risks. Their research looked at how subjects purchase insurance when faced with relatively low probability but high loss risks of the kind that characterize natural hazards and now, increasingly, manmade disasters. They found evidence to support the expected utility theory (definitions of economics terms can be found in a glossary at the end of report), yet there remained the implication that subjects with excessive aversion to risk were willing to pay considerably more for insurance than the actuarially fair price plus any reasonable risk premium. Here, we report the results of additional experiments that provide further support for the basic postulates of expected utility theory. However, these new experiments add considerably to the decision environment facing subjects by offering an option to purchase geoscientific information that would assist them when calculating expected losses from hazards more accurately.\n\nUsing an Internet-based mechanism to present information and gather data in an experimental setting, this research provided subjects with considerable textual and graphical information, and time to process it. Over a period of three months, almost 400 subjects participated in on-line experiments that generated approximately 22,000 usable data points for the empirical analysis discussed in this report.\n\nIn the design of the experiment, we modeled the decisions to purchase (1) a detailed map giving subjects more information regarding the distribution of losses from a hazard and (2) insurance to indemnify them from any losses should they occur. On the basis of this design, we find strong evidence in support of the expected utility theory. Many of the findings reinforce those found in the early, similar study (Ganderton and others, 2000). However, this research also finds interactions between the decision to become better informed and the decision to insure. We chose an empirical framework that allows for both explicit and implicit (unobservable) correlations between the two decisions. The results suggest that at the end of the computer game subjects recognize the benefits of greater geoscience information. They take advantage of it, but are sensitive to its cost. When subjects use the more detailed information, they are more likely to purchase insurance when it offers a net benefit.","{""Bernkopf, Richard""}","https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1683/",2024-04-26 23:00:26,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2003,"{""experimental econ""}",NA
6863507,"Blue Carbon Ecosystem Monitoring Using Remote Sensing Reveals Wetland Restoration Pathways","In an era of climate and biodiversity crises, ecosystem rehabilitation is critical to the ongoing wellbeing of humans and the environment. Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation is particularly important, as these ecosystems sequester large quantities of carbon (known in marine ecosystems as ""blue carbon "") thereby mitigating climate change effects while also providing ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits. The recent formal accreditation of blue carbon services is producing a proliferation of rehabilitation projects, which must be monitored and quantified over time and space to assess on-ground outcomes. Consequently, remote sensing techniques such as drone surveys, and machine learning techniques such as image classification, are increasingly being employed to monitor wetlands. However, few projects, if any, have tracked blue carbon restoration across temporal and spatial scales at an accuracy that could be used to adequately map species establishment with low-cost methods. This study presents an open-source, user-friendly workflow, using object-based image classification and a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine, to accurately classify 4 years of multispectral and photogrammetrically derived digital elevation model drone data at a saltmarsh rehabilitation site on the east coast of Australia (Hunter River estuary, NSW). High classification accuracies were achieved, with > 90\% accuracy at 0.1 m resolution. At the study site, saltmarsh colonised most suitable areas, increasing by 142\% and resulting in 56 tonnes of carbon sequestered, within a 4-year period, providing insight into blue carbon regeneration trajectories. Saltmarsh growth patterns were species-specific, influenced by species' reproductive and dispersal strategies. Our findings suggested that biotic factors and interactions were important in influencing species' distributions and succession trajectories. This work can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration planning and monitoring at coastal wetlands and similar ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to apply this approach to other types of remote sensing imagery and to calculate other rehabilitation co-benefits. Importantly, the method can be used to calculate blue carbon habitat creation following tidal restoration of coastal wetlands.","{""Drummond, Christopher"",""Gaston, Troy"",""Glamore, William"",""Lanceman, Dana"",""Sadat-Noori, Mahmood""}","10.3389/fenvs.2022.924221",2024-07-19 21:09:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{potential}","{""UAV; google earth engine; environmental economic accounting; salt marsh; mangroves; rehabilitation; ""}"

6863482,"Fine Resolution Air Quality Dynamics Related To Socioeconomic And Land Use Factors In The Most Polluted Desert Metropolitan In The American Southwest","Air pollution kills approximately 4.2 million people every year. As air pollution varies significantly in different urban areas, the assessment of urban emissions is key to taking appropriate actions and formulating policies for sustainable built environments and to promote the wellbeing of people. The overarching goal of this study was to generate fine resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) using Landsat imagery and examine both the socioeconomic inequalities of air pollution exposure and the air quality variation related to different land-use categories. This study has focused on a period of unusual population growth, 2000–2010, in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. It was found that socioeconomic factors, vegetation indexes, and land use land cover types are all strong predictors of AOD, and the negative coefficients of socioeconomic values reveal insight into the social inequality of air pollution exposure. Results suggest that the government regulation on air pollution during the study period helped to improve air quality. Meanwhile, planting vegetation to mitigate air pollution should be carefully examined in order to find the right vegetation species and spatial configuration of vegetation cover in urban settings. © 2021 The Authors","{""Li, Y."",""Myint, S.

6863416,"Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of The Bare Soil Cover In The Hetian Basinal Area Of County Changting, China, During The Past 35 Years","The Hetian basinal area in County Changting of Fujian province is one of the most typical soil loss areas reddish soil regions of southern China. Local people and governments have been struggling for the control of the soil l decades. This study used remote sensing technology to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of the bare soil cover in the Hetian basinal area since 1976. The bare soil features were extracted from the Landsat images of 1976, 1988, 1999, 2004 and 2010 using two thematic indices-normalized difference soil index (NDSI) and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). After converting the original digital number values of the images to at-satellite reflectance, the soil and impervious surface features were enhanced using the two indices, respectively. The soil features were then extracted from the soil-enhanced images. However, the extracted soil information was found to have been mixed with built-up land information due to the spectral confusion between the two categories. Therefore, the NDISI was further used to filter out the unwanted built-up land information from the soil images using a logical tree algorithm, as the NDISI is the index specially designed for highlight impervious surface features represented mainly by built-up lands. Results showed that the nearly thirty-five years of fight for controlling soil loss have greatly reduced bare soil covers in the basinal area. The area of the bare soil cover has been greatly reduced from 159. 17 km2 in 1976 to 51. 98 km2 in 2010. In the three observed periods, 1976-1988, 1988-1999, and 1999-2010, the decrease in bare soil cover was in an accelerate speed, which was km2 per year, -2. 75 km2 per year, and -4. 33 km2 per year for the three periods, respectively. This corresponds major policies issued by the government for the soil loss treatment of the area. Government policies accompanied with effective actions have played a key role in the reducing of the bare soil cover in the Hetian basinal area.","{""Xu, H.""}","10.5846/stxb201204210575",2024-07-17 21:47:40,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{}","{""Bare soil index"",China,""County Changting"",Fujian,Hetian,""Impervious surface index"",Landsat,""Remote sensing"",""Soil loss"",""Universal Soil Loss Equation"",""Xinjiang Uygur"",algorithm,""bare soil"",""governance approach"",""policy approach"",""red soil"",reflectance,""satellite imagery"",""soil conservation"",""soil cover"",""spatiotemporal analysis""}"

Multi-platform observations showed that surface ozone had been increasing at rates of 0.7-1.2 ppb year(-1) over the Peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA) and 0.2-0.4 ppb year(-1) over the Maritime Continents (MC); tropospheric ozone columns had been rising throughout Southeast Asia by 0.21-0.35 DU year(-1). These observed ozone trends were better reproduced by simulations driven with satellite-constrained NOx emissions, indicating that NOx emission growths may have been underestimated for the PSEA and overestimated for the MC in the Community Emissions Data System and the Global Fire Emissions Data set. The surface ozone increases over the PSEA were driven by rapidly growing local emissions, wherein fire emission growths may still be underestimated even with satellite constraints.

6862884,"Vegetation Indices As A Tool For Mapping Sugarcane Management Zones","In precision agriculture, the adoption of management zones (MZs) is one of the most effective strategies for increasing agricultural efficiency. Currently, MZs in sugarcane production areas are classified based on conventional soil sampling, which demands a lot of time, labor and financial resources. Remote sensing (RS) combined with vegetation indices (VIs) is a promising alternative to support the traditional classification method, especially because it does not require physical access to the areas of interest, is cost-effective and less labor-intensive, and allows fast and easy coverage of large areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) to classify sugarcane MZs, compared with the conventional method, in the Brazilian Cerrado biome (savannah), where about half of Brazil ' s sugarcane production takes place. This study used historical crop production data from 5,500 production fields in three agricultural years (2015 to 2018) and NDVI and EVI2 values of 14 images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite from 2015 to 2018 in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Although improvements are still necessary and encouraged, a new methodology of classifying MZs according to VIs was proposed in this study. The NDVI was not correlated with MZs classified using the conventional method, whereas EVI2 was more sensitive to biomass variations between MZs and, therefore, could better discriminate between MZs. The EVI2 values measured in crops aged 180 to 240 days in the rainy season proved to be the best strategy for classifying MZs by RS, where MZ A, for example, had EVI2 of 0.37, compared to MZ E, which had an EVI2 of 0.32.","{""Bufon, Vinicius Bof"",""Leao, Tairone Paiva"",""de Oliveira Maia, Felipe Cardoso""}","10.1007/s11119-022-09939-7",2024-07-17 19:38:24,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{calibration}","{""Management areas; Remote sensing; Two-band enhanced vegetation index; Normalized difference vegetati""}"
6862872,"Examination Of The Relationships Between Urban Form And Urban Public Services Expenditure In China","This econometric study contributes to the ongoing debate about the costs and benefits of urban form by employing interdisciplinary means-urban planning, econometrics and public administration-to explore the relationship between urban form and urban public services expenditure. In China, particularly, rapid urbanization is accompanied by an increase of urban public services expenditure and a difference in efficiency, which undermines the promotion of urban public service development. The Chinese government has paid great attention to urban sustainable development and promoting urban public services performance; however, until recently there has been a lack of empirical studies exploring the relationship between urban public services expenditure and urban form. Thus, the present research aims to analyze this issue by using relevant indicators based on an econometric model. The results provide a promising basis for improving urban public services expenditure efficiency. Based on the urban area interpreted by remote sensing data and geographic information system, two urban form metrics, the compactness ratio and the elongation ratio, are selected and quantified to describe urban compactness and urban sprawl accurately. Panel data analyses are performed using a cross-sectional dataset of the 30 cities for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 to assess the likelihood of association between indicators of urban form and urban public services expenditure, while controlling for other determinants, such as educational level, income per capita, degree of industrialization, and unemployment rate. The results indicate that urban elongation is positively correlated to per capita urban public services expenditure and urban compactness is insignificantly correlated to it. Thus, it is recommended that policymakers consider the relationship between urban form and public services expenditure as part of urban planning and on-going strategies to promote public service efficiency.","{""Bo, Chunming"",""Liu, Yong"",""Xu, Hengzhou""}","10.3390/admsci7040039",2024-07-19 20:29:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""public services expenditure; urban compactness; urban elongation; urban planning; China""}"

Its survival and continuing vigour after 70 years is a testament to its utility, which has been achieved in spite of great changes in our understanding of the marine environment and in our concerns over how to manage it. The CPR has been superseded in several respects by other technologies, such as acoustics and remote sensing, but it continues to provide unrivalled seasonal and geographic information about a wide range of zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa. The value of this coverage increases with time and provides the basis for placing recent observations into the context of long-term, large-scale variability and thus suggesting what the causes are likely to be. Information from the CPR is used extensively in judging environmental impacts and producing quality status reports (QSR); it has shown the distributions of fish stocks, which had not previously been exploited; it has pointed to the extent of ungrazed phytoplankton production in the North Atlantic, which was a vital element in establishing the importance of carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. The CPR continues to be the principal source of large-scale, long-term information about the plankton ecosystem of the North Atlantic. It has recently provided extensive information about the biodiversity of the plankton and about the distribution of introduced species. It serves as a valuable example for the design of future monitoring of the marine environment and it has been essential to the design and implementation of most North Atlantic plankton research.

6863410,"Concepts Of Geotechnical Mapping For River Valley Projects In Western India","The paper discusses the significance of engineering geology maps, choice of mappable units and scale, and their utility in feasibility, design, construction and post-construction stages. These aspects and the scale are governed by the nature of the superstructure, geomorphological, geological, tectonic and geoseismological setting of the area. In India, it is incumbent to have a geological appraisal (preferably by the Geological Survey of India) before major Civil Engineering Projects are taken up. Engineering geology mapping is expected to suit the phases of planning, design and construction. The scale of engineering geology maps varies from 1:63,360 to 1:120. Large scale maps are prepared to project specific geological features. Base maps are primarily conventional geological maps, aerial photos and Landsat imageries. Maps for construction materials portray the utility of particular deposits and their economics. For environmental and urban geology studies, a separate method of mapping is adopted. Collection of subsurface data from underground exploration by drifts, adits etc., in the form of detailed logs and maps enable evaluation of the competence of the rock mass vis-a-vis the superincumbent structure. The existing methods present the geological, lithological and structural data with particular attention to tectonic features likely to influence Civil Engineering Works. The paper illustrates these aspects from the case studies of major projects in Western India. The utility of engineering geology maps meant for different aspects will in future also include adequate geomechanical data. An attempt at standardisation of engineering geology maps for different purposes would be necessary. © 1979 International Association of Engineering Geology.","{""Shenoi, R. S."",""Srinivasan, P.

6862766,"Assessing The Soil Erosion Control Efficiency Of Land Management Practices Implemented Through Free Community Labor Mobilization In Ethiopia","This study aimed to assess the influence of conservation practices (P) and cover management (C) on soil loss reduction by determining it at the scale of landscape units in 16 systematically selected watersheds. Focusing on major land management practices implemented through free community labor mobilization, the assessment combined remote sensing techniques, field observation, and expert as well as local knowledge. The results show an average net decrement of 39\% ( +/- 19\%) in the P factor value and 8.9\% ( +/- 21\%) in the C factor value after implementation of land management practices. P factor value reduction is linked to a high area coverage of level structures, while increases in the P factor value are associated with poor quality of structures, inappropriate practices, and wide spacing between structures on steep slopes. C factor value reduction is observed in non-arable shrub- and bushland with enriched area closure, whereas increased C factor values are associated with open access grasslands and untreated croplands. The overall change in P and C factor values resulted in a 42\% ( +/- 28\%) relative soil loss reduction. The demonstrated approach makes it possible to assess spatial and temporal dynamics in the P and C erosion factors and to estimate spatially disaggregated changes in the P and C factor values. This can help to improve parameterization of inputs for erosion modelling and to assess their relative soil loss effect. The approach provides valuable feedback on watershed planning processes and supports informed decisions regarding the appropriate selection of land management practices.

6863422,"Exploring Temperature Indices By Deriving Relationship Between Land Surface Temperature And Urban Landscape","Global warming and climate change are two indispensable phenomena that cannot be overlooked. These can be inferred to the unrelenting rise in surface temperature globally. Unplanned and speedy urbanization is one of the foremost causes of surface temperature rise as it alters the landscape. Urbanization defines the socio-economic value of city and management but if inadvertent, it can lead to serious insinuations on environmental parameters. As a result of globalization and industrialization, a sheer increase in population was observed due to migration, improved health facilities, better job opportunities and superior living standards. It is necessary to inculcate the demand of these rising urban dwellers in the form of infrastructure, energy, clean air and water. As a result of this, landscape restructuring befalls that can be understood by conversion of green or open spaces into concrete structures. This alters the surface properties causing changes in latent and sensible heat flux leading to increased surface temperature as well as ambient air temperatures. With clustered urban spaces and decrease in vegetation cover and water that acts as sinks, the temperature of urban region shoots more than nearby rural areas leading to the development of urban heat islands. These parameters are directly and indirectly related to air pollution, increased summer days, energy requirement, heat-related diseases, emission of GHGs (greenhouse gases). The communication focuses on the recent challenges and criticism faced by developing Indian cities with very minimum landscape to house burgeoning population, immediate strategies and action-plan required to tackle increasing temperatures and mitigate negative environmental impacts and effects on human beings. The study is an attempt to establish a relationship between surface temperature and land use pattern for Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Study also deals with the estimation of various temperature indices for defining and understanding the variation in surface temperature precisely. Application of these results will help in developing necessary policy measures and sustainable actions that are required to reduce anthropogenic effects on urban and natural environment.","{""Bharath, H.

Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Union’s Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public.

6863380,"Optimizing The Gabor Bandwidth Of Satellite Navigation Signals By Mcs Signal Expression","Satellite navigation is playing an important role in social life. The performances of the services a navigation system provides are the concern of the builders and users. The signal structure determines the inherent ability of a satellite navigation system to provide these services. Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to optimize the signal in the initial design. The waveforms of signals in satellite navigation chips are an important aspect of the signal's structure, which impact the characteristics of the autocorrelation function and power spectrum in the time domain and frequency domain. The range accuracy of a navigation system is usually described by its Gabor Bandwidth. The Gabor Bandwidth of the Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation in next-generation GNSS signal systems is not optimal. This paper presents a signal expression based on Multilevel Coded Symbol (MCS) signals, which can describe the fine structure of navigation signals. With this expression, we can optimize the Gabor Bandwidth of the signal, and find out the corresponding MCS vector and chip waveform, so as to get higher range accuracy. The method in this paper, in theory, is of great value in the design of next-generation navigation signals. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","{""Lu, M."",""Yao, Z."",""Zhang, X.""}","10.1007/s11433-011-4329-6",2024-07-19 21:06:05,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2011,"{navigation}","{""Gabor Bandwidth"",bound}"

The real-time remote monitoring of patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves when patients are considered ‘big data’. To our knowledge, no study has highlighted the link between ‘big data’ characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the six ‘Vs’: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability. Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and real-time remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised.

6863108,"Interannual Variation In Commercial Oyster (Crassostrea Gigas) Farming In The Sea (Florianopolis, Brazil, 27°44′ S; 48°33′ W) In Relation To Temperature, Chlorophyll A And Associated Oceanographic Conditions","Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g. temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W 30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture management and genetics were standardized significant differences verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

6862788,"Visible And Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Diurnal Variation Calibration For Corn Phenotyping Using Remote Sensing","Remote sensing coupled with hyperspectral technology has become increasingly popular to investigate plant traits, showcasing its advantages in studying plant growth, health, and productivity. The quality of the collected hyperspectral images is crucial for subsequent data analysis and plant phenotyping studies. However, diurnal variations in spectral characteristics introduce more data variance in canopy reflectance spectra, raising the cost of subsequent analyses and compromising the performance of trait estimation models. In this study, a fixed gantry platform in a cornfield was used to capture visible and near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral images of corn canopies at consecutive time intervals. By applying reference board calibration and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to minimize the effects of ambient light and daily growth, diurnal spectral changes across all involved VNIR wavelengths were investigated. Several distinct diurnal patterns were observed to have close connections with the plants’ physiological effects. Diurnal calibration models were established at every wavelength by employing the least squares polynomial algorithm, with the highest coefficient of determination reaching 0.84. Moreover, by employing diurnal calibration in canopy spectra processing, the reduction in spectral variance brought about by varying imaging time was evidently exhibited. This study not only reveals the diurnal spectral variation pattern at VNIR bands but also offers a reliable, straightforward, and low-cost approach to improve the quality of remote sensing data and reduce the inherent variance brought about via the different imaging times ensuring that comparable spectral analysis can be performed under relatively fair conditions. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Jin, J."",""Ma, D."",""Wei, X."",""Zhang, J.""}","10.3390/rs15123057",2024-07-17 21:50:22,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{calibration}","{Calibration,""Cost benefit analysis"",""Diurnal variation"",""Fixed platforms"",HyperSpectral,""Imaging time"",""Infrared devices"",Phenotyping,""Plant traits"",""Quality control"",Remote-sensing,""Spectral patterns"",""Spectrum analysis"",""diurnal spectral pattern"",""hyperspectral imaging"",""near infrared"",""noise calibration"",""remote sensing"",visible}"
6863078,"House Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Ieu-Net","House buildings, as the main place for human activities, can be rapidly and accurately extracted from high-resolution remote sensing images, which is of great significance for promoting remote sensing information in disaster prevention and mitigation and town management. On the basis of deep learning, this paper proposes a pixel-level accurate extraction method for house buildings by using high-resolution remote sensing images.First, in consideration of the lack of pixel features at the edge of a sample image, an IEU-Net model is proposed on the basis of the U-Net model. A new ignore-edges categorical cross entropy function, IELoss, is designed as a loss function. Dropout and BN layers are added to help improve the speed and robustness of model training while fitting. Second, to solve the problem of limited feature richness of the model, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) is introduced into the classification process of the model, together with the remote sensing image RGB band. Lastly, when ignoring the edge prediction method, the best building extraction results can be obtained in the model prediction that corresponds to the IEU-Net model. The remote sensing image data used in this study are 0.8 m true color and infrared band data obtained by multispectral and panchromatic fusion from the GF-2 satellite of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. A label image is obtained by visually interpreting the images by using ArcGIS software and performing a feature-to-raster transformation on the obtained vector file. Then, a ground truth image of the location of houses and buildings in the remote sensing image is recorded. The MBI and RGB bands are fused, and the corresponding label images are randomly cropped to obtain 500 pieces of 256×256 training data and 100 pieces of 256×256 verification data. Regarding the IEU-Net model r value of 0.5 and the training data as the model input and using the Adam optimization algorithm for back propagation iteration for 100 times help achieve the optimal parameter results.The Overall Accuracy (OA) is 91.86%, and the kappa value is 0.802. To verify the effectiveness of IELoss in the IEU-Net model and the ignore-edges prediction method relative to CELoss and the ordinary prediction method in solving the problem of insufficient edge pixel features, this study continues the comparison by using the values of r of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 (when r is 1.0, IELoss is equivalent to CELoss, and the ignore-edges prediction method is equivalent to the ordinary prediction method). The results show that the OA of the model using IELoss and the ignore-edges prediction method is 5.03% higher than that of the model using CELoss and the ordinary prediction method, and the kappa value is 0.165 higher. To verify the effectiveness of adding MBI to the training data of the model, a comparative experiment is performed by using RGB three-band data as the training set. The prediction result obtained using the MBI-added data set is 1.55% higher than the OA of the RGB band data set. The kappa value is increased by 0.009.The experimental results show that the IEU-Net model effectively solves the problem of insufficient edge pixel features and achieves house and building extraction accuracy with high OA and kappa values. The addition of MBI data can overcome the influence of roads and house building shadows to a certain extent and accurately extract the edge information of house buildings. Therefore, if significant vegetation exists near the houses and buildings in our area of interest, we can consider adding the normalized difference vegetation index to the training set to reduce the impact of the vegetation. © 2021, Science Press.

6903554,"Two Concepts Of Secularism","Secularism, for many of us, is not a terra incognita, and yet it is certainly an improperly defined and unexplained concept. For more than 150 years, intellectuals, politicians, and theologians have used secular and secularism in a rather ambiguous way. These terms therefore need to be clarified. The time has come to rethink our whole approach to the question of secularism. Given the inapplicability of the French model of secularism to the Muslim world, it becomes necessary to find a criterion by which state involvement, when it occurs in the domain of religion, can appear to the members of a religious group as both legitimate and fair. The Indian concept of secularism based on the toleration and equal protection of all religious communities without being supportive of any particular religion can supply this criterion. That said, to pursue a secular politics of rejecting sectarianism and demanding toleration requires that strategic priorities be rearranged without making historical shortcuts. In this case, a secular politics of toleration is a twofold struggle, a resistance to uniformization and an invitation to democratization. If such a strategy is to find any role in the regulation of the lives and activities of Islamic societies today, an alternative concept of secularism, rather than simply an alternative to it, needs to be worked out. The challenge is not to abandon secularism but to formulate it as a philosophy with spiritual values, rather than solely a policy of the state. This is the only way of rethinking our whole approach to the future in Muslim societies to the extent that the pluralist model of a ""shared home"" can be presented as ""a third way"" solution to the crisis of political societies in the Middle East and in opposition to the secular authoritarianism of the state and the rise of religious fundamentalism in civil society. © 2011 by Duke University Press.",NA,"10.1215/1089201x-2010-047",2024-09-30 01:33:45,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""terra incognita"",spurious}",NA

Method: Taking remote images of Landsat 7 ETM in 2008 and Landsat 8 OLI in 2016, national basic geographic information system and ASTER GDEM digital elevation model as data sources, the ENVI and ArcGIS software was used to interpret the remote sensing images, obtain the forest land-use data, and to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of forest land, and calculate the function value of farmland food production per unit area and coefficients per unit area of forest ecosystem service value. Then, the forest ecosystem service value and its changing characteristics were analyzed. The adjustment of coefficient of dynamic value of forest ecosystem service was constructed on the basis of payment ability, willingness to pay and land by using ENVI and ArcGIS software. Forest ecosystem equivalent coefficients were adjusted, as well as environmental capacity as main parameters in order to analyze the dynamic value characteristic and its change of forest ecosystem service. Result: Forest land is mainly distributed in southern and eastern parts of the middle-high mountains in the study area. A small amount of forest scatters in western, southwest, north and eastern foothills of the middle-high mountains. Few parts are sporadic in the valley dam area. Forest area increased by 64.24 hm2, and variation range reached 11.42% from 2008 to 2016. The area of forest land converted into non-forestland reached 90.53 km2, while the forest area converted from other land-use types was 154.77 km2. There waere 73.61 km2 of forest land converting to grassland and 123.11 km2 converted from grassland. In 2016, the static value of forest ecosystem service in the study area was ¥1.497 billion, an increase of ¥153 million over ¥1.344 billion in 2008. In 2016, the proportion of forest land in the total static value of regional ecosystem service in the study area was 56.41%, which increased by 4.68% compared with 51.73% in 2008. The dynamic value of forest ecosystem service in 2008 and 2016 were respectively ¥ 475.8 million and ¥ 902.7 million, which only accounted for 35.40% and 60.30% of static value of forest ecosystem service in the same period. Conclusion: The forest land area increased rapidly, the forest land and non-forest land converted to each other frequently, leading to an obvious net increase of forest area. The area increase of forest land resulted in static value growth of forest ecosystem service. Among individual value of forest ecosystem service, soil formation and protection, gas regulation and biodiversity conservation scored the highest, while the food production had the lowest score. Although the dynamic value of forest ecosystem service is far less than the static value, the range of dynamic value change is obviously higher than that of static value.

6863614,"Combining Optical And Acoustic Data To Enhance The Detection Of Caribbean Forereef Habitats","Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50\%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

6862801,"A Meta-Analysis Of Terrestrial Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Lidar Remote Sensing","Estimating biomass of terrestrial vegetation is not only a rapidly expanding research area, but also a subject of tremendous interest for reducing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

6862742,"Agro-Climatic Classification Systems For Estimating The Global Distribution Of Livestock Numbers And Commodities","Investment in agricultural research in developing countries is being increasingly targeted at those agro-climatic zones and issues where the economic and environmental benefits may be expected to be greatest. This first requires that the zones themselves be defined, along with information on domestic livestock numbers and commodity output within agro-climatic zones in different countries. Different methods for classifying agro-climatic zones were compared. These included methods based on estimated length of growing period (LGP) using rainfall and temperature data, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (PET), and on more detailed agronomic models, remote sensing data and land use information. Zonation based on LGP has already been linked to existing national livestock data. By defining agro-climatic zones and relating concentrations of livestock populations to those of humans, it is possible to make realistic estimates of livestock populations and the production of livestock commodities for most developing countries. Detailed agro-climatic analyses. of Mainland East Asia and Sri Lanka have recently been undertaken using the GROWEST agronomic model. Using this model as the basis of agro-climatic classification appears to be significantly superior, particularly in temperate environments, to approaches based solely on LGP. Different ways of subdividing countries and continents into agro-climatic or agro-ecological zones (AEZs) are reviewed in this paper. In addition, we show how the numbers of production and commodities from domestic livestock can be allocated to such zones. We also indicate how some of this information can be applied.

6862984,"Home Telemonitoring And Remote Feedback Between Clinic Visits For Asthma","Background: Asthma is a chronic disease that causes reversible narrowing of the airways due to bronchoconstriction, inflammation and mucus production. Asthma continues to be associated with significant avoidable morbidity and mortality. Self management facilitated by a healthcare professional is important to keep symptoms controlled and to prevent exacerbations. Telephone and Internet technologies can now be used by patients to measure lung function and asthma symptoms at home. Patients can then share this information electronically with their healthcare provider, who can provide feedback between clinic visits. Technology can be used in this manner to improve health outcomes and prevent the need for emergency treatment for people with asthma and other long-term health conditions. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of home telemonitoring with healthcare professional feedback between clinic visits, compared with usual care. Search methods: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to May 2016. We also searched www.clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information. Selection criteria: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults or children with asthma in which any form of technology was used to measure and share asthma monitoring data with a healthcare provider between clinic visits, compared with other monitoring or usual care. We excluded trials in which technologies were used for monitoring with no input from a doctor or nurse. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened the search and independently extracted risk of bias and numerical data, resolving disagreements by consensus. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) while using study participants as the unit of analysis, and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) while using random-effects models. We rated evidence for all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach. Main results: We found 18 studies including 2268 participants: 12 in adults, 5 in children and one in individuals from both age groups. Studies generally recruited people with mild to moderate persistent asthma and followed them for between three and 12 months. People in the intervention group were given one of a variety of technologies to record and share their symptoms (text messaging, Web systems or phone calls), compared with a group of people who received usual care or a control intervention. Evidence from these studies did not show clearly whether asthma telemonitoring with feedback from a healthcare professional increases or decreases the odds of exacerbations that require a course of oral steroids (OR 0.93, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.44; 466 participants; four studies), a visit to the emergency department (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.58; 1018 participants; eight studies) or a stay in hospital (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.49; 1042 participants; 10 studies) compared with usual care. Our confidence was limited by imprecision in all three primary outcomes. Evidence quality ratings ranged from moderate to very low. None of the studies recorded serious or non-serious adverse events separately from asthma exacerbations. Evidence for measures of asthma control was imprecise and inconsistent, revealing possible benefit over usual care for quality of life (MD 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; 796 participants; six studies; I2 = 54%), but the effect was small and study results varied. Telemonitoring interventions may provide additional benefit for two measures of lung function. Authors' conclusions: Current evidence does not support the widespread implementation of telemonitoring with healthcare provider feedback between asthma clinic visits. Studies have not yet proven that additional telemonitori g strategies lead to better symptom control or reduced need for oral steroids over usual asthma care, nor have they ruled out unintended harms. Investigators noted small benefits for quality of life, but these are subject to risk of bias, as the studies were unblinded. Similarly, some benefits for lung function are uncertain owing to possible attrition bias. Larger pragmatic studies in children and adults could better determine the real-world benefits of these interventions for preventing exacerbations and avoiding harms; it is difficult to generalise results from this review because benefits may be explained at least in part by the increased attention participants receive by taking part in clinical trials. Qualitative studies could inform future research by focusing on patient and provider preferences, or by identifying subgroups of patients who are more likely to attain benefit from closer monitoring, such as those who have frequent asthma attacks. © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.","{""Cates, C.

Vulnerability, which reflects the degree of the adverse impact of flooding on a city, the sensitivity of the environment, and the extent to which rescues are possible during flooding, is one of the significant factors of the disaster risk assessment. Because of this, this paper proposes an Environmental Vulnerability Analysis Model (EVAM), based on comprehensively evaluating multi-source remote sensing data. The EVAM includes a two-stage, short-term flood vulnerability assessment. In the first stage, the flood's areal extension and land-use classification are extracted, based on the U-NET++ network, using multi-source satellite remote sensing images. The results from the first stage are used in the second stage of vulnerability assessment. In the second stage, combining multi-source data with associated feature extraction results establishes the Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptive capacity framework. The short-term flood vulnerability index is leveraged through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy method is calculated for an environmental vulnerability evaluation. This novel proposed framework for short-term flood vulnerability evaluation is demonstrated for the Henan Province. The experimental results show that the proportion of vulnerable cities in the Henan Province ranging from high to low is 22.22\%, 22.22\%, 38.89\%, and 16.67\%, respectively. The relevant conclusions can provide a scientific basis for regional flood control and risk management as well as corresponding data support for post-disaster reconstruction in disaster regions.","{""Cui, Chengling"",""Meng, Jian"",""Wang, Mengyao"",""Yang, Runlu"",""Yao, Jiaqi"",""Zhu, Hong""}","10.3390/rs15061609",2024-07-15 22:50:06,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""flood; Environmental Vulnerability Analysis Model (EVAM); multi-source data; U-NET plus plus; AHP""}"
6903628,"Artificial Intelligence Framework For Modeling And Predicting Crop Yield To Enhance Food Security In Saudi Arabia","Predicting crop yields is a critical issue in agricultural production optimization and intensification research. Accurate foresights of natural circumstances a year in advance can have a considerable impact on management decisions regarding crop selection, rotational location in crop rotations, agrotechnical methods employed, and long-term land use planning. One of the most important aspects of precision farming is sustainability. The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R\%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70\% for training and 30\% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100\%) and (R-2 = 96.33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process. The temperature, insecticides, and rainfall were examined with different crop yields to confirm the effectiveness of these parameters for increasing product crop yields in Saudi Arabia; we found that these items had highest relationships. The average values are R = 98.20\%, 96.50, and 99.14\% with for the temperature, insecticides, and rainfall, respectively. Based on these findings, it appeared that each of the parameter categories that are considered (temperature, pesticides, and rainfall) had a similar contribution to the accuracy of anticipated yield projection.",NA,"10.7717/peerj-cs.1104",2024-10-01 17:26:28,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6903561,"Soil Erosion Estimates In Arid Region: A Case Study Of The Koutine Catchment, Southeastern Tunisia","Soil erosion remains one of the principal environmental problems in arid regions. This study aims to assess and quantify the variability of soil erosion in the Koutine catchment using the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model. The Koutine catchment is located in an arid area in southeastern Tunisia and is characterized by an annual mean precipitation of less than 200 mm. The model was used to examine the influence of topography, extreme rainstorm intensity and soil texture on soil loss. The data used for model validation were obtained from field measurements by monitoring deposited sediment in settlement basins of 25 cisterns (a traditional water harvesting and storage technique) over 4 years, from 2015 to 2018. Results showed that slope is the most controlling factor of soil loss. The average annual soil loss in monitoring sites varies between 0.01 and 12.5 t/ha/y. The storm events inducing the largest soil losses occurred in the upstream part of the Koutine catchment with a maximum value of 7.3 t/ha per event. Soil erosion is highly affected by initial and preceding soil conditions. The RUSLE model reasonably reproduced (R-2 = 0.81) the spatiotemporal variability of measured soil losses in the study catchment during the observation period. This study revealed the importance of using the cisterns in the data-scarce dry areas as a substitute for the classic soil erosion monitoring fields. Besides, combining modeling of outputs and field measurements could improve our physical understanding of soil erosion processes and their controlling factors in an arid catchment. The study results are beneficial for decision-makers to evaluate the existing soil conservation and water management plans, which can be further adjusted using appropriate soil erosion mitigation options based on scientific evidence.",NA,"10.3390/app11156763",2024-09-30 01:29:14,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863433,"Cost-Effectiveness Of Strategies For Preventing Paediatric Lower Respiratory Infections Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus In Eight Chinese Cities","Background: New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities. Methods: We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts. Conclusions: Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available. © 2021 The Author(s)","{""Jit, M."",""Leung, K."",""Liu, D."",""Wu, J.

6659393,"Information Technology And Public Health Management Of Disasters-A Model For South Asian Countries","This paper highlights the use of information technology (IT) in disaster management and public health management of disasters. Effective health response to disasters will depend on three important lines of action: (1) disaster preparedness; (2) emergency relief; and (3) management of disasters. This is facilitated by the presence of modern communication and space technology, especially the Internet and remote sensing satellites. This has made the use of databases, knowledge bases, geographic information systems (GIS), management information systems (MIS), information transfer, and online connectivity possible in the area of disaster management and medicine. This paper suggests a conceptual model called, ""The Model for Public Health Management of Disasters for South Asia"". This Model visualizes the use of IT in the public health management of disasters by setting up the Health and Disaster Information Network and Internet Community Centers, which will facilitate cooperation among all those in the areas of disaster management and emergency medicine. The suggested infrastructure would benefit the governments, non-government organizations, and institutions working in the areas of disaster and emergency medicine, professionals, the community, and all others associated with disaster management and emergency medicine. The creation of such an infrastructure will enable the rapid transfer of information, data, knowledge, and online connectivity from top officials to the grassroots organizations, and also among these countries regionally. This Model may be debated, modified, and tested further in the field to suit the national and local conditions. It is hoped that this exercise will result in a viable and practical model for use in public health management of disasters by South Asian countries.","{""Mathew, Dolly""}","10.1017/S1049023X00002156",2024-04-11 22:01:11,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2005,"{cco}","{""control; management information systems (MIS); model; South Asia; telemedicine"",""databases; disaster; disaster management; disaster medicine; geographic information surplus (GIS); h"",""disaster information network (HDIN); health care; India; information technology; Internet coordinati""}"
6903581,"Advancing Marine Biogeochemical And Ecosystem Reanalyses And Forecasts As Tools For Monitoring And Managing Ecosystem Health","Ocean ecosystems are subject to a multitude of stressors, including changes in ocean physics and biogeochemistry, and direct anthropogenic influences. Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools. These can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, and anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies. Analysis and prediction tools are defined here as ocean circulation models that are coupled to biogeochemical or ecological models. The range of potential applications for these systems is broad, ranging from reanalyses for the assessment of past and current states, and short-term and seasonal forecasts, to scenario simulations including climate change projections. The objectives of this article are to illustrate current capabilities with regard to the three types of applications, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities. Representative examples of global and regional systems are described with particular emphasis on those in operational or pre-operational use. With regard to the benefits and challenges, similar considerations apply to biogeochemical and ecological prediction systems as do to physical systems. However, at present there are at least two major differences: (1) biogeochemical observation streams are much sparser than physical streams presenting a significant hinderance, and (2) biogeochemical and ecological models are largely unconstrained because of insufficient observations. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems will allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, with multiple societal benefits.",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2019.00089",2024-10-03 22:26:34,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA

Spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes were quantified using the post classification change detection method. The images were classified into five land use and land cover classes: forest land, shrub land, bare land, crop/grass land and other land. Landscape metrics were calculated using Fragstats to understand the landscape patterns and structural integrity of the landscape. The results showed that political transition (before and after independence) has resulted in dramatic decreases in patch density and increases in the interspersion and juxtaposition index values. The general pattern of LULC showed that the communal area compared to protected area became structurally diverse and ecologically more fragmented from 1984 to 2010. This study provides a foundation and baseline data demonstrating LULC alteration and landscape context suitable for monitoring future changes of protected and communal areas. Our approach is a novel way to assess the drivers and patterns of LULC under different land tenure types for natural resources conservation and sustainable land management in the dry lands of Southern Africa.","{""Kamwi, J.

6863044,"Risks To Carbon Storage From Land-Use Change Revealed By Peat Thickness Maps Of Peru","Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems but land-use change has led to the loss of large peatland areas, associated with substantial greenhouse gas emissions. To design effective conservation and restoration policies, maps of the location and carbon storage of tropical peatlands are vital. This is especially so in countries such as Peru where the distribution of its large, hydrologically intact peatlands is poorly known. Here field and remote sensing data support the model development of peatland extent and thickness for lowland Peruvian Amazonia. We estimate a peatland area of 62,714 km(2) (5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles of 58,325 and 67,102 km(2), respectively) and carbon stock of 5.4 (2.6-10.6) PgC, a value approaching the entire above-ground carbon stock of Peru but contained within just 5\% of its land area. Combining the map of peatland extent with national land-cover data we reveal small but growing areas of deforestation and associated CO2 emissions from peat decomposition due to conversion to mining, urban areas and agriculture. The emissions from peatland areas classified as forest in 2000 represent 1-4\% of Peruvian CO2 forest emissions between 2000 and 2016. We suggest that bespoke monitoring, protection and sustainable management of tropical peatlands are required to avoid further degradation and CO2 emissions.","{""Akesson, Christine M."",""Baker, Timothy R."",""Cole, Lydia E.

Five different DEM-based targeting indexes were compared and contrasted for the degree to which they identify similar locations in watersheds: Flow Accumulation {[}S.K. Jenson and J.O.

Results showed that they all tend to target similar locations in both watersheds which traces to the importance of larger contributing area to the rankings by each index. Disagreement among indexes traces to other variables which enable more accurate targeting under particular hydrologic circumstances. Effective use of these indexes poses special challenges, including selecting an index that better describes the hydrologic circumstances in a watershed and is simple enough to use, ensuring the accuracy of the DEM, and determining a maximum index value for the appropriateness of vegetative buffers. When properly applied, each index can provide a standardized basis and effective spatial resolution for targeting buffer placement in watersheds.",NA,"10.1111/jawr.12083",2024-10-01 17:57:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863122,"Long-Term Change Of Total Suspended Matter In A Deep-Valley Reservoir With Hj-1a/B: Implications For Reservoir Management","The valley reservoirs service as a critical resource for society by providing drinking water, power generation, recreation, and maintaining biodiversity. Management and assessment of the water environment in valley reservoirs are urgent due to the recent eutrophication and water quality deterioration. As an essential component of the water body, total suspended matter (TSM) hinder the light availability to underwater and then affect the photosynthesis of aquatic ecosystem. We used long-term HJ-1A/B dataset to track TSM variation and elucidating the driving mechanism of valley reservoirs. Taking a typical deep-valley reservoir (Xin'anjing Reservoir) as our case study, we constructed a TSM model with satisfactory performance (R-2, NRMSE, and MRE values are 0.85, 18.57\%, and 20\%) and further derived the spatial-temporal variation from 2009 to 2017. On an intra-annual scale, the TSM concentration exhibited a significant increase from 2.13 +/- 1.10mgL(-1) in 2009 to 3.94 +/- 0.82mgL(-1) in 2017. On a seasonal scale, the TSM concentration in the entire reservoir was higher in the summer (3.36 +/- 1.54mgL(-1)) and autumn (2.74 +/- 0.82mgL(-1)) than in the spring (1.84 +/- 1.27mgL(-1)) and winter (1.44 +/- 2.12mgL(-1)). On a monthly scale, the highest and lowest mean TSM value occurred in June (4.66 +/- 0.45mgL(-1)) and January (0.67 +/- 1.50mgL(-1)), and the monthly mean TSM value increased from January to June, then dropped from June to December. Combing HJ-1A/B-derived TSM, climatological data, basin dynamic, and morphology of the reservoir, we elucidated the driving mechanism of TSM variation. The annual increase of TSM from long-term HJ-1A/B data indicated that the water quality of Xin'anjiang Reservoir was decreasing. The annual increase of phytoplankton jointed with an increase of built-up land and decrease of forest land in the basin may partially be responsible for the increasing trend in TSM. This study suggested that combining the long-term remote sensing data and in situ data could provide insight into the driving mechanism of water quality dynamic and improve current management efforts for local environmental management.","{""Moreno-Madrinan, Max J."",""Shi, Kun"",""Yao, Xiaolong"",""Zhang, Yibo"",""Zhang, Yunlin"",""Zhou, Yongqiang"",""Zhu, Guangwei""}","10.1007/s11356-018-3778-0",2024-07-18 23:27:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{maybe}","{""Suspended matter; Valley reservoirs; Dynamic; Rainfall; Land cover change""}"
6863127,"Renewable Energy: The Potential Opportunities And Obligations Of Plantation Forestry","Global demand for woody biomass in substituting fossil fuels does, and will increasingly, place significant pressure on timber plantations and question conventional management practices. Plantations are rationally laid out, located in areas of high productivity, typically have good infrastructure, and are serviced by technologically efficient harvesting systems. Thus they have an inherent capacity to contribute more to bioenergy feedstocks than other, more natural, forms of forest or forest management. Sustainability goals are defined not only in terms of their in situ effect, but also in how they conform and contribute broadly to sustainable development at the local, regional and global levels. Renewable energy is generally recognised as a positive step on the pathway to sustainable development, but biomass-based renewable energy is becoming a controversial issue. In agriculture, the lure of first-generation biofuels is already distorting world food markets, energy crops such as sugar cane and oil palm continue to encroach on natural ecosystems, while in plantation forestry, everything from stumps and roots to branches and needles has taken on a new value. Not only does this threaten the ecological viability of the site, but it poses a challenge to forest management in suggesting a future and more direct competition for raw materials and the livelihoods of other users and satellite industries. Some level of trade-off between the long-term goals of plantation forestry, ecologically sound harvesting practices, and the benefits of renewable energy need to be arrived at. The challenge lies in ensuring an equitable incurrence of liabilities and distribution of benefits for all, while guaranteeing a feasible supply to a long-term investment in an energy conversion plant. Many argue that the free market should play itself out, oblivious to the fact that renewable energy plants are often subsidised. In this paper, we provide a general overview of some of the issues facing plantation forestry and the bioenergy harvest. The paper is presented primarily to stimulate discussion around issues of relevance to the emerging bioenergy sector.","{""Ackerman, P.

6863193,"Can Suspended Sediment Concentrations Be Estimated From Multispectral Imagery Using Only Image-Derived Information?","Sampling for suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in inland waters is traditionally based on collecting samples at sparse locations and in limited intervals. A number of investigators explored the utility of earth-observing satellites and air-borne sensors for monitoring of SSC over vast areas. Two approaches are commonly deployed: (1) empirical relationships between a chosen remotely sensed quantity and the actual in-situ SSC; and (2) bio-optical models founded on radiative transfer modeling. Unfortunately, in-situ measurements are often unavailable for direct image calibration, and inherent optical properties of optically active constituents (specific scattering and absorption coefficients) are usually unknown. This paper examines the possibility to retrieve SSC from multispectral satellite imagery without any in-situ data, i.e. using only image-derived information. The fundamental principle of image selfcalibration relies on the fact that in the visual domain of wavelengths (~400-700 nm) the at-sensor reflectance becomes ""saturated"" at high SSC, whereas the near-infrared domain (~700-900 nm) remains almost perfectly linearly related to sediment concentrations. The core idea of the self-calibrating procedure is rather simple and is based on fitting an exponential function between reflectance and SSC, with SSC replaced by a linear relationship between SSC and reflectance in the near-infrared domain. As a first approximation of the non-linearity between reflectance and SSC levels in the 400-700 nm range, we used the equation proposed by Schiebe et al. (1992), although other equations, especially those arising from optical theory could be used as well. The technique is illustrated on a moderately sediment-laden reservoir and two scenes acquired from Landsat ETM+. The standard error of the estimated SSC was below 15 mg/L (i.e.~25 % relative error for the observed range of SSC). Although the proposed algorithm does not yield better results than other models mentioned in the literature, the primary advantage of the outlined methodology is that no in-situ measurements (water sampling nor spectral profiling) are needed - i.e. only image-derived information is used. © 2010 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","{""Onderka, M."",""Rodný, M.""}","10.1007/s12524-010-0014-x",2024-07-18 23:29:03,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2010,"{calibration,algorithm}","{Landsat,""Landsat thematic mapper"",""Model transferability"",Optimization,Saturation,Self-calibration,""Suspended sediments"",""airborne sensing"",algorithm,calibration,""concentration (composition)"",""data acquisition"",""empirical analysis"",""environmental monitoring"",""error analysis"",""estimation method"",""in situ measurement"",""inland sea"",linearity,""multispectral image"",nonlinearity,""numerical model"",""optical property"",""optical theory"",""radiative transfer"",reflectance,""satellite imagery"",""suspended sediment"",wavelength}"
6862940,"Developing And Implementing Major League Baseball's Health And Injury Tracking System","In 2010, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement regarding the development and implementation of an electronic medical record system and a new league-wide injury surveillance system. The systems were developed to create a more efficient method to track medical histories of players longitudinally as they move across Major and Minor league affiliates, as well as to identify and monitor injury trends in the sport, identify areas of specific concern, and conduct epidemiologic research to better optimize player health and safety. The resulting injury surveillance system, the Health and Injury Tracking System (HITS), is a robust system that includes all players from the both the Major and Minor Leagues. HITS also allows for data linkage with other player- and game-level data to inform the development of injury prevention policies and programs. In the present article, we document the development and implementation of HITS; describe its utility for epidemiologic research; illustrate the potential analytic strength of the surveillance system and its ability to inform policy change; and note the potential for this new surveillance system to advance the field of sports injury epidemiology. © The Author 2016.

6863178,"Sustainable Urbanization In The China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor","Countries in the China-Indochinese Peninsula are home to rich human and natural resource endowments and have the potential to be one of the world's fastest growing areas. Sustainable urbanization in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor is important for the regional economic development and prosperity. Taking the advantages of the remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, this chapter is first presents a general overview of urbanization procession in this region and monitors the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban environment; the second objective is to present the multiple driving force factor analysis for urban development in countries of the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor using statistical models. The results indicated that the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor has experienced a rapid urbanization process during the past 15 years both in terms of urban areas and urban population (UP). In addition to socioeconomic factors, there is also a noticeable correlation between foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade and urban development in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor. Active participation in international trade and attracting foreign investment are helpful for the regional urbanization. As a neighboring country, China's economic and trade activity also has a significant impact on the urbanization in countries of the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor. Furthermore, as the launch of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor will witness a more rapid urbanization progress in the next decade. This study has its characteristics in focusing on the region of the Indochinese Peninsula in which the most rapid urbanization is occurring, presenting the state-of-the-art techniques for monitoring urban expansion and probing into the driving factors of the urban expansion in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor by multiple principles and multiple-level data. It is expected to benefit policymakers in urban development and also provide a basis for further studies of sustainable urbanization in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor.","{""Fu, Jingying"",""Jiang, Dong"",""Lin, Gang""}","10.5772/62554",2024-07-19 20:37:22,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2016,"{}","{""sustainable urbanization; China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor; remote sensing; GIS; drivin""}"
6862985,"Overview Of Knowledge Management In Eurad","Knowledge management is a core activity for the European Member States (MSs) implementing the Council Directive EC 2011/70/EURATOM. Twenty-one MSs and two associated countries have mandated their respective radioactive waste management, safety and research organisations to contribute to the European Joint Programme on Radioactive Waste Management (EURAD). EURAD has established a Knowledge Management and Networking Programme which supports the capturing of knowledge and its transfer among organisations, Member States and generations. EURAD as a Joint Programming has an utmost advantage, compared to individual projects, as it provides: processes for knowledge sharing, for example interaction between the different radioactive waste management (RWM) actors to find out what is already known and what is most useful to investigate further. Resources and people to develop new knowledge and/or to support preservation of existing knowledge at risk, for example access to experts, networks and communities of practice. Tools and technology capable of handling different forms of knowledge, with a focus on socialising, signposting and aggregating existing knowledge sources. This paper intends to describe the role of knowledge management and networking in EURAD, how knowledge generated by EURAD Workpackages and RWM organisations is captured and how we provide added value to MSs. Furthermore, it explains how we cooperate and work together towards common knowledge preservation goals with the EC PREDIS project, IAEA and OECD/NEA, to avoid duplication of work and maximise impact. © 2022 T.

6862797,"Integrating The Jrc Monthly Water History Dataset And Geostatistical Analysis Approach To Quantify Surface Hydrological Connectivity Dynamics In An Ungauged Multi-Lake System","Determining the dynamics of surface hydrological connectivity in a landscape of multiple lakes with different sizes and depths is challenging. This is especially the case for ungagged, large areas of multi-lake systems. Integrated use of remote sensing and geostatistical analysis can be a useful approach for developing metrics that can be used to identify the hydrological connectivity and their changes. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis of 18 wet and dry binary state rasters derived from Landsat images over a large ungauged multi-lake system, the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Northeast China. Our goal was to investigate applicability and dynamics of three surface hydrological connectivity metrics, namely, geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), and surface water extent (SWE) of the top 10 largest connectomes (i.e., seasonally connected water bodies). We found that, during a dry year, the reduction rate of the GCF curve was slower along the west-east (W-E) direction than along the north-south (N-S) direction, which was contrary to the patterns exhibited in a normal or wet year. The minimum values of the MDC in W-E and N-S directions in the dry year were 22.4 km and 6.3 km, respectively, while the maximum values of the MDC along the above two directions in the wet year were 50.7 km and 65.1 km, respectively. The components and spatial distribution of the top 10 largest connectomes changed dramatically in different months of each hydrological year, resulting in a huge change in the monthly SWE of the top 10 largest connectomes. Overall, this study validated the usefulness of combining remote sensing image analysis with geostatistical methods to quantify the surface hydrological connectivity from different perspectives in an ungauged area. The approach may be applicable to studies in other geographical regions, to guide water resources and wetland management practices.","{""Chen, Yueqing"",""Tan, Zhiqiang"",""Wu, Lili"",""Xu, Y.

6863327,"Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration At Landsat Spatial Scales During The Bearex'08 Field Campaign","Robust spatial information about environmental water use at field scales and daily to seasonal timesteps will benefit many applications in agriculture and water resource management. This information is particularly critical in arid climates where freshwater resources are limited or expensive, and groundwater supplies are being depleted at unsustainable rates to support irrigated agriculture as well as municipal and industrial uses. Gridded evapotranspiration (ET) information at field scales can be obtained periodically using land-surface temperature-based surface energy balance algorithms applied to moderate resolution satellite data from systems like Landsat, which collects thermal-band imagery every 16 days at a resolution of approximately 100 m. The challenge is in finding methods for interpolating between ET snapshots developed at the time of a clear-sky Landsat overpass to provide complete daily time-series over a growing season. This study examines the efficacy of a simple gap-filling algorithm designed for applications in data-sparse regions, which does not require local ground measurements of weather or rainfall, or estimates of soil texture. The algorithm relies on general conservation of the ratio between actual ET and a reference ET, generated from satellite insolation data and standard meteorological fields from a mesoscale model. The algorithm was tested with ET retrievals from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model and associated DisALEXI flux disaggregation technique, which uses Landsat-scale thermal imagery to reduce regional ALEXI maps to a finer spatial resolution. Daily ET at the Landsat scale was compared with lysimeter and eddy covariance flux measurements collected during the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote sensing EXperiment of 2008 (BEAREX08), conducted in an irrigated agricultural area in the Texas Panhandle under highly advective conditions. The simple gap-filling algorithm performed reasonably at most sites, reproducing observed cumulative ET to within 5-10\% over the growing period from emergence to peak biomass in both rainfed and irrigated fields.

Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the TRMM satellite precipitation estimates in relation to the gauge-recorded precipitation. For this, the rainfall data from the weather station located in the municipality of Santo Antônio de Goiás-GO were used, being compared to the TRMM satellite datasets, especially, the algorithms 3B42 Version 7 (V7) and Real Time (RT), during the period from January 1998 to October 2015. The comparison of the TRMM satellite data showed that the ten-day and monthly precipitation records of the 3B42 V7 algorithm showed correlation values of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively, during the rainy season; in the dry season, the correlations were of 0.80 and 0.73. The ten-day concordance index ranged from 0.68 to 0.98 and the monthly concordance index ranged from 0.83 to 0.99. The algorithm 3B42 RT presented lower statistical results when compared to the 3B42 V7. The satellite precipitation estimates showed both trends of over estimation and underestimation; however, the satellite data can help research in the absence of information on the rainfall in the region. © 2017, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Using the case of Hangzhou, China, we analyze the ecological and environmental effects of land use changes, including ecosystem services value (ESV) and carbon emissions, based on Landsat TM images from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014. We found significant ecological and environmental effects of land use changes under rapid urbanization. The value of ecosystem services in Hangzhou decreased from 546.7 million USD in 1995 to 448.97 million USD in 2014, and the ratio of ESV to GDP decreased from 5.8% to 0.6%. The net carbon emissions associated with land use changes increased from 4.26 million tons in 1995 to 15.10 million tons in 2014, mainly due to the increase of built-up land carbon emissions and the decrease of forest land carbon sink. The ESV is unevenly distributed spatially and low ESV spread from the central to the peripheral area.

6863379,"Estimation And Assessment Of The Root Zone Soil Moisture From Near-Surface Measurements Over Huai River Basin","Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is a vital variable for agricultural production, water resource management and runoff prediction. Satellites provide large-scale and long-term near-surface soil moisture retrievals, which can be used to estimate RZSM through various methods. In this study, we tested the utility of an exponential filter (ExpF) using in situ soil moisture by optimizing the optimal characteristic time length T_opt for different soil depths. Furthermore, the parameter analysis showed that T_opt correlated negatively with precipitation and had no significant correlation with selected soil properties. Two approaches were taken to obtain T_opt: (1) optimization of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE); (2) calculation based on annual average precipitation. The precipitation-based T_pre outperformed the station-specific T_opt and stations-averaged T_opt. To apply the ExpF on grid scale, the precipitation-based T_pre considering spatial variability was adopted in the ExpF to obtain RZSM from a new soil moisture dataset RF_SMAP_L3_P (Random Forest Soil Moisture Active Passive_L3_Passive) continuous in time and space over Huai River Basin. Finally, the performance of RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM (0–100 cm) was evaluated using in situ measurements and compared with mainstream products, for instance, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Level 4 (SMOS L4) RZSM. The results indicated that RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM could captured the temporal variation of measured RZSM best with R value of 0.586, followed by SMAP L4, which had the lowest bias value of 0.03, and SMOS L4 significantly underestimated the measured RZSM with bias value of −0.048 in the basin. Higher accuracy of RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM was found in the flood period compared with the non-flood period, which indicates a better application for ExpF in wetter weather conditions. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Ding, Z."",""Gou, Q."",""Horton, R."",""Liu, E."",""Lü, H."",""Pan, Y."",""Wang, X."",""Xu, H."",""Zhu, Y.""}","10.3390/atmos14010124",2024-09-30 00:40:13,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2023,"{}","{Active/passive,China,""Exponential filters"",Floods,Forestry,""Huai Basin"",""Huai rivers"",""Level 4"",""Ocean salinity"",""River basins"",""Root zone soil moistures"",""Salinity levels"",""Soil surveys"",""Surface measurement"",""Water management"",Watersheds,""exponential filter"",flood,""precipitation (climatology)"",rhizosphere,""root zone soil moisture"",salinity,""soil moisture retrievals"",""soil water balance model""}"

In Pohnpei, Micronesia, the sustainability of a coral reef finfishery was assessed by comparing coral reef fish demand to coral reef biocapacity using a marine ecological footprint (MEF) analysis. Based on geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery, Pohnpei and surrounding atolls have 184.2 km2 of coral reef habitat with a sustainable finfish yield of 573-1118 t yr-1, however total harvest was estimated at 4068 t yr-1, exceeding biocapacity by 360-710%. The MEF was supported by observed impacts to coral reef resources, including (1) long-term declines in fish spawning aggregation density, (2) reductions in mean size, age and fecundity of key commercial species, (3) reliance on undersized fish, and (4) decadal declines in mean size and abundance of fishes of iconic value and critical to ecosystem maintenance. The commercial fishery was responsible for 68% of finfish catch volume, while reef fish consumption, at 93 kg person-1 yr-1, was among the highest in the region. To sustainably meet current demand, up to 833 km2 of additional reef area would be required.

6863644,"Large-Scale Digital Mapping Of Topsoil Total Nitrogen Using Machine Learning Models And Associated Uncertainty Map","Understanding the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and factors affecting their concentration and availability is crucial for soil fertility management and sustainable land utilization while quantifying factors affecting soil nitrogen distribution in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain is mostly lacking. This study, thus, aimed at digital modeling and mapping the spatial distribution of topsoil total nitrogen (TN) in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain with an area of 150,000 ha using random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and cubist (CB) algorithms. A total of 130 observation points were collected from a depth of 0 to 30 cm from topsoil surfaces based on a random sampling pattern. Then, soil physicochemical properties, calcium carbonate equivalent, organic carbon, and topsoil total nitrogen were measured. A number of 51 environmental variables including 31 geomorphometric attributes derived from a digital elevation model with 12.5-m spatial resolution, 13 spectral indices and reflectance from SENTINEL-2 satellite (MSIsensor), and five soil properties and two spatial variables of latitude and longitude were used as covariates for digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen. The most appropriate covariates were then selected by the Boruta algorithm in the R software environment. A standard deviation map was produced to show model uncertainty. The covariate selection resulted in the separation of 14 effective covariates in the spatial prediction of topsoil total nitrogen by using the data mining algorithms. The validation of digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen by RF, DT, and CB models using 20% of independent data showed root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032, 0.035, and 0.043%; mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0008, 0.001, and 0.002%; and based on the coefficients of determination of 0.42, 0.38, 0.35, respectively. Relative importance (RI) of environmental covariates using the %IncMSE index indicated the importance of two geomorphometric variables of midslope position and normalized height along with SAVI and NDVI remote sensing variables in the spatial modeling and distribution of total nitrogen in the studied lands.

6691520,"Inclusive Design of Earth Observation Decision Support Systems for Environmental Governance: A Case Study of Lake Nokoué","Earth Observation (EO) data can enhance understanding of human-environmental systems for the creation of climate data services, or Decision Support Systems (DSS), to improve monitoring, prediction and mitigation of climate harm. However, EO data is not always incorporated into the workflow for decision-makers for a multitude of reasons including awareness, accessibility and collaboration models. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a collaborative model that addresses historical power imbalances between communities. This paper highlights a case study of a climate harm mitigation DSS collaboration between the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab and Green Keeper Africa (GKA), an enterprise located in Benin. GKA addresses the management of an invasive plant species that threatens ecosystem health and economic activities on Lake Nokoué. They do this through a social entrepreneurship business model that aims to advance both economic empowerment and environmental health. In demonstrating a Space Enabled-GKA collaboration model that advances GKA’s business aims, this study first considers several popular service and technology design methods and offer critiques of each method in terms of their ability to address inclusivity in complex systems. These critiques lead to the selection of the Systems Architecture Framework (SAF) as the technology design method for the case study. In the remainder of the paper, the SAF is applied to the case study to demonstrate how the framework coproduces knowledge that would information DSS with Earth Observation data. The paper offers several practical considerations and values related to epistemology, data collection, prioritization and methodology for performing inclusive design of climate data services.","{""Ovienmhada, Ufuoma""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.717418",2024-04-22 02:51:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""earth observation|water hyacinth|climate data services|decision support systems|design""}"

6691645,"Forest Service spending on large wildfires in the West","Since the 1970s, federal spending on wildfire suppression in the United States has grown, reaching $1 billion annually over the past decade. The USDA Forest Service has also increasingly used private contractors to conduct fire suppression. As with all activities that the Forest Service performs, the agency can employ staff directly, contract with outside businesses, or enter into agreements with nonprofit and other government entities to perform fire suppression. Historically, the Forest Service primarily used agency personnel for much of its suppression activities. However, with the decline of Forest Service personnel in the 1990s, the agency turned to contractors more frequently. Despite these growing costs and the larger role of private businesses in fire suppression, relatively little is known outside the land management agencies about what these funds are spent on, how they are spent, which activities are contracted out, and where this spending occurs. Yet, the choices that the Forest Service makes in wildfire suppression spending affect communities and economies near wildfires. In particular, local and regional capture of suppression contracts and local employment of agency staff can help mediate the negative economic impacts of a wildfire.","{""Ellison, Autumn""}","http://hdl.handle.net/1794/19041",2024-04-26 23:02:07,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Value is not measured""}",2012,"{}",NA
6862719,"Mapping The Total Phosphorus Concentration Of Biosolid Amended Surface Soils Using Landsat Tm Data","Conventional methods for soil sampling and analysis for soil variability in chemical characteristics are too time-consuming and expensive for multi-seasonal monitoring over large-scale areas. Hence, the objectives of this study are: 1) to determine changes in chemical concentrations of soils that are amended with treated sewage sludge; and 2) to determine if LANDSAT TM data can be used to map surface chemical characteristics of such amended soils. For this study, we selected two fields in NW Ohio, designated as F34 and F11, that had been applied with 34 and 11 ton acre- 1 of biosolids, respectively. Soil samples from a total of 70 sampling locations across the two fields were collected one day prior to LANDSAT 5 overpass and were analyzed for several elemental concentrations. The accumulation of Ba, Cd, Cu, S and P were found to be significantly higher in the surface soils of field F34, compared to field F11. Regression equations were established to search for algorithms that could map these five elemental concentrations in the surface soils using six, dark-object-subtracted (DOS) LANDSAT TM bands and the 15 non-reciprocal spectral ratios derived from these six bands for the May 20, 2005, LANDSAT 5 TM image. Phosphorus (P) had the highest R2 adjusted value (67.9%) among all five elements considered, and the resulting algorithm employed only spectral ratios. This model was successfully tested for robustness by applying it to another LANDSAT TM image obtained on June 5, 2005. Our results enabled us to conclude that LANDSAT TM imagery of bare-soil fields can be used to quantify and map the spatial variation of total phosphorous concentration in surface soils. This research has significant implications for identification and mapping of areas with high P, which is important for implementing and monitoring the best phosphorous management practices across the region. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

6863546,"How The Air Clean Plan And Carbon Mitigation Measures Co-Benefited China In Pm2.5 Reduction And Health From 2014 To 2020","China implemented a stringent Air Clean Plan (ACP) since 2013 to address environmental and health risks caused by ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the policy effectiveness of ACP and co-benefits of carbon mitigation measures to environment and health are still largely unknown. Using satellite-based PM2.5 products produced in our previous study, concentration-response functions, and the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of premature deaths attributable to PM(2.5 )exposure, and quantitatively estimated the policy benefits of ACP and carbon mitigation measures. We found the annual PM2.5 concentrations in China decreased by 33.65 \% (13.41 lig m(-3)) from 2014 to 2020, accompanied by a decrease in PM2.5-attributable premature deaths of 0.23 million (95 \% confidence interval (CI): 0.22-0.27), indicating the huge benefits of China ACP for human health and environment. However, there were still 1.12 million (95 \% CI: 0.79-1.56) premature deaths caused by the exposure of PM2.5 in mainland China in 2020. Among all ACP measures, clean production (contributed 55.98 \% and 51.14 \% to decrease in PM(2.5 )and pre-mature deaths attributable to PM2.5) and energy consumption control (contributed 32.58 \% and 29.54 \% to decrease in PM2.5 and premature deaths attributable to PM2.5) made the largest contribution during the past seven years. Nevertheless, the environmental and health benefits of ACP are not fully synergistic in different regions, and the effectiveness of ACP measures reduced from 2018 to 2020. The co-effects of CO2 and PM2.5 has become one of the major drivers for PM(2.5 )and premature deaths reduction since 2018, confirming the clear environment and health co-benefits of carbon mitigation measures. Our study suggests, with the saturation of clean production and source control, more targeted region-specific strategies and synergistic air pollution-carbon mitigation measures are critical to achieving the WHO's Air Quality Guideline target and the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target in China.","{""Atkinson, Peter M."",""Chang, Jinfeng"",""Fang, Xuekun"",""Hu, Bifeng"",""Jiang, Yefeng"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wang, Zhige"",""Wang, Zifa"",""Xu, Kang"",""Zhang, Ce""}","10.1016/j.envint.2022.107510",2024-07-16 23:09:38,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Air pollution; Health impact; Carbon mitigation; China Air Clean Plan""}"
6863624,"Spatial Grain Effects Of Urban Green Space Cover Maps On Assessing Habitat Fragmentation And Connectivity","The scientific evaluation of landscape fragmentation and connectivity is important for habitat conservation. It is strongly influenced by the spatial resolution of source maps, particularly in urban environments. However, there is limited comprehensive investigation of the spatial grain effect on urban habitat and few in-depth analysis across different urban gradients. In this paper, we scrutinize the spatial grain effects of urban green space (UGS) cover maps (derived from remote sensing imagery and survey data) with respect to evaluating habitat fragmentation and connectivity, comparing among different urban gradient scenarios (downtown, urban periphery, and suburban area) in Hangzhou, a megacity in China. The fragmentation was detected from three indices, including Entropy, Contagion, and Hypsometry. Then morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was applied for the landscape element identification. The possibility of connectivity (PC) and patch importance (dPC) were proposed for measuring the landscape connectivity based on Cores and Bridges from MSPA results. The results indicate that the farther the location is from downtown, the less sensitive the landscape element proportion to the spatial resolution. Among the three fragmentation indices, the overall hypsometry index has the lowest sensitivity to the spatial resolution, which implies this index's broader application value. Considering connectivity, high spatial resolution maps are appropriate for analyzing highly heterogeneous urban areas, while medium spatial resolution maps are more applicable to urban periphery and suburban area with larger UGS patches and less fragmentation. This study suggests that the spatial resolution of UGS maps substantially influence habitat fragmentation and connectivity, which is critical for decision making in urban planning and management.","{""An, Wenzhan"",""Gan, Muye"",""Huang, Lingyan"",""Huang, Lu"",""Lin, Yue"",""Shahtahmassebi, AmirReza"",""Wang, Ke"",""Ye, Ziran"",""Zhang, Jing"",""Zhu, Congmou""}","10.3390/land10101065",2024-07-18 23:47:54,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""fragmentation; connectivity; habitat conservation; spatial grain effect; urban green space; morpholo""}"
6903530,"Geoinformation Support For Safe Operation Of Pipeline Transport","The relevance of the research is determined by the need to minimize the losses at all stages of the cycle of processing and transportation of hydrocarbon raw materials and reduce environmental pollution from leaks in pipelines. Ensuring the safety of the functioning of pipeline systems requires performing operational assessments of situations at any of natural and economic objects within pipeline segment. The most advanced tools for solving analytical problems are technologies of geoinformation mapping. The general purpose of the created cartographic images is to help in organizing the safe placement of industrial facilities during construction and performing environmentalgeodynamic monitoring during pipeline operation. The main aim was to analyze the possibilities of using various geospatial information that contributes to the safe operation of pipeline systems, processed through geoinformation technologies. To achieve this goal, the work examines the domestic and international experience in preventing and eliminating oil spills, and develops requirements for GIS technology that accumulates information about natural and man-made processes. Objects. Composition of information and modules for simulation environment composed of GIS must contain the software for analysis of condition of the components of pipeline infrastructure: primary and backup threads, loopings, branches, bends, site and on-site facilities, industrial buildings, tanks, process piping, etc., and preparation of cartographic materials to ensure prevention and organization of emergency. Methods: decoding of aerospace images of pipeline systems, analysis of space survey materials, data from unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, studying the possibilities of technologies of geoinformation mapping, computer modeling of the state of natural-anthropogenic complexes. Results. The authors have analyzed the regulatory documents that determine the composition of the information necessary for formation of GIS thematic layers on the state of environmental components and the dynamics of natural processes along the routes of pipeline systems. The modules of the information system concentrate data on the disturbance and pollution of the environment, allowing you to create maps of man-made impact scenarios and formulate recommendations for assessing the state and reducing negative consequences. The work shown that the data of remote sensing of the Earth with different spatial resolutions, unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, accurate geodetic reference make it possible to form arrays of geospatial data required for modeling. The environmental safety of hydrocarbon transport is ensured by modeling the development of natural processes that have negative impact on the objects of the pipeline system. For example, when pipeline sections are flooded during floods, as well as when oil and petroleum products enter watercourses, it is necessary to use high-precision digital terrain models. It is proposed to include modules in system that support the analysis of observational data and facilitate decision-making depending on the scenarios of process dynamics, including in the case of emergency oil spills. Conclusions. The significance of the work performed is to develop a methodology for solving a number of issues that contribute to decision-making to minimize the risk of possible accidents during the operation of pipeline systems. The practical value of the proposed technology for collecting and processing primary information for filling databases of geoinformation systems is that it allows you to obtain information sufficient for decision-making in preparation of plans for preventive measures and the elimination of emergency oil spills and the organization of emergency recovery operations. © 2021 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

6863034,"Climate Change Patterns Of Wild Blueberry Fields In Downeast, Maine Over The Past 40 Years","Maine, USA is the largest producer of wild blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), an important native North American fruit crop. Blueberry fields are mainly distributed in coastal glacial outwash plains which might not experience the same climate change patterns as the whole region. It is important to analyze the climate change patterns of wild blueberry fields and determine how they affect crop health so fields can be managed more efficiently under climate change. Trends in the maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min) and average (T-avg) temperatures, total precipitation (P-total), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were evaluated for 26 wild blueberry fields in Downeast Maine during the growing season (May-September) over the past 40 years. The effects of these climate variables on the Maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVImax) were evaluated using Remote Sensing products and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. We found differences in the increase in growing season T-max, T-min, T-avg, and P-total between those fields and the overall spatial average for the region (state of Maine), as well as among the blueberry fields. The maximum, minimum, and average temperatures of the studied 26 wild blueberry fields in Downeast, Maine showed higher rates of increase than those of the entire region during the last 40 years. Fields closer to the coast showed higher rates of warming compared with the fields more distant from the coast. Consequently, PET has been also increasing in wild blueberry fields, with those at higher elevations showing lower increasing rates. Optimum climatic conditions (threshold values) during the growing season were explored based on observed significant quadratic relationships between the climate variables (T-max and P-total), PET, and EVImax for those fields. An optimum T-max and PET for EVImax at 22.4 degrees C and 145 mm/month suggest potential negative effects of further warming and increasing PET on crop health and productivity. These climate change patterns and associated physiological relationships, as well as threshold values, could provide important information for the planning and development of optimal management techniques for wild blueberry fields experiencing climate change.","{""Drummond, Francis"",""Tasnim, Rafa"",""Zhang, Yong-Jiang""}","10.3390/w13050594",2024-09-30 21:36:44,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""fruit crop; Vaccinium angustifolium; temperature; precipitation; rainfall anomaly; potential evapotr""}"
6862726,"Spatial Overlap Of Black-Browed Albatrosses With Longline And Trawl Fisheries In The Patagonian Shelf During The Non-Breeding Season","Incidental mortality in fisheries is the main at-sea threat albatrosses are facing nowadays. In this study we used remote sensing techniques to model the degree of spatial overlapping between the Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and Argentine fisheries, assuming this as a proxy of risk for albatrosses. Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal long-line fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincon estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1 degrees by 1 degrees grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38 degrees S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47 degrees s in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure. Although there were possible biases due to the limited number of tracked birds and the locations where albatrosses were captured and instrumented, the information presented in this study provides a comprehensive picture of important areas of overlapping during winter that could be used by the fishery administration to prioritize conservation actions under limited resource scenarios.

6903466,"Stand Delineation And Composition Estimation Using Semi-Automated Individual Tree Crown Analysis","Stand delineation and species composition estimation are cornerstones of forest inventory mapping and key elements to forest management decision making. Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions. High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25%. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20%, but a few were up to 30%. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

6863208,"Waterbody Extraction From Sar Imagery Based On Improved Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion And Maximum Between-Cluster Variance","The use of remote sensing technology to obtain surface waterbody information is of great significance for water resource investigation, natural disaster assessment, watershed planning, and ecological environment monitoring. As a reliable data source for large- scale ground monitoring, SAR imaging has unique advantages that optical remote sensing systems of all- weather, all- weather, and wide coverage do not have, and has been widely used in waterbody mapping. However, due to the influence of speckle noise of SAR imagery, existing methods for waterbody mapping are difficult to extract the complex and fine natural water structures from SAR imagery quickly and accurately. In this paper, a new waterbody extraction method for SAR imagery based on improved speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion and maximum between-cluster variance was proposed. First, the SAR imagery were filtered by improved speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion. The iterative process was adaptively controlled by calculating the average structural similarity between imagery in the iterative filtering process, so that the fine edges and texture structure could be preserved simultaneously. Then, based on the criterion of maximum variance between classes, the threshold value was determined adaptively, and the binary segmentation of the filtered image was conducted. In the binarized segmentation result, connected foreground regions composed of the pixel points that have same intensity values and adjoin to each other spatially, are searched. In so doing, each connected region formed an identified block. By obtaining geometric parameters of these blocks, the false segmentation of the imagery was eliminated, and real waterbody areas were precisely identified based on the SAR imagery. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, water boundaries extracted by this method were on manually drawn waterbody boundaries. Results of comparing the two methods show that they are pretty consistent with each other. Meanwhile, the results of our proposed method were compared with the results of three other kinds of water extraction algorithms commonly used for SAR imagery, in terms of the visual level, extraction accuracy, and running time. The running time of the proposed method meets the requirement of real-time application. The overlap degree of the extracted boundary in two pixels rating areas has reached 80%, which is obviously superior to other methods and the extraction results of the proposed method are also more significant in visual aspects such as boundary and detail information.

6903536,"A New Remote-Sensing-Based Indicator For Integrating Quantity And Quality Attributes To Assess The Dynamics Of Ecosystem Assets","Ecological benefits provided by ecosystem assets play an important role in improving human wellbeing. However, there are few feasible methods to combine data on the quantity and quality of ecosystem assets to describe their state and trend. Here, we developed a new remote-sensing-based indicator by synthesizing ecosystem asset quantity and quality data for effective assessment at a regional or national scale. The new indicator includes a typological ecosystem asset index (TEAI) (e.g., forest ecosystem asset index) and an integrated ecosystem asset index (IEAI). The TEAI and IEAI can be used to assess the state and trend of a specific ecosystem or set of regional ecosystems, respectively. We applied the new indicator in the context of ecological protection policy in the Three-Rivers Source Region (TRSR), a region known as the 'Chinese water tower'. From 2000 to 2015, the IEAI increased by 4.02\% due to an increase in the ecosystem asset area (0.2\%) and the ecosystem asset quality (0.66\% and 0.02\% increases in excellent and good level ecosystem assets, respectively). The implementation of ecological protection and ecological restoration programs was the main direct driver of regional ecological asset improvement. Our results suggest the new indicator is feasible for quickly and accurately evaluating the state and trend of ecosystem assets and can be used to guide ecosystem management at a large regional scale.

6862946,"Hybrid Bermudagrass And Tall Fescue Turfgrass Irrigation In Central California: Ii. Assessment Of Ndvi, Cwsi, And Canopy Temperature Dynamics","As the drought conditions persist in California and water continues to become less available, the development of methods to reduce water inputs is extremely important. Therefore, improving irrigation water use efficiency and developing water conservation strategies is crucial for maintaining urban green infrastructure. This two-year field irrigation project (2018-2019) focused on the application of optical and thermal remote sensing for turfgrass irrigation management in central California. We monitored the response of hybrid bermudagrass and tall fescue to varying irrigation treatments, including irrigation levels (percentages of reference evapotranspiration, ETo) and irrigation frequency. The ground-based remote sensing data included NDVI and canopy temperature, which was subsequently used to calculate the crop water stress index (CWSI). The measurements were done within two hours of solar noon under cloud-free conditions. The NDVI and canopy temperature data were collected 21 times in 2018 and 10 times in 2019. For the tall fescue, a strong relationship was observed between NDVI and visual rating (VR) values in both 2018 (r = 0.92) and 2019 (r = 0.83). For the hybrid bermudagrass, there was no correlation in 2018 and a moderate correlation (r = 0.72) in 2019. There was a moderate correlation of 0.64 and 0.88 in 2018 and 2019 between tall fescue canopy minus air temperature difference (dt) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for the lower CWSI baseline. The correlation between hybrid bermudagrass dt and VPD for the lower baseline was 0.69 in 2018 and 0.64 in 2019. Irrigation levels significantly impacted tall fescue canopy temperature but showed no significant effect on hybrid bermudagrass canopy temperature. For the same irrigation levels, increasing irrigation frequency slightly but consistently decreased canopy temperature without compromising the turfgrass quality. The empirical CWSI values violated the minimum expected value (of 0) 38\% of the time. Our results suggest NDVI thresholds of 0.6-0.65 for tall fescue and 0.5 for hybrid bermudagrass to maintain acceptable quality in the central California region. Further investigation is needed to verify the thresholds obtained in this study, particularly for hybrid bermudagrass, as the recommendation is only based on 2019 data. No CWSI threshold was determined to maintain turf quality in the acceptable range because of the high variability of CWSI values over time and their low correlation with VR values.","{""Haghverdi, Amir"",""Reiter, Maggie"",""Sapkota, Anish"",""Singh, Amninder""}","10.3390/agronomy11091733",2024-09-30 01:46:24,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2021,"{}","{""smart controller; evapotranspiration; autonomous landscape irrigation""}"
6903472,"Use Of Satellite Remote Sensing As A Monitoring Tool For Land And Water Resources Development Activities In An Indian Tropical Site","With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016–2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",NA,"10.1007/s10661-018-6770-8",2024-09-27 18:52:39,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6903630,"Nineteenth-Century Land-Use Legacies Affect Contemporary Land Abandonment In The Carpathians","Historical land use may shape landscapes for centuries into the future, but it remains unclear how much land-use legacies affect contemporary land use. Knowing for how long and how strongly land-use legacies affect agricultural systems is important for contemporary land-use planning and conservation. We assessed the effect of nineteenth-century agricultural legacies for contemporary agricultural abandonment by integrating historic maps and satellite imagery in the Carpathian region. We modeled the choice of agricultural land, and the legacies of Habsburg and Socialist regimes, while controlling for agro-ecological, accessibility and sociopolitical variation. Farming during the Habsburg era was concentrated in agro-ecologically suitable areas, but socialist agricultural expansion occurred mostly in less suitable areas, leading to subsequent abandonment. In addition, our results showed that historic land use affected abandonment even 100 years later. Although legacies diminished over time, their effects were amplified when political transformations occurred, likely due to land tenure systems, land owner attitudes, cultural values and differences in land improvement over time. Taken together, land-use legacies and shifts in political systems can constrain current land management and possible future land-use options, suggesting that contemporary land-use decisions can affect future land use for decades and even centuries.",NA,"10.1007/s10113-016-1097-x",2024-09-27 22:47:26,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6903503,"An Intelligent Hot-Desking Model Harnessing The Power Of Occupancy Sensing Data","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to harness occupancy sensing in a commercial hot-desking environment. Hot-desking is a method of office resource management designed to reduce the real estate costs of professional practices. However, the shortcoming is often in the suitability and appropriateness of allocated work environments. The Internet of Things could produce new data sets in the office at a resolution, speed and validity of which that they could be factored into desk-allocation, distributing seats based on appropriate noise levels, stay length, equipment requirements, previous presence and proximity to others working on the same project, among many others. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilises primary data from a commercial office environment in Central London (numerical building system data and semi-structured interviews) to feed a discrete events simulator. To test the hypothesis, the authors look at the potential for intelligent hot-desking to use ""work type"" data to improve the distribution of individuals in the office, increasing productivity through the creation of positive ""work type environments"" - where those working on specific tasks perform better when grouped with others doing the same task. The simulation runs for a typical work day, and the authors compare the intelligent hot-desking arrangement to a base case. Findings - The study shows that sensor data can be used for desk allocation in a hot-desking environment utilising activity-based working, with results that outweigh the costs of occupancy detection. The authors are not only able to optimise desk utilisation based on quality occupancy data but also demonstrate how overall productivity increases as individuals are allocated desks of their preference as much as possible among other enabling optimisations that can be applied. Moreover, the authors explore how an increase in occupancy data collection in the private sector could have key advantages for the business as an organization and the city as a whole. Research limitations/implications - The research explores only one possible incarnation of intelligent hot-desking, and the authors presume that all data have already been collected, and while not insurmountable, they do not discuss the technical or cultural difficulties to this end. Furthermore, final examination of the productivity benefit - because of the difficulty in defining and measuring the concept - is exploratory rather than definitive. This research suggests that not only human-centric smart building research should be prioritised over energy or space-based themes but also large-scale private sector collection of occupancy data may be imminent, and its potential should be examined. Practical implications - Findings strongly suggest that the hot-desking may cost more in lost productivity than it gains in reduced rental costs and as such many commercial offices should revaluate the transition, particularly with a view to facilitate intelligent hot-desking. Companies should begin to think strategically about the wider benefits of collecting occupancy data across their real estate portfolio, rather than reviewing use cases in silos. Finally, cities should consider scenarios of widespread collection of occupancy data in the private sector, examining the value these data have to city systems such as transport, and how the city might procure it for these ends. Social implications - This paper raises positive and negative social concerns. The value in occupancy data suggested herein, bringing with it the implication it should be collected en mass, has a noted concern that this brings privacy concerns. As such, policy and regulation should heed that current standards should be reviewed to ensure they are sufficient to protect those in offices from being unfairly discriminated, spied or exploited through occupancy data. However, the improved use of occupancy data improving workplaces could indeed make them more enjoyable places to work, and have the potential to become a staple in company's corporate social responsibility policies. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for better understanding the specific uses of occupancy data in the smart building mantra. Several sources suggest the current research focus on energy and rental costs is misguided when the holistic cost of an office is considered, and concepts related to staff although less understood - may have an order of magnitude bigger impact. This research supports this hypothesis through the example of intelligent hot-desking. The value of this paper lies in redirecting industry and research towards the considering occupancy data in smart building uses cases including - but not limited to-intelligent hot-desking.",NA,"10.1108/f-01-2016-0014",2024-09-27 23:17:29,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{spurious}",NA
6903596,"Floral Abundance And Richness Drive Beneficial Arthropod Conservation And Biological Control On Golf Courses","Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use, which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the biological control services of flying natural enemies and few investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50\% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of turfgrass pests.",NA,"10.1007/s11252-019-00907-0",2024-09-27 22:47:43,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{spurious}",NA

6903623,"Combining Hyper-Resolution Land Surface Modeling With Smap Brightness Temperatures To Obtain 30-M Soil Moisture Estimates","Accurate and detailed soil moisture information is essential for, among other things, irrigation, drought and flood prediction, water resources management, and field-scale (i.e., tens of m) decision making. Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales. Our results highlight the value of hyper-resolution modeling to bridge the gap between coarse-scale satellite retrievals and field-scale hydrological applications.",NA,"10.1016/j.rse.2020.111740",2024-09-27 22:32:15,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863516,"Effect Of Urbanization On The Dynamics Of Ecosystem Services: An Analysis For Decision Making In Kolkata Urban Agglomeration","Urbanization has profound influence on the changes of land use and land cover, which on the other hand exert significant impact on ecosystem services and their values, especially in the urban agglomerations. Kolkata urban agglomeration of India has been selected to determine the causes in changes of ecosystem services under present and projected land use land cover scenario. Land use land cover maps of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were prepared by support vector machine method, using LANDSAT satellite imageries and projected up-to 2040 using CA-Markov model. Built-up land was increased by 65.39\% during 1990-2020 and will further increase to 76.88\% by 2040. Built-up lands are mainly encroaching crop lands and wetlands. During the period of fifty years (1990-2040), the ecosystem service value will decrease from \$38,486.49 to \$28,060.79, with annual rate of decrement of 0.54\%. During the same period, the spatial extent of very low ecosystem service value will be increased from 16.60 to 58.88\%; whereas, the area coverage of very high ecosystem service value will be decreased from 2.69 to 2.35\%. Water supply contributed highest ecosystem service value followed by disturbance regulation and nutrient cycling; whereas, lacking in soil formation, pollination and biological control services contributed lowest. The study will help in decision making process for sustainable management of natural resources and also provide useful guideline for the quality improvement in urban ecosystems.","{""Adhikary, Partha Pratim"",""Bera, Biswajit"",""Das, Subhasis"",""Kumar Shit, Pravat""}","10.1007/s11252-022-01246-3",2024-07-12 23:27:49,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""CA-Markov model; Ecosystem service value (ESV); Land use; land cover (LULC); Scenario analysis for E""}"
6863063,"Mapping Of Soils And Land-Related Environmental Attributes In Modern Agriculture Systems Using Geomatics","The need for reliable information about soil water has become increasingly necessary in recent times. Which represent an important input data into ecological, hydrological, or land surface models. A total number of 460 soil samples were collected to perform inverse distance weighting (IDW) estimates to map some soil quality properties. Moreover, soil profiles were used to apply geo-statistical analysis. Maps were produced with available soil information on soil texture and organic matter. Their unknown reliability hampers the estimation of the accuracy of models that rely on soil information. The hydraulic properties of field soils can improve predictions for such models using remote sensing data (RS). Scientific study and models application at various geographic scales can both benefit from a reliable soil water map. It is also essential for the development and spatial implementation of the comprehensive soil quality index (SQ) planned in the examined study. The assessment of soil suitability for agricultural purposes was based on important physical, chemical and environmental parameters. It is indicated that 81\% of the samples fall within the moderately appropriate category S-2. These samples are found in the upper and middle parts of the investigated area. The remaining percentage (19\%), located in the south of the region, was marginally suitable for class S-3. The calculated coefficients were also used in addition to estimating the suitability of irrigation. Accordingly, most areas are unsuitable for (surface) irrigation under natural conditions and require a special type of irrigation method. Improving irrigation management techniques and using appropriate plants is the basis of irrigation water management according to soil characteristics.","{""AbdelRahman, Mohamed A.

They provide constructive information to emergency and disaster managers, critical infrastructure providers, the insurance industry, and wider society. Post-eruption clean-up of tephra deposits is a prevalent and expensive (time and resource) activity which is often not planned for. Here, we present an overview of the clean-up efforts undertaken in four communities after the VEI 4 eruption of Calbuco volcano in 2015. We narratively reconstruct clean-up efforts in Ensenada (Chile), Junín de los Andes (Argentina), San Martín de los Andes (Argentina), and Villa La Angostura (Argentina) using semi-structured interviews, syn- and post-deposition photographs, pre- and post-event visual spectrum satellite imagery, and media reports. We compare these reconstructions with estimates based on a geospatial modelling approach adapted from Hayes et al. (Journal of Applied Volcanology 6:1; 2017). Specifically, we compare reported and geospatially derived estimates for volume of tephra removed, and clean-up operation duration. Our modelling approach performed well for Junín de los Andes but did not adequately capture volume and clean-up operation duration for the three remaining case study locations. We discuss several sources of uncertainty (including observational errors and natural variance of tephra deposit thickness), reported tephra removal volume estimates, clean-up methods, land use, and temporal evolution of clean-up operation demand. Our work demonstrates the utility of using simple geospatial data to develop assessments for tephra clean-up for use in response and recovery planning, and quantitative volcanic impact and risk assessments. © 2019 The Author(s).",NA,"10.1186/s13617-019-0087-3",2024-10-01 17:53:56,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

Urban sprawl is examined by studying land-use land-cover change from 1998 to 2016. Changes in spatial characteristics of urban land cover are further verified using Shannon's entropy. The impact of urban sprawl is examined by computing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) values. Land surface temperature (LST) is also calculated using thermal band of multi-temporal Landsat data. Regression analysis is used to calculate the correlation between LST and NDVI, NDWI and NDBI. The study showed a negative correlation between NDVI, NDWI and LST and a positive correlation between NDBI and LST. Urban areas in Surat have grown an approximately 60.41 sq.km, a 102\% increase while surface temperature in Surat inner city has risen by 5.1 degrees C during the study period.

6862781,"Classification Of Expansive Grassland Species In Different Growth Stages Based On Hyperspectral And Lidar Data","Expansive species classification with remote sensing techniques offers great support for botanical field works aimed at detection of their distribution within areas of conservation value and assessment of the threat caused to natural habitats. Large number of spectral bands and high spatial resolution allows for identification of particular species. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data provide information about areas such as vegetation structure. Because the species differ in terms of features during the growing season, it is important to know when their spectral responses are unique in the background of the surrounding vegetation. The aim of the study was to identify two expansive grass species: Molinia caerulea and Calamagrostis epigejos in the Natura 2000 area in Poland depending on the period and dataset used. Field work was carried out during late spring, summer and early autumn, in parallel with remote sensing data acquisition. Airborne 1-m resolution HySpex images and LiDAR data were used. HySpex images were corrected geometrically and atmospherically before Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation and vegetation indices calculation. Based on a LiDAR point cloud generated Canopy Height Model, vegetation structure from discrete and full-waveform data and topographic indexes were generated. Classifications were performed using a Random Forest algorithm. The results show post-classification maps and their accuracies: Kappa value and F1 score being the harmonic mean of producer (PA) and user (UA) accuracy, calculated iteratively. Based on these accuracies and botanical knowledge, it was possible to assess the best identification date and dataset used for analysing both species. For M. caerulea the highest median Kappa was 0.85 (F1 = 0.89) in August and for C. epigejos 0.65 (F1 = 0.73) in September. For both species, adding discrete or full-waveform LiDAR data improved the results. We conclude that hyperspectral (HS) and LiDAR airborne data could be useful to identify grassland species encroaching into Natura 2000 habitats and for supporting their monitoring. © 2018 by the authors.","{""Bzdȩga, K."",""Jarocińska, A."",""Marcinkowska-Ochtyra, A."",""Tokarska-Guzik, B.""}","10.3390/rs10122019",2024-07-18 21:58:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{calibration}","{Conservation,""Data acquisition"",""Decision trees"",""Different growth stages"",Ecosystems,""Expansive grass species"",Forestry,""Grass species"",""Hydraulic structures"",Hyperspectral,""Iterative methods"",LiDAR,""Lithium compounds"",Mapping,""Natura 2000"",""Random Forest"",""Remote sensing"",Vegetation}"

Methods: First, environmental factors are selected based on mutual information method.Then,the selected environmental factors are taken as the input varia‑bles of long short‑term memory(LSTM) model,and the accumulated displacement data of landslide are taken as the expected output data,and the parameters of the model are optimized through improved particle swarm optimization method, so as to further improve the prediction accuracy of the fusion model.The global navigation satellite system(GNSS) data of Fa'er landslide in Shuicheng County, Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province are analyzed. Results: Experimental results show that the improved particle swarm optimization(IPSO)‑LSTM neural network data fusion algorithm, based on mutual information is suitable for landslide deformation prediction with multi‑source heterogeneous monitoring data.The environmental factor variable selection method based on mutual information is better than Pearson correlation coefficient selection method. After optimizing the parameters of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, the prediction accuracy of the fusion model is higher. Conclusions: The proposed fusion prediction model has high prediction accuracy in landslide cumulative displacement prediction,which has important reference value for improving the reliability of landslide monitoring and early warning. It should be noted that only a few typical environmental factors are collected. In practical application, other factors such as groundwater level, soil moisture and human activities can be considered to further improve the prediction accuracy and reliability of the fusion model. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

6862748,"Sar-Based Subsidence Monitoring And Assessment Of The Factors Involved In The Occurrence Of Subsidence, Lahore City","The judicious use and management of natural resources is vital to achieve sustainable development. Land and water are prime natural resources, and their depletion and degradation can lead to serious threats like land subsidence. Land subsidence is a phenomenon of the alteration of elevation at a point on the earth through the sinking of the surface. It occurs when the earth’s surface loses its support. The major causes of land subsidence include groundwater extraction, mining, construction overload, and other similar factors that increase pressure on the surface and eventually subsidize the land. Urban centers with excessive groundwater extraction and infra-structure development are at a high risk of subsidence. Lahore, the second-largest city in Pakistan, is undergoing an enormous increase in population density, uncontrolled urbanization with very large-scale construction projects, and intensive groundwater extraction which are responsible for subsidence directly or indirectly. Therefore, studies on groundwater status and unplanned urban appraisals have seriously urged monitoring of the subsidence in La-hore. Herein, we used freely available Sentinel-1 data for one year (from August 2018 to August 2019), with a high spatial and temporal resolution, to monitor subsidence in Lahore. The data were processed using the SNAP/StaMPS approach for Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI) analysis, which is an advanced InSAR technique. The displacement velocity map from InSAR processing shows a significant land deformation in the area with values ranging from −114 to 15 mm yr–1. Along with the Sentinel-1 data, we also used supplementary data obtained from various government agencies of Pakistan to study the land cover map, transportation network and waterways of Lahore, soil types, population density, and field points for assessing the results and understanding the roles of various factors in the occurrence of uplift or subsidence. A strong correlation was established between subsidence and various parameters such as groundwater extraction and lowering of the water table, soil type variations, land cover changes, surface water channels, and population density. The deformation map confirms the greatest subsidence in the central part of Lahore, while the uplift is observed in the less populated and rural areas situated near Ravi River. The land subsidence and uplift could be attributed to groundwater extraction and recharge through the canal system and the river, respectively. © 2022, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

6863301,"Tamsat-Alert V1: A New Framework For Agricultural Decision Support","Early warning of weather-related hazards enables farmers, policy makers and aid agencies to mitigate their exposure to risk. We present a new operational framework, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground based measurements-AgricuLtural EaRly warning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT), which aims to provide early warning for meteorological risk to agriculture. TAMSAT-ALERT combines information on land-surface properties, seasonal forecasts and historical weather to quantitatively assess the likelihood of adverse weather-related outcomes, such as low yield. This article describes the modular TAMSAT-ALERT framework and demonstrates its application to risk assessment for low maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale). The modular design of TAMSAT-ALERT enables it to accommodate any impact or land-surface model driven with meteorological data. The implementation described here uses the well-established General Large Area Model (GLAM) for annual crops to provide probabilistic assessments of the meteorological hazard for maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale) throughout the growing season. The results show that climatic risk to yield is poorly constrained in the beginning of the season, but as the season progresses, the uncertainty is rapidly reduced. Based on the assessment for the period 2002-2011, we show that TAMSAT-ALERT can estimate the meteorological risk on maize yield 6 to 8 weeks in advance of harvest. The TAMSAT-ALERT methodology implicitly weights forecast and observational inputs according to their relevance to the metric being assessed. A secondary application of TAMSAT-ALERT is thus an evaluation of the usefulness of meteorological forecast products for impact assessment. Here, we show that in northern Ghana (Tamale), the tercile seasonal forecasts of seasonal cumulative rainfall and mean temperature, which are routinely issued to farmers, are of limited value because regional and seasonal temperature and rainfall are poorly correlated with yield. This finding speaks to the pressing need for meteorological forecast products that are tailored for individual user applications. © Author(s) 2018.","{""Asfaw, D."",""Black, E."",""Brown, M."",""Challinor, A."",""Jane Nicklin, K."",""Maidment, R."",""Otu-Larbi, F."",""Pinnington, E."",""Quaife, T.""}","10.5194/gmd-11-2353-2018",2024-07-19 18:16:49,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{maybe,""check it out""}","{Ghana,""Northern Region [Ghana]"",Tamale,""Zea mays"",agriculture,""crop yield"",""decision support system"",""early warning system"",""environmental risk"",""land surface"",maize,""meteorological hazard"",rainfall,risk,""risk assessment"",""satellite data"",temperature}"

Waste dumping is the main method of solid waste disposal during the thirty past years. The conditions show that the present site is quite unsuitable because many principles and criteria for site selection are not considered. So in the near future, the severe environmental impacts will threats the health of Sanandaj's inhabitants. The research attempts to integrate fuzzy logic and GIS with the help of Remote Sensing in selecting the most suitable area for the waste disposal.

6862755,"Subpixel Land-Cover Classification For Improved Urban Area Estimates Using Landsat","Urban areas are Earth's fastest growing land use that impact hydrological and ecological systems and the surface energy balance. The identification and extraction of accurate spatial information relating to urban areas is essential for future sustainable city planning owing to its importance within global environmental change and human-environment interactions. However, monitoring urban expansion using medium resolution (30-250 m) imagery remains challenging due to the variety of surface materials that contribute to measured reflectance resulting in spectrally mixed pixels. This research integrates high spatial resolution orthophotos and Landsat imagery to identify differences across a range of diverse urban subsets within the rapidly expanding Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR), Western Australia. Results indicate that calibrating Landsat-derived subpixel land-cover estimates with correction values (calculated from spatially explicit comparisons of subpixel Landsat values to classified high-resolution data which accounts for over {[}under] estimations of Landsat) reduces moderate resolution urban area over (under) estimates by on an average 55.08\% for thePMR. This approach can be applied to other urban areas globally through use of frequently available and/ or low-cost high spatial resolution imagery (e. g. using Google Earth). This will improve urban growth estimations to help monitor and measure change whilst providing metrics to facilitate sustainable urban development targets within cities around the world.","{""Biggs, Eloise"",""Boruff, Bryan"",""MacLachlan, Andrew"",""Roberts, Gareth""}","10.1080/01431161.2017.1346403",2024-07-19 19:18:19,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}",NA

6691567,"Extending Data for Urban Health Decision-Making: a Menu of New and Potential Neighborhood-Level Health Determinants Datasets in LMICs","Area-level indicators of the determinants of health are vital to plan and monitor progress toward targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tools such as the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) and UN Habitat Urban Inequities Surveys identify dozens of area-level health determinant indicators that decisionmakers can use to track and attempt to address population health burdens and inequalities. However, questions remain as to how such indicators can be measured in a cost-effective way. Area-level health determinants reflect the physical, ecological, and social environments that influence health outcomes at community and societal levels, and include, among others, access to quality health facilities, safe parks, and other urban services, traffic density, level of informality, level of air pollution, degree of social exclusion, and extent of social networks. The identification and disaggregation of indicators is necessarily constrained by which datasets are available. Typically, these include household- and individual-level survey, census, administrative, and health system data. However, continued advancements in earth observation (EO), geographical information system (GIS), and mobile technologies mean that new sources of area-level health determinant indicators derived from satellite imagery, aggregated anonymized mobile phone data, and other sources are also becoming available at granular geographic scale. Not only can these data be used to directly calculate neighborhood- and city-level indicators, they can be combined with survey, census, administrative and health system data to model household- and individual-level outcomes (e.g., population density, household wealth) with tremendous detail and accuracy. WorldPop and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have already modeled dozens of household survey indicators at country or continental scales at resolutions of 1 × 1 km or even smaller. This paper aims to broaden perceptions about which types of datasets are available for health and development decision-making. For data scientists, we flag area-level indicators at city and sub-city scales identified by health decision-makers in the SDGs, Urban HEART, and other initiatives. For local health decision-makers, we summarize a menu of new datasets that can be feasibly generated from EO, mobile phone, and other spatial data—ideally to be made free andpublicly available—and offer lay descriptions of some of the difficulties in generating such data products.","{""Thomson, Dana""}","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-019-00363-3",2024-04-22 23:31:47,"excluded","{""Value is not measured"",""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Spatial data|Gis|Satellite imagery|Mobile phone data""}"
6903545,"Predicting Occurrence, Abundance, And Fruiting Of A Cultural Keystone Species To Inform Landscape Values And Priority Sites For Habitat Enhancements","Environmental niche modeling is an increasingly common tool in conservation and management of non-timber species. In particular, models of species' habitats have been aided by new advances in remote sensing and it is now possible to relate forest structure variables to understory species at a relatively high resolution over large spatial scales. Here, we model landscape responses for a culturally-valued keystone shrub, velvet-leaf blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloidesMichaux), in northeast Alberta, Canada, to better understand the environmental factors promoting or limiting its occurrence, abundance, and fruit production, and to guide regional planning. Occurrence and abundance were measured at 845 and 335 sites, respectively, with both strongly related to land cover type and topo-edaphic factors. However, their influence varied widely, reflecting differences in the processes affecting occurrence and abundance. We then used airborne laser scanning (ALS) to characterize horizontal forest canopy cover for the study area, and related this and other geospatial variables to patterns in fruit production where we demonstrated a five-fold increase in fruit production from closed to open forest stands. We then simulated forest canopy thinning across the study area to identify places where gains in fruit production would be greatest following natural disturbance or directed management (e.g., thinning, prescribed burning). Finally, we suggest this approach could be used to identify sites for habitat enhancements to offset direct (land use change) or indirect (access) losses of resources in areas impacted with resource extraction activities, or simply to increase a culturally-valued resource through management.",NA,"10.3390/f11070783",2024-09-26 00:52:07,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

A Psychosocial Approach Applied To Coastal Development","Purpose This work critiques the situation of the ecological and cultural heritage in many coastal territories and analyses how current land planning methodologies are responding to it. The study builds a new integrated approach founded on ecocultural values and local knowledge as resources for an effective territorial planning and sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework was developed through: (1) analysing coastal planning needs and problems in European coastal areas; (2) identifying ecocultural values, including local knowledge, in such areas; (3) selecting best approaches and tools in spatial planning; (4) applying the selected planning approaches to use ecocultural values as resources for spatial planning and sustainable development; and (5) validating the final methodology. Findings A dynamic approach for maritime-land planning was developed projecting coastal waters and river basins as strategic drivers for sustainable development, based on the natural capacity of water to shape and integrate the ecological and cultural territory. A participatory governance planning methodology supports the new articulations of space based on ecocultural value chains and networks as synergistic vectors, focusing on local knowledge as psychosocial capital for a collective mapping of cultural, historical, social, economic and ecological values into ecocultural littoral plans.

6863247,"Mapping An Alien Invasive Shrub Within Conservation Corridors Using Super-Resolution Satellite Imagery","Alien invasive plant species are one of the main drivers of global biodiversity loss. Methods for monitoring the spread of alien invasive plants are needed to improve management and mitigate impact on local biodiversity. Recent advances in deep learning and image fusion holds great potential for mapping and managing alien invasive plants. One such method is super-resolution image reconstruction, where a neural network learns to downscale images from coarse to fine resolution. Within the commercial timber production landscape of KwaZulu-Natal, endangered grassland corridors are threatened by American bramble invasion, impacting plants, birds, arthropods, and soil restoration. Here we aim to improve our understanding of bramble invasion dynamics through using super-resolved satellite mosaics. Bramble was classified with very high accuracies (85\%) from the super-resolved satellite mosaic, compared to other conventional satellite imagery with different spectral and spatial resolutions. Using landscape analyses, we identified plantation tree harvesting and prescribed burning to be major drivers increasing bramble cover within the landscape. Bramble cover was highest one year following plantation tree harvesting. Continuous prescribed burning positively influenced bramble. Bramble cover was also high close to streams, and under future invasion projections, bramble will severely impact Ensifera species alongside low priority grasshopper species habitat. Results also indicate that bramble has a significant negative impact on intermediate priority grasshoppers and plant species richness. For controlling bramble invasion within commercial timber production landscapes, we recommend the adoption rotational harvesting, as harvesting entire plantation blocks throughout the landscape will dramatically increase invasion potential of bramble. Current bramble removal programmes should prioritize riparian areas. Special attention is needed to control bramble one year after timber harvesting, as this is when bramble cover is highest. We show the benefits of using super-resolved mosaics to gain new insights into alien invasive species dynamics, while further development of this technique will aid in managing invasive alien plant species at local scales.","{""Latte, Nicolas"",""Pryke, James S."",""Samways, Michael J."",""Theron, Jurie""}","10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116023",2024-07-18 21:17:42,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Conservation corridors; Plantation forestry; Remote sensing; Deep learning; Rubus cuneifolius; Manag""}"
6862802,"4d-Trajectory Air Traffic Management: Are There 'Killer Apps'? - Part 2","The USA and Europe are developing plans - NextGen and SESAR - to transform the processes of Air Traffic Management (ATM). These will improve safety and efficiency, and match predicted increases in air transportation demand. They use advanced networking technology updated with information from satellite navigation and digital non-voice communication. The strategic goal, envisaged for 15-20 years hence, is a new ATM paradigm. Aircraft would fly on Four-Dimensional (4D) trajectories, incorporating altitude, position, time, and other aircraft positions and vectors. This vision would involve extremely large investments from the airline industry and ATM service providers. Thus, development priorities need to be based on sound business cases. But will these necessarily lead to the strategic vision of a 4D-trajectory system? Will the changes in practice be limited to a series of short and medium term operational improvements rather than strategic improvements? So, are there 'Killer Apps' for 4D-trajectory ATM? 'Killer App(lication)s' is jargon for innovations so valuable that they prove the core value of some larger technology. Killer Apps generate high degrees of stakeholder technical and financial cooperation. Ironically, most past ATM Killer Apps have improved safety, e. g., modern radar data processing led to collision avoidance systems. The analysis here attempts to identify and then size potential 4D-trajectory ATM Killer Apps. The evidence for Killer Apps has to pass key tests. Killer Apps obviously have to offer enormous benefits to stakeholders in the context of the potential costs. The bulk of these benefits must not be obtainable through technologically 'cut down' non-4D-trajectory versions. Part 1 of this paper (Brooker, 2012a) sets out the framework for investigating these questions. Part 2 examines potential Killer Apps derived from improvements in Fuel Efficiency, Capacity and Cost.

6863362,"Integrating Soil Moisture Retrieved From L-Band Microwave Radiation Into An Energy Balance Model To Improve Evapotranspiration Estimation On The Irrigated Oases Of Arid Regions In Northwest China","Irrigated oases are the main water consumers in arid and semi-arid regions. As plant evapotranspiration (ET) in these regions mainly depends on irrigated water, accurate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) on the irrigated oases is crucial for allocation and management of irrigation water resources. In this study, we integrated the soil moisture retrieved from Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometer (PLMR) into the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model for improving ET estimates under water stress conditions. The study area is the irrigated oasis in the middle reaches of the Heihe River where airborne and satellite-borne remotely sensed data as well as in situ observations are available through the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (Hi WATER). The main goal of this experiment is to monitor the energy-water exchange between near-surface atmosphere and land surface, and to assess its influencing factors within the oasis-desert ecosystem. The soil moisture data were retrieved using the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model fed with the airborne dual-polarized and multi-angular viewing of PLMR. The comparison of soil moisture retrieval from PLMR data with the soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) showed good consistency, with an absolute mean error (ME) <0.004 cm(3) cm(-3) and a root mean square error (RMSE) value <0.05 cm(3) cm(-3). Further, the actual daily evapotranspiration was estimated using the soil moisture integrated (SM-integrated) SEBS algorithm fed with the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images and soil moisture data retrieved from PLMR data. The sensible heat fluxes and daily evapotranspiration-(ETdatiy) obtained by the SM-integrated SEBS and the original SEBS were compared with the eddy correlation (EC) measurements collected from HiWATER experiment. The results indicate an obvious improvement when soil moisture information is integrated into the SEBS. This method overcomes the weakness of remote sensing based (RS-based) surface energy balance models of overestimating evapotranspiration particularly in semi-arid and arid regions. It shows a prospect that the combination of optical and microwave remote sensing can further improve the RS-based ET estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated nest site selection and the effects of land use on its distribution in a multi-scale approach using nest positions obtained during three consecutive breeding seasons. We identified two environmental predictors, namely Tasseled cap 1 (a range value of land brightness) and slope, and three variables derived from human use (house densities, unpaved roads and fences) as the best predictors of occurrence of the species. Only slope had a positive and significant effect on stonechat occurrence; the rest being negative. Results were not restricted by the scale, indicating that design of special protection areas should be developed considering the landscape scale. Our results provide a robust prediction of the species distribution throughout Fuerteventura, demonstrating that our approach can also cope for the low vegetation signal within small arid regions such as islands. Future land use planning and management for the island should avoid the presence of negative impact elements such as opening new roads and new urbanisations in nearby habitats with the highest probabilities of species occurrence.

To address the issues, we collected data from multiple sources to assess mangrove ecosystem variation due to both natural factors and human impacts in the Ba and Rewa deltas, Fiji. Landsat satellite data were used to map the land use and cover of the study area from 2000 to 2020. Questionnaire surveys were conducted to identify the main uses of mangroves that could influence mangrove ecosystems. Over the period investigated, the mangrove area increased by 572 ha (by 12\%) in Ba and decreased by 697 ha (by 9\%) in Rewa. The social survey revealed that 45\% of respondents in the Ba delta and 20\% in the Rewa delta visited the mangrove area daily in search of food resources. The net annual economic loss and lost functioning of mangroves as an anthropogenic CO2 reservoir caused by mangrove degradation in the two deltas were estimated to be 335,000 USD and 202 t-C, respectively.

6863097,"The Role Of Agroforestry In Restoring Brazil's Atlantic Forest: Opportunities And Challenges For Smallholder Farmers","1. Restoring the degraded Atlantic Forest is one of the biggest conservation challenges in Brazil. In a biome with high human presence, understanding the potential for restoration approaches, such as agroforestry, to provide benefits to smallholder farmers and biodiversity is essential in developing equitable restoration strategies. 2. Smallholder or family farmers are essential to national food security, producing most fruit and vegetables consumed in Brazil. Their farms can also provide ecological stepping stones for biodiversity. To better understand their role in Atlantic Forest restoration, this study explores the use of agroforestry by smallholder farmers from the Movimento Sem Terra (MST), the Rural Landless Workers' Movement, in Pontal do Paranapanema. 3. We use quantitative and qualitative data to assess farmer perceptions of the measures which support agroforestry farming, barriers to implementation and its impact on indicators of wellbeing. We find agroforestry farmers report significant benefits in 8 of 18 tested indicators. Attitudes to agroforestry are varied, but common themes emerge including the high value of tree cover for shade and cooling effects, and the difficulties in selling agroforestry products.

6862813,"An Assessment Of The Accuracy Of Modis Land Surface Temperature Over Egypt Using Ground-Based Measurements","Space-based data have provided important advances in understanding climate systems and processes in arid and semi-arid regions, which are hot-spot regions in terms of climate change and variability. This study assessed the performance of land surface temperatures (LSTs), retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, over Egypt. Eight-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST data were aggregated and validated against near-surface seasonal and annual observational maximum and minimum air temperatures using data from 34 meteorological stations spanning the period from July 2002 to June 2015. A variety of accuracy metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of LST, including the bias, normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE), Yule-Kendall (YK) skewness measure, and Spearman's rho coefficient. The ability of LST to reproduce the seasonal cycle, anomalies, temporal variability, and the distribution of warm and cold tails of observational temperatures was also evaluated. Overall, the results indicate better performance of the nighttime LSTs compared to the daytime LSTs. Specifically, while nighttime LST tended to underestimate the minimum air temperature during winter, spring, and autumn on the order of -1.3, -1.2, and -1.4 degrees C, respectively, daytime LST markedly overestimated the maximum air temperature in all seasons, with values mostly above 5 degrees C. Importantly, the results indicate that the performance of LST over Egypt varies considerably as a function of season, lithology, and land use. LST performs better during transitional seasons (i.e., spring and autumn) compared to solstices (i.e., winter and summer). The varying interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially the differences between sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute largely to these seasonal variations. Spatially, LST performs better in areas with sandstone formations and quaternary sediments and, conversely, shows lower accuracy in regions with limestone, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. This behavior can be expected in hybrid arid and semi-arid regions like Egypt, where bare rocks contribute to the majority of the Egyptian territory, with a lack of vegetation cover. The low surface albedo of igneous and limestone rocks may explain the remarkable overestimation of daytime temperature in these regions, compared to the bright formations of higher surface albedo (i.e., sandy deserts and quaternary rocks). Overall, recalling the limited coverage of meteorological stations in Egypt, this study demonstrates that LST obtained from the MODIS product can be trustworthily employed as a surrogate for or a supplementary source to near-surface measurements, particularly for minimum air temperature. On the other hand, some bias correction techniques should be applied to daytime LSTs. In general, the fine space-based climatic information provided by MODIS LST can be used for a detailed spatial assessment of climate variability in Egypt, with important applications in several disciplines such as water resource management, hydrological modeling, agricultural management and planning, urban climate, biodiversity, and energy consumption, amongst others. Also, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the applications of remote sensing technology in assessing climatic feedbacks and interactions in arid and semi-arid regions, opening new avenues for developing innovative algorithms and applications specifically addressing issues related to these regions.","{""El Kenawy, Ahmed M."",""Hereher, Mohamed E."",""Robaa, Sayed M.""}","10.3390/rs11202369",2024-07-19 19:00:15,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{calibration}","{""air temperature; MODIS; LST; validation; lithology; Egypt""}"
6863067,"Model-Based Assessment Of The Pattern Differences And The Equity Of National Carbon Emissions In China During 2000-2010","Land cover information of China was extracted using the supervised classification of remote sensing data and the carbon sink and carbon emissions of each province were calculated by combining the statistical data with the method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 listing. With the newly built 3E model, the three indexes of ESI (ecological support index), EDI (equitable distribution index) and EEI (economic efficiency index) were calculated and their spatial pattern characteristics and regional differences over time were analyzed. The research results indicated that as the forest coverage rate increased, the carbon sink of the ecosystem in China also increased. ESI in the central and western China was tending to decrease, while ESI in the eastern coast was growing. Although the EEI gap between eastern China and western China was large, their EDI value gap was becoming shrinking as the economic growth shifted towards the central China and western China. The 3E values which were calculated with the consideration of ecology, equity and efficiency for China's carbon emissions indicated that the carbon emissions in half provinces of China were in good conditions, with benign ecosystem circulation, fairness and high economic efficiency in the recent 11 years. These results could act as references for China's low carbon economic development and also could provide guidance for the spatial pattern planning of China's carbon emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

6691516,"Essential Earth observation variables for high-level multi-scale indicators and policies","Several holistic approaches are based on the description of socio-ecological systems to address the sustainability challenge. Essential Variables (EVs) have the potential to support these approaches by describing the status of the Earth system through monitoring and modeling. The different classes of EVs can be organized along the environmental policy framework of Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses. The EV concept represents an opportunity to strengthen monitoring systems by providing observations to seize the fundamental dimensions of the Earth system The Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is a partnership of 113 nations and 134 participating organizations in 2021 that are dedicated to making Earth Observation (EO) data available globally to inform about the state of the environment and enable data-driven decision processes. GEO is building the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, a set of coordinated and independent EO, information and processing systems that interoperate to provide access to EO for users in the public and private sectors. The progresses made in the development of various classes of EVs are described with their main policy targets, Internet links and key references The paper reviews the literature on EVs and describes the main contributions of the EU GEOEssential project to integrate EVs within the work plan of GEO in order to better address selected environmental policies and the SDGs. A new GEO-EVs community has been set to discuss about the current status of the EVs, exchange knowledge, experiences and assess the gaps to be solved in their communities of providers and users.

6863013,"Integrating Forest Cover Change And Carbon Storage Dynamics: Leveraging Google Earth Engine And Invest Model To Inform Conservation In Hilly Regions","Forests are vital in combating climate change by storing and sequestrating CO2 from the atmosphere. Measuring the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on the capacity of carbon storage (CS) within forest eco-systems presents a significant challenge. This study employs remote sensing techniques to examine the changes in spatiotemporal patterns of CS in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), resulting from LULC alterations between 1996 and 2021. LULC change patterns were identified for six different years utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model was combined with GEE to evaluate the changing patterns of CS. The study discovered that the CHT region experienced a loss of 21.65 x 10(6) Mg of CS, owing to a 21\% reduction in vegetation cover (2862.85 km<\^{}>2) during the study period. The central city area (Chittagong) accounted for the most significant loss of CS (7.99 x 10(6) Mg), while the suburban areas of Khagrachari (0.92 x 10(6) Mg) and Rangamati (3.53 x 106 Mg) contributed the least. The multiple regression model revealed that elevation and vegetation characteristics significantly influenced CS. The findings underscore the importance of developing policies and strategies that mitigate the adverse effects of land cover change on CS, and advocate for sustainable forest management practices that strike a balance between ecological, social, and economic concerns.","{""Al Kafy, Abdulla"",""Bakshi, Arpita"",""Duti, Bushra Monowar"",""Fattah, Md.

This study aims to develop an index called the urban green accessibility (UGA) index, which measures people's accessibility to green space and represents the citywide or local characteristics of the distribution pattern of green space. The index is defined as the sum of pedestrians' accessibility to all vegetation points, which consists of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with integration and choice values from angular segment analysis. In this study, the proposed index is tested with cases of New York, NY, and San Francisco, CA, in the US. The results reveal differences based on the significance of streets. When analysis ranges are on a neighborhood scale, a few hotspots appear in well-known green areas on commonly accessible streets and in local neighborhood parks on residential blocks. The appearance of high-accessibility points in low-NDVI areas implies the potential of the efficient and proper distribution of green spaces for pedestrians. The proposed measure is expected to help in planning and managing green areas in cities, taking people's accessibility and spatial relationships into consideration.","{""Cho, Hyemin"",""Jang, Kee Moon"",""Kim, Jaeman"",""Kim, Youngchul"",""Lee, Hye-Yeong""}","10.3390/ijgi9100586",2024-10-03 17:43:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""green space; urban management; network analysis; aerial image; pedestrian""}"
6863394,"Detecting Montane Flowering Phenology With Cubesat Imagery","Shifts in wildflower phenology in response to climate change are well documented in the scientific literature. The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (<10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen's kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen's kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt. Rainier National Park, the modeling framework presented here could be a useful tool to manage and prioritize park resources. © 2020 by the authors.","{""HilleRisLambers, J."",""John, A."",""Olden, J.

6863711,"Monte-Carlo Value Analysis Of High-Throughput Satellites: Value Levers, Tradeoffs, And Implications For Operators And Investors","High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) are a distinctive class of communication satellites that provide significantly more throughput per allocated bandwidth than traditional wide-beam communication satellites. They are the proverbial wave of creative disruption in the space industry and are poised to disrupt the communication market in significant ways. The objective of this work is to develop a decision-analytic framework for assessing the value of High-Throughput Satellites and to provide meaningful results of the value of such systems under realistic design, operational, and market conditions. We develop the cost and revenue models of HTS. To build the revenue model, we develop a hybrid data-driven and scenario-based load factor model that combines historical data based on financial records from current HTS operators with extrapolations based on best-, nominal-, and worst-case scenarios. We then integrate the cost and revenue models within a stochastic simulation environment and perform Monte-Carlo analysis of the net present value (NPV) of HTS. One important result is that a medium-sized HTS significantly outperforms a roughly equivalent traditional wide-beam satellite, even under the worst-case loading scenario. Another important result, here identified and quantified, is the tradeoff between the average revenue per user (ARPU) and average loading of the satellite and how it is mediated by the downlink speed provided to consumers. This result can be used in different ways, for example, by helping define the boundaries of what is competitively achievable in terms of ARPU and downlink speed offerings. The implications of these results are that they delineate the pathways to financial failure and the boundaries beyond which an HTS will be value-negative, or alternatively, the asymptotic minimum values for an HTS to be value-positive.","{""Geng, Fan"",""Gomez, David B."",""Guan, Yue"",""Saleh, Joseph Homer""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0222133",2024-07-17 21:47:23,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2019,"{communications}",NA
6862910,"Investigation Of Potential Of Solar Photovoltaic System As An Alternative Electric Supply On The Tropical Island Of Mantanani Sabah Malaysia","This article reports on the potential use of a photovoltaic solar system on Mantanani Island. This island has its attractions in terms of flora and fauna as well as the uniqueness of its local community. The electricity supply status of the island is minimal, and the local electricity provider only provides two units of electrical generator that only supply energy from 18:00 to 06:00. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that if the target resident can obtain a better electricity supply, they can generate higher income and improve their standard of living. This study aims to identify the status of solar energy sources, estimate the basic electrical load, and conduct a techno-economic analysis of homestay enterprises of residents. Geostationary satellite data on solar energy resources were gathered and analyzed using Solargis. The electricity load was calculated based on the daily routine activities of the residents and usage of primary electrical appliances. Techno-economic analysis was done by determining the key parameters to calculate the return on investment and payback period. The results showed that Mantanani Island had great potential for implementing a photovoltaic system, by the estimated value of the total annual solar energy and peak sun hour of 1.447 MWh/m(2)/y and 4.05 h, respectively. The variation in total monthly solar energy was minimal, with a range of only 61.3 Wh/m(2). The calculated electrical load was 7.454 kWh/d. The technoeconomic assessment showed that the return on investment was MYR 3600 per year. However, the value of the payback period varies according to the value of the cost of capital spent. Regarding the cost of capital of this study, the shortest and longest payback periods achievable were 2.78 and 13.89 years, respectively. This calculation is in line with a photovoltaic system with a capacity of 2.2 kWp.","{""Abd Hamid, Ag Sufiyan"",""Abd Rahman, Abu Bakar"",""Ibrahim, Adnan"",""Jamain, Zuhair"",""Makmud, Mohamad Zul Hilmey""}","10.3390/su132212432",2024-09-30 17:20:28,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""photovoltaic system; solar potential; off-grid solar; tropical island; solar irradiation""}"
6863060,"The Use Of Multi-Temporal Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi) Data For Assessing Forest Cover Change Of Lawarchara National Park","Lawachara National Park (LNP) is one of the most renowned protected areas in Bangladesh and a natural habitat of critically endangered Hoolock gibbon. The study's purpose was to assess the long-term change of forest cover using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) technique and evaluate the impact of co-management. Landsat images acquired from the USGS glovis website were used to assess forest cover change using NDVI, a popular technique for identification and estimation of forest areas. NDVI value ranges from (− 1) to (+ 1); a negative value indicates non-vegetated areas including water bodies, road surfaces, settlements, etc., whereas a positive value near (+ 1) indicates the highest density vegetation. NDVI value (0) indicates bare land without vegetation. Based on NDVI values, the forest areas have been divided into four categories, namely: (1) very low or no vegetation area, (2) low-density vegetation area, (3) moderate-density vegetation area, and (4) dense vegetation area. A household survey was carried out among the people living in the adjacent villages to LNP. The study of assessing the forest cover change of LNP using remotely sensed data revealed that, after the initiation of co-management, the dense vegetation area increased by 8.62% in 2006 compared to 2001, but it decreased by 0.77% in 2014. In 2018, dense vegetation decreased by 3.86% relative to the dense vegetation area of 2014. If it is compared as a whole, it can be said that the forest cover has improved under co-management, and the household survey revealed that forest dependence has been reduced which might be considered as one of the reasons for forest cover improvement. However, more improvement can be achieved by focusing on the villages where forest dependence is still high. Betel leaf cultivation inside the forest area is creating a problem for wildlife and also hampering the natural composition of flora. Therefore, it is recommended to rehabilitate betel leaf cultivators outside the forest area with proper compensation. This will harness the full potentiality of the co-management practice, it needs complete monitoring and goodwill from every stakeholder, and hence it will bring good for the whole country. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","{""Alam, M.

6863559,"A Nonparametric Approach To Filling Gaps In Satellite-Retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth For Estimating Ambient Pm2.5 Levels","Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) is commonly used to estimate ambient levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), though it is important to mitigate the estimation bias of PM2.5 due to gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. A nonparametric approach with two random-forest submodels is proposed to estimate PM2.5 levels by filling gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. This novel approach was employed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 levels during 2013-2015 in the Sichuan Basin of Southwest China, where the coverage rate of composite AOD retrieved by the Terra and Aqua satellites was only 11.7\%. Based on the retrieved AOD and various covariates (including meteorological conditions and land use types), the first random-forest submodel (named AOD-submodel) was trained to fill the gaps in the AOD dataset, giving a cross-validation R-2 of 0.95. Subsequently, the second random-forest submodel (named PM2.5-submodel) was trained to estimate the PM2.5 levels for unmonitored areas/days based on the gap-filled AOD, ground-monitored PM2.5 levels, and the covariates, and achieved a cross-validation R-2 of 0.86. By comparing the complete and incomplete (i.e., without the days when AOD data were missing) estimates, we found that the monthly PM2.5 levels could be overestimated by 34.6\% if the PM2.5 values coincident with AOD gaps were not considered. The newly developed approach is valuable for deriving the complete spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 from incomplete remote sensing data, which is essential for air quality management and human exposure assessment.

6863156,"Monitoring Of Chlorophyll-A And Suspended Sediment Concentrations In Optically Complex Inland Rivers Using Multisource Remote Sensing Measurements","In recent decades, phytoplankton proliferation and sediment input to rivers (especially urban rivers) have become more dramatic under the compound pressure of climate change and human activities. Given the generally narrow width of rivers and current high spatial resolution satellites, which are limited by band settings, bandwidth, and the signal-to-noise ratio, UAVs with their exceptional spatiotemporal resolution can be used as a useful tool for river environmental monitoring and inversion uncertainty assessment. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral (X20P) and multispectral (P4M) images, along with Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat-9 OLI2 data, were used to assess the uncertainty in retrieving chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations in rivers. Chla and SS models based on UAV and satellite data were constructed using stepwise multiple regression and typical Chla and SS retrieval algorithms, respectively, and the performance of the models was the focus of our research. The results demonstrated that in the Chla concentration inversion, each sensor performed as follows: X20P > P4M > Landsat9 OLI2 > Sentinel-2 MSI > Landsat8 OLI, and the performance in the SS concentration inversion was as follows: X20P > Sentinel-2 MSI > P4M > Landsat9 OLI2 > Landsat8 OLI. In addition, the uncertainty of high spatial resolution satellite retrievals was analyzed with the assistance of the UAV-based model. Results showed that narrow bandwidths and finely tuned band settings are more essential for the Chla inversion. The typical Chla retrieval algorithm, NDCI, is only effective in certain bands (band 1 from 684 to 724 nm and band 2 from 660 to 680 nm). It is also noted that Landsat8 and Landsat9 lack some key band settings (e.g., the red-edge band of 700-710 nm), severely limiting practical application in relation to Chla. However, specific variances in different sensor bands have a relatively small impact on SS inversion, for example, the correlation between SS and the R/B (a typical SS retrieval algorithm) constructed by each sensor ranged from 0.68 to 0.77. Chla monitoring, on the other hand, necessitates a higher spatial resolution than SS monitoring. The accuracy decreased markedly when UAV images were resampled to 10 m and 30 m spatial resolution. However, it is not as crucial for the SS inversion, images with the original spatial resolution (RMSE<30cm = 6.28 mg/L) were resampled to 10 m resolution (RMSE10m = 5.85 mg/L) and 30 m resolution (RMSE30m = 4.08 mg/L) while using P4M for SS inversion, and the accuracy increased. Our results demonstrated and highlighted various options for future monitoring of Chla and SS, while exploiting the synergy between UAVs and satellites to achieve more precise observations at greater spatial and temporal scales, which will benefit aquatic environment management and protection.","{""Chen, Jiahao"",""Fu, Yongshuo H."",""Guo, Shihui"",""Guo, Yahui"",""Hao, Fanghua"",""Li, Xiran"",""Nie, Xingyu"",""Xiao, Yi"",""Xu, Yue""}","10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111041",2024-07-17 19:33:57,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{calibration,comparison}","{""High spatial resolution; Optical Satellite; Inland waters; Chlorophyll-a; Suspended sediment; Unmann""}"

Identification of erosion-prone areas is the most important factor for agricultural planning and effective land management. This study includes an estimation of average annual soil loss in the Sone command area in Bihar and the preparation of spatially distributed soil erosion map for different land-use scenarios. The soil in the study area is generally clay loam. A well-known empirical equation i.e. RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) has been used to estimate parameters and prepare spatially distributed maps. By using remote sensing and GIS techniques different soil loss parameters like rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness factor (LS), cover management factor (C) and conservation practice factor (P) are estimated and spatially distributed map of all these parameters are prepared. Average soil loss in the study area was found in the range 21 to 40 t.ha(-1).yr(-1) and the maximum value is found to be around 7000 t.ha(-1).yr(-1). It was also found that areas with high soil erosion rates are very low. Around 46\% variation is observed between the maximum and minimum average soil loss rates.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimating the impact on a wide range of ecosystem services is important for decision making and the sustainable development of these regions. This study analyzed time-series Landsat data to determine the influences of oasis land-use changes on the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region in Northwest China. The following results were found. The total value of the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region were approximately \$10,845.3, \$11,218.6, \$10,291.7, and \$10,127.3 million in 1986, 1996, 2005, and 2015, respectively. The water supply, waste treatment, biodiversity protection, and recreation and cultural services were the four ecosystem services with the highest service value, contributing 77.05\% of the total ecosystem services. The combined contribution rate of food production and raw material value was only about 4.02\%, relatively small. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated total ecosystem service value (ESV) for this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. The findings of this study will be crucial for maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the oasis region, where socio-economic development and the integrity of the natural ecosystem complement each other.

6862863,"Passive Monitoring Of Mental Health Status In The Criminal Forensic Population","Current approaches to monitoring patients’ mental status rely heavily on self-reported symptomatology, clinician observation, and self-rated symptom scales. The limitations inherent in these methodologies have implications for the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. Certain populations are particularly affected by these limitations because of their unique situations, including criminal forensic patients, who have a history of both criminal behavior and mental disorder, and experience increased stigma and restrictions in their access to mental health care. This population may benefit particularly from recent developments in technology and the growing use of mobile devices and sensors to collect behavioral information via passive monitoring. These technologies offer objective parameters that correlate with mental health status and create an opportunity to use Big Data and machine learning to refine diagnosis and predict behavior in a way that represents a marked shift from current practices. This article reviews the approaches to and limitations of psychiatric assessment and contrasts this with the promise of these new technologies. It then discusses the ethics concerns associated with these technologies and explores their potential relevance to criminal forensic psychiatry and the broader implications they carry for health and criminal justice policy. © 2019, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.

6863461,"The Responses Of Ecosystem Services To Land-Use Change In Dianshan Lake Area From 1984 To 2014","Water resources are an important guarantee for the development of regions and eities. Understanding the ehanges in ecosystem services and their driving forces, therefore, is of great significance in the management of water resources across regions. By utilizing remote sensing images of Dianshan Like area in 1984, 1993, 2(X)6 and 2014, land-use change and ecosystem service value ( ESV) were analyzed by revising the ESV coefficient of different types of land use. The results showed that the areas of woodland and construction land tended to increase, while those of arable land and water bodies tended to decrease between 1984 and 2014. Results from the ESV analysis showed that the ESV of water bodies and arable land decreased by 215 and 24! million yuan, respectively, while the ESV of woodland increased by 250 million yuan. The ESV sensitivity index of each land-use type was less than 1 , indicating that the ESV of the study area was inelastic. On the township scale, the ESV analysis showed a net increase only in Zhujiajiao and Jinxi Towns. At the provincial and municipal scales, the total ESV perunitarea of Jiangsu Province decreased, while the total ESV per unit area of Shanghai increased. The driving force analysis showed that both natural and socio-economic factors had an impact on the ESV. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between population density and ESV and between total regional economic output and ESV. Our results suggest that changes in land use have an important impart on the ESV. An optimal land-use pattern would help to increase the total ESV across regions. © 2019 Science Press.

6863565,"Impact Of The Transport Of Aerosols From The Free Troposphere Towards The Boundary Layer On The Air Quality In The Paris Area","We propose a quantification of the downward transport of aerosols from the free troposphere (FT) to the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Aerosols are originally released at the surface as a consequence of anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, soil mobilization, etc. After being vertically transported into the FT, they are exposed to the long-range transport (LRT) and may subside to impact, in turn, surface air pollution in remote places. Using 5400 h of routine Lidar observations conducted at the SIRTA observatory in the Paris area (France), we identified 154 free tropospheric aerosol layers continuously monitored during their downward transport into the local PBL. One of these events-associated to a Saharan dust outbreak-is thoroughly documented in a case study. And a climatological analysis of surface PM10 levels recorded at air quality monitoring stations allows the impact of FT to PBL transport of aerosols to be quantified. This source is found to be significant for 15 out of the 16 stations, with average PM10 concentrations 2.14 μg m-3 (i.e. 12%) above climatological values after the injection of free tropospheric aerosols into the PBL. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

6863622,"Considerations On Capacity Building For National Forest Assessments In Developing Countries - With A Case Study Of India","Large-area forest assessments are attracting increasing attention owing to their role in providing information related to carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation and enhancement of rural livelihoods. The information needs actually hold good for all geographic levels from the local to the global. Forest assessments on national level are of particular interest because countries that wish to engage in the REDD+ initiative and to benefit from results-based payments, need to give quantitative evidence of their progresses in enhancing their forest resources. This contribution analyzes the capacity building needs for national forest assessments with a focus on the situation in developing countries, identifies key areas in which national capacity may be developed and makes suggestions for implementation. India's forest assessment systems are used as an example. The National Forest Inventory (NFI) system needs to be institutionalized to ensure a practical way for proficient monitoring and analysis of forest ecosystems. The institutions established to carry out NFI require continued institutional and financial support with qualified and committed scholars and professionals from relevant disciplines, including forest mensuration, forest inventory and remote sensing. © 2015, BioOne.

6863275,"Toward Cloud-Native, Machine Learning Base Detection Of Crop Disease With Imaging Spectroscopy","Developing actionable early detection and warning systems for agricultural stakeholders is crucial to reduce the annual \$200B USD losses and environmental impacts associated with crop diseases. Agricultural stakeholders primarily rely on labor-intensive, expensive scouting and molecular testing to detect disease. Spectroscopic imagery (SI) can improve plant disease management by offering decision-makers accurate risk maps derived from Machine Learning (ML) models. However, training and deploying ML requires significant computation and storage capabilities. This challenge will become even greater as global-scale data from the forthcoming Surface Biology \& Geology satellite becomes available. This work presents a cloud-hosted architecture to streamline plant disease detection with SI from NASA's AVIRIS-NG platform, using grapevine leafroll-associated virus complex 3 (GLRaV-3) as a model system. Here, we showcase a pipeline for processing SI to produce plant disease detection models and demonstrate that the underlying principles of a cloud-based disease detection system easily accommodate model improvements and shifting data modalities. Our goal is to make the insights derived from SI available to agricultural stakeholders via a platform designed with their needs and values in mind. The key outcome of this work is an innovative, responsive system foundation that can empower agricultural stakeholders to make data-driven plant disease management decisions while serving as a framework for others pursuing use-inspired application development for agriculture to follow that ensures social impact and reproducibility while preserving stakeholder privacy.","{""Galvan, Fernando Romero"",""Gold, Kaitlin M."",""Pavlick, Ryan"",""Rubambiza, Gloire"",""Weatherspoon, Hakim""}","10.1029/2022jg007342",2024-07-19 18:34:30,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{""cool tool"",algorithm/process}","{""cloud-based disease detection; decision support; plant pathogens; imaging spectroscopic; machine lea""}"
6691537,"California’s COVID-19 economic shutdown reveals the fingerprint of systemic environmental racism","Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States often experience higher-than-average exposures to air pollution. However, the relative contribution of embedded institutional biases to these disparities can be difficult to disentangle from physical environmental drivers, socioeconomic status, and cultural or other factors that are correlated with exposures under status quo conditions. Over the spring and summer of 2020, rapid and sweeping COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders around the world created large perturbations to local and regional economic activity that resulted in observable changes in air pollution concentrations, compositions, and distributions. Here, we use the pandemic-related emergency order and subsequent economic slowdown to causally estimate pollution exposure disparities in California. Using both public ground-based sensor data and a citizen-science network of monitors for respirable particulate matter (PM2.5), along with satellite records of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), we show that the initial sheltering-in-place period produced disproportionate air pollution reduction benefits for Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and low- income communities. By linking these pollution data with weather, geographic, socioeconomic, and mobility data in difference-in-differences models, we demonstrate that these disparate pollution reductions cannot be explained by environmental conditions, geography, income, or local economic activity and are instead driven by non-local activity. This study thus provides causally-identified evidence of systemic racial and ethnic bias in pollution control under business-as-usual conditions.","{""Blum, Richard""}","https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/e86mh",2024-04-27 21:00:58,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}",NA

The Assembly, though, became a sign of hope beyond the ecumenical crisis. Its reflections and proposals on Globalisation and economic injustice, on Christian identity and religious plurality and on Church Unity and the Mission of the Church demonstrate a matured ecumenical and ecclesiological awareness, strengthened by a new method of decision-making by consensus. The document Called to be the one Church might be seen as the constitutional basis for a reconfiguration of the ecumenical movement and as a refinement of the Toronto Declaration of 1950.

6863452,"Analysis Of Land Cover Change Detection In Gozamin District, Ethiopia: From Remote Sensing And Dpsir Perspectives","Land cover patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly changing. This study aims to quantify the land cover change and to identify its major determinants by using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses (DPSIR) framework in the Ethiopian Gozamin District over a period of 32 years (1986 to 2018). Satellite images of Landsat 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2003), and Sentinel-2 (2018) and a supervised image classification methodology were used to assess the dynamics of land cover change. Land cover maps of the three dates, focus group discussions (FGDs), interviews, and farmers' lived experiences through a household survey were applied to identify the factors for changes based on the DPSIR framework. Results of the investigations revealed that during the last three decades the study area has undergone an extensive land cover change, primarily a shift from cropland and grassland into forests and built-up areas. Thus, quantitative land cover change detection between 1986 and 2018 revealed that cropland, grassland, and bare areas declined by 10.53\%, 5.7\%, and 2.49\%. Forest, built-up, shrub/scattered vegetation, and water bodies expanded by 13.47\%, 4.02\%, 0.98\%, and 0.25\%. Household surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) identified the population growth, the rural land tenure system, the overuse of land, the climate change, and the scarcity of grazing land as drivers of these land cover changes. Major impacts were rural to urban migration, population size change, scarcity of land, and decline in land productivity. The outputs from this study could be used to assure sustainability in resource utilization, proper land use planning, and proper decision-making by the concerned government authorities.","{""Agegnehu, Sayeh Kassaw"",""Atzberger, Clement"",""Bauer, Thomas"",""Gedefaw, Abebaw Andarge"",""Mansberger, Reinfried""}","10.3390/su12114534",2024-07-18 21:06:49,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""land cover change; remote sensing; image analysis; supervised classification; maximum likelihood; DP""}"
6863278,"Managing Marine Protected Areas In Remote Areas: The Case Of The Subantarctic Heard And Mcdonald Islands","Large marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established to contribute to global conservation targets but present an immense challenge for managers as they seek to govern human interactions with the environment over a vast geographical expanse. These challenges are further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the absence of critical management functions such as environmental monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In 2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area, Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for future research.","{""Ban, Natalie C."",""Brooks, Cassandra M."",""Epstein, Graham""}","10.3389/fmars.2019.00631",2024-07-13 00:14:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""conservation; common pool resources; marine protected areas; toothfish; subanterctic; Southern Ocean""}"

6862951,"Modeling The Spatio-Temporal Changes In Land Uses And Its Impacts On Ecosystem Services In Northeast China Over 2000-2050","Land use and its dynamics have attracted considerable scientific attention for their significant ecological and socioeconomic implications. Many studies have investigated the past changes in land use, but efforts exploring the potential changes in land use and implications under future scenarios are still lacking. Here we simulate the future land use changes and their impacts on ecosystem services in Northeast China (NEC) over the period of 2000-2050 using the CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) model under the scenarios of ecological security (ESS), food security (FSS) and comprehensive development (CDS). The model was validated against remote sensing data in 2005. Overall, the accuracy of the CLUE-S model was evaluated at 82.5\%. Obtained results show that future cropland changes mainly occur in the Songnen Plain and the Liaohe Plain, forest and grassland changes are concentrated in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains and the western Changbai Mountains, while the Sanjiang Plain will witness major changes of the wetlands. Our results also show that even though CDS is defined based on the goals of the regional development plan, the ecological service value (ESV) under CDS is RMB 2656.18 billion in 2050. The ESV of CDS is lower compared with the other scenarios. Thus, CDS is not an optimum scenario for eco-environmental protection, especially for the wetlands, which should be given higher priority for future development. The issue of coordination is also critical in future development. The results can help to assist structural adjustments for agriculture and to guide policy interventions in NEC.","{""Tan Wenxia"",""Verburg, Peter H."",""Wu Wenbin"",""Xia Tian"",""Yang Peng"",""Ye Liming"",""Zhou Qingbo""}","10.1007/s11442-018-1532-7",2024-07-19 20:56:28,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Northeast China; land use; spatio-temporal change; scenario; ecosystem service""}"
6863093,"Comparisons Of Random Forest And Stochastic Gradient Treeboost Algorithms For Mapping Soil Electrical Conductivity With Multiple Subsets Using Landsat Oli And Dem/Gis-Based Data At A Type Oasis In Xinjiang, China","Accurate assessment of the spatial distribution and severity of soil salinization has long plagued local governments and researchers in the arid parts of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XJUAR). The emergence of machine learning has brought hope to this research field, such as Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT),however, which are few applications to the quantitative assessment of soil salinization. Therefore, in order to evaluate the accuracy level of the two algorithms for predicting soil salinity, twenty-seven environmental subsets were designed. Each data set is calculated using both RF and SGT to produce an optimal set of variables. The simulation results from 70.37% (19/27) of the subsets showed that the predicted value of soil salinity from SGT is closer to the observed value than is that from RF. The statistics of all datasets showed that the average values of R2 value for RF and SGT were 0.38 and 0.40, the average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value were 28.59 and 27.46, and the Ratio of Prediction to Deviation (RPD) averages were 1.20 and 1.24, respectively. The important dominant factor were topographic variables with coarse resolution, temperature and vegetation indices, land use and landform. . © 2021 The Author(s).

6862913,"Uniting Remote Sensing, Crop Modelling And Economics For Agricultural Risk Management","The increasing availability of satellite data at higher spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions is enabling new applications in agriculture and economic development, including agricultural insurance. Yet, effectively using satellite data in this context requires blending technical knowledge about their capabilities and limitations with an understanding of their influence on the value of risk-reduction programmes. In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task. Audits to account for inevitable misestimation complement efforts to detect and protect against large losses. Improvements in earth observation are enabling new approaches to assess agricultural losses, such as those resulting from adverse weather. This Review examines advances in the application of remotely sensed data and crop modelling in index-based insurance as well as opportunities to enhance the quality of index insurance programmes. Key pointsIn many developing regions, adverse weather can lead to food insecurity, reduced investments or distressed asset sales that ensnare people in a cycle of poverty.Tools to manage risk - such as well-designed insurance - can help people avoid the most severe possible consequences of bad weather and build confidence to invest in additional income-generating opportunities.In recent decades, governments and researchers across the globe have trialled approaches to inexpensively assess agricultural losses. Index-based insurance offers promise, but detecting losses cheaply and accurately remains challenging.Recent advances in crop modelling and remote sensing can improve index-based approaches by strengthening the link between indices and actual losses, as well as reducing programme costs.We provide an economic framework to evaluate indices, suggesting how the remote sensing and modelling communities can contribute to enhancing index insurance quality through better detection of adverse conditions.Promising opportunities to enhance index insurance programmes include inexpensively addressing heterogeneous conditions on the ground, such as employing audits, optimizing insurance zones, using new sensors or increasing contract flexibility.","{""Benami, Elinor"",""Carter, Michael R."",""Ghosh, Aniruddha"",""Hijmans, Robert J."",""Hobbs, Andrew"",""Jin, Zhenong"",""Kenduiywo, Benson"",""Lobell, David B.""}","10.1038/s43017-020-00122-y",2024-07-17 16:58:21,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",2021,"{interesting,""check it out""}",NA
6862773,"Evaluating China's Biomass Power Production Investment Based On A Policy Benefit Real Options Model","In this study, a policy benefit real options model was developed to evaluate biomass power production investment in China. A method based on the cumulative probability was proposed using binomial decision tree calculations for the exercising of options in order to evaluate the optimal investment timing. Two scenarios were analyzed to identify the optimal investment strategy with/without the consideration of revenue from certified emission reduction (CER). Uncertainties in straw purchased price, government incentives, and technological improvements were considered. The results showed that it was not optimal for immediate investment in biomass power production in China. Given full government subsidy, the thresholds of straw purchased price for scenarios 1 and 2 are 213.55 and 218.87 RMB/ton, respectively, while the current straw purchased price in Chinese market is 220 RMB/ton. The investment of biomass power production would be executed at 2022 and 2028 with/without the consideration of revenue from CER in the current situation in China if there are no government incentive to encourage motivation, respectively. The conclusion could provide useful information for power enterprise decision-makers on whether and when to invest a biomass power production in China in an uncertain environment.

Geospatial technology can quickly, effectively, and quantitatively to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of eco-environmental quality (EEQ). The present study is focused on novel approach of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index (RSEI), using Landsat Imagery data to assess environmental conditions and changes pattern. Four ecological indicators were prepared in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 of Kolkata urban agglomeration (KUA) to evaluate the ecological environmental condition. The principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial autocorrelation analysis can relate all indicators with each other's and RSEI. Out study indicated, greenness and wetness have a positive effect on EEQ of the province, but both dryness and heat have a negative effect. However, it should be noted that greenness has a greater impact on the eco-environment than the other three indicators. Based on the RSEI values, we have categorized the environmental standards of the study area into four groups-very good (0.81-1.00), good (0.61-0.80), acceptable (0.41-0.60), poor (0.21-0.40), and very poor (0.00-0.20), where high values indicate that environmental quality is stable and healthy for living organisms and low values indicate relatively unstable and threatening conditions of the environment. The status of RSEI showed that 9.02\%, 12.29\%, 12.79\% and 37.23\% of an area was under poor to very poor condition in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Good to very good condition of RSEI values was increased from 19.12\% to 34.074\% during 1990 to 2010, but declined of RSEI value 9.47\% during 2010 to 2020 due to urban expansion. Here, Moran's I values fund that 0.265, 0.543, 0.396 and 0.367 in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. The result of Moran's I values indicate that clustering nature.

6863203,"Hydrological Simulation Using Trmm And Chirps Precipitation Estimates In The Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin","Satellite-based products with high spatial and temporal resolution provide useful precipitation information for data-sparse or ungauged large-scale watersheds. In the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, rainfall stations are sparse and unevenly distributed, and the transboundary characteristic makes the collection of precipitation data more difficult, which has restricted hydrological processes simulation. In this study, daily precipitation data from four datasets (gauge observations, inverse distance weighted (IDW) data, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimates, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) estimates), were applied to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and then their capability for hydrological simulation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin were examined. TRMM and CHIRPS data showed good performances on precipitation estimation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, with the better performance for TRMM product. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of gauge, IDW, TRMM, and CHIRPS simulations during the calibration period were 0.87, 0.86, 0.95, and 0.93 for monthly flow, respectively, and those for daily flow were 0.75, 0.77, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively. TRMM and CHIRPS data were superior to rain gauge and IDW data for driving the hydrological model, and TRMM data produced the best simulation performance. Satellite-based precipitation estimates could be suitable data sources when simulating hydrological processes for large data-poor or ungauged watersheds, especially in international river basins for which precipitation observations are difficult to collect. CHIRPS data provide long precipitation time series from 1981 to near present and thus could be used as an alternative precipitation input for hydrological simulation, especially for the period without TRMM data. For satellite-based precipitation products, the differences in the occurrence frequencies and amounts of precipitation with different intensities would affect simulation results of water balance components, which should be comprehensively considered in water resources estimation and planning.","{""He, Daming"",""Ji, Xuan"",""Li, Yungang"",""Luo, Xian"",""Wu, Wenqi""}","10.1007/s11769-019-1014-6",2024-09-30 21:21:19,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""hydrological simulation; satellite-based precipitation estimates; spatial distribution of precipitat""}"
6691705,"Economic value of hurricane forecasts: an overview and research needs","Hurricane forecasting is in part an economic problem, because it commits scarce resources to save lives, reduce injuries, and lessen economic impacts. New sensing, recording, and reporting technologies, as well as the increased number of clients and their changing needs, have heightened the need to economically justify the hurricane warning system. Estimating forecast value can help show if improved forecast provision and dissemination would offer more benefit to society than alternative public investments such as infrastructure or forecasts of other hazards. We review research that has estimated the economic value of the hurricane forecast and warning system and the value of improving forecast quality. We recommend developing a comprehensive theoretical understanding of economic value of hurricane forecasts to diverse stakeholders across all time scales. This improved, basic understanding would involve a more in-depth discussion of the value of information as well as a broader knowledge of actual or created distinctions between adaptation, mitigation, and response to hurricane risks.","{""Letson, David""}","https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2007)8:3(78)",2024-04-26 18:56:08,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2007,"{}","{""Risk management|Weather forecasting|Economic models|Hurricanes|Public safety""}"
6863356,"Combined Impacts Of Land Use And Soil Property Changes On Soil Erosion In A Mollisol Area Under Long-Term Agricultural Development","Soil erosion exhibits special characteristics in the process of agricultural development. Understanding the combined impacts of land use and soil property changes on soil erosion, especially in the area under long-term agricultural cultivations, is vital to watershed agricultural and soil management. This study investigated the temporal-spatial patterns of the soil erosion based on a modified version of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and conducted a soil erosion contribution analysis. The land use data were interpreted from Landsat series images, and soil properties were obtained from field sampling, laboratory tests and SPAW (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Water) model calculations. Over a long period of agricultural development, the average erosion modulus decreased from 187.7 t km− 2 a− 1 in 1979 to 158.4 t km− 2 a− 1 in 2014. The land use types were transformed mainly in the reclamation of paddy fields and the shrinking of wetlands on a large scale. Most of the soils were converted to loam from silty or clay loam and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of most soil types decreased by 1.11% to 43.6%. The rapidly increasing area of 49.8 km2 of paddy fields together with the moderate decrease of 14.0 km2 of forests, as well as Ks values explained 87.4% of the total variance in soil erosion. Although changes in soil physical and water characteristics indicated that soil erosion loads should have become higher, the upsurge in paddy fields played an important role in mitigating soil erosion in this study area. These results demonstrated that land use changes had more significant impacts than soil property changes on soil erosion. This study suggested that rational measures should be taken to extend paddy fields and control the dry land farming. These findings will benefit watershed agricultural targeting and management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","{""Bu, Q."",""Gao, X."",""Hao, Z."",""Ouyang, W."",""Wu, Y."",""Zhang, Q.""}","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.173",2024-07-19 18:35:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Agricultural cultivation"",""Agricultural development"",""Agricultural management"",Agronomy,Article,China,Cultivation,Erosion,""Hydraulic conductivity"",""Land use"",Landsat,Mollisol,""Mollisol area"",Mollisols,""Paddy fields"",""Sediment transport"",""Soil conservation"",""Soil erosion"",""Soil properties"",""Soil property"",""Soil property changes"",""Soil testing"",Soils,""Synergistic effect"",""Synergistic effects"",""Universal Soil Loss Equation"",Watersheds,agriculture,""bulk density"",""environmental impact"",forest,""land use change"",""loam soil"",""paddy field"",""priority journal"",rain,""soil organic matter"",""soil texture"",synergism,""temporal analysis"",wetland}"
6863024,"Integration Of Alos Palsar And Landsat Data For Land Cover And Forest Mapping In Northern Tanzania","Land cover and forest mapping supports decision makers in the course of making informed decisions for implementation of sustainable conservation and management plans of the forest resources and environmental monitoring. This research examines the value of integrating of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat data for improved forest and land cover mapping in Northern Tanzania. A separate and joint processing of surface reflectance, backscattering and derivatives (i.e., Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Radar Forest Deforestation Index (RFDI), quotient bands, polarimetric features and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures) were executed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classification accuracy was assessed using a confusion matrix, where Overall classification Accuracy (OA), Kappa Coefficient (KC), Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA) and F-1 score index were computed. A two sample t-statistics was utilized to evaluate the influence of different data categories on the classification accuracy. Landsat surface reflectance and derivatives show an overall classification accuracy (OA = 86\%). ALOS PALSAR backscattering could not differentiate the land cover classes efficiently (OA = 59\%). However, combination of backscattering, and derivatives could differentiate the land cover classes properly (OA = 71\%). The attained results suggest that integration of backscattering and derivative has potential of utilization for mapping of land cover in tropical environment. Integration of backscattering, surface reflectance and their derivative increase the accuracy (OA = 97\%). Therefore it can be concluded that integration of ALOS PALSAR and optical data improve the accuracies of land cover and forest mapping and hence suitable for environmental monitoring.","{""Deus, Dorothea""}","10.3390/land5040043",2024-07-17 19:12:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2016,"{calibration}","{""integration; Landsat; ALOS PALSAR; support vector machine; land cover classification; forest""}"

The present study was carried out to understand the vegetation composition and structure in Doda area of Western Himalayas, India. During the study, vegetation types were mapped using on-screen image interpretation technique of multispectral high resolution satellite data. A total of ten types of vegetation were delineated from the satellite data. Phytosociological data was collected for the forest, pasture and scrub classes using nested-quadrat approach to characterize the vegetation. A total of ten phytosociological parameters were analyzed. Pinaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae were the dominant plant families with most of the identified plant species having a very high medicinal value. Other important component of the study involved landscape modelling, using the Spatial Landscape Analysis Model for identifying disturbance regimes and biodiversity rich landscapes in the area. The model results indicate that most of the area contains a very rich biodiversity repository with only a few areas showing signs of disturbance where terrain is either complex or where the anthropogenic pressures on forest resources are apparent. The forest and nature conservation managers could use the conservation measures suggested on the basis of these research findings for developing biodiversity conservation strategies in the region.","{""Rashid, Irfan"",""Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad"",""Vijayalakshmi, Tartiparti""}","10.1007/s10531-013-0538-9",2024-07-17 17:02:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{}","{""Remote sensing; Geospatial analysis; Vegetation; Phytosociology; Biodiversity""}"

6862916,"Clinical Research In Telemedicine: Evaluation Of The Medical Service To Patients","Telemedicine is a remote medical practice which uses tools related to information and communication technologies (ICT). Since July 21, 2009, French law permits this new medical practice and the decree of October 19, 2010, indicates the main procedures (tele-consultation, tele-expertise, medical tele-surveillance, medical tele-assistance, tele-advice from the hospital call center) and the conditions of their implementation. Clinical research is the practice of clinical trials which have the aim of evaluating the safety and efficacy of a diagnostic method or a new treatment. Clinical research is the main purpose of the National Association of Telemedicine (ANTEL) and of its new official journal European Research in Telemedicine. This editorial is opening the first issue of our journal. Several examples can illustrate the importance of clinical research in telemedicine. In type 1 diabetes, after the first discordant results due to insufficient or weak methodologies, the French study TeleDiab 1 brought for the first time a clinical improvement over 6 months in patients followed-up remotely by Diabeo software and teleconsultation. The main medical service to patients was a decrease of complication risks due to a significant decrease of HbA1c. Nevertheless, the encouraging results of this pilot study need confirmation over a longer period (the TELESAGE study over two years). In chronic heart failure, the first results of two meta-analyses showed a significant 30% reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, these results were not confirmed by two, more recent, prospective and randomised studies. Most authors think that it is necessary to define several subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure in order to recognize patient subgroups who could benefit from telemedicine at home. The medical service to stroke patients brought by telemedicine is not open to debate. Telestroke allows patients away from neurology centres to benefit from emergency thrombolysis (less than 4 h 30 min after the first signs) treatment that can allow the total or partial regression of a neurological deficit. Other telemedicine applications have been able to demonstrate a medical service to patients, for example remote blood pressure self-monitoring at home in hypertensive patients, live interactive teledermatology, teledialysis by peritoneal dialysis at home or by haemodialysis by a remote satellite unit, etc. Teleradiology brings a medical service to patients if it is carried out according to international or national guidelines. Many other applications of telemedicine may be the subject of clinical research such as telegeriatry, tele-psychiatry, tele-surgery, tele-rhumatology, tele-obstetric, tele-pathology, etc.). Telemedicine practice can have a significant economical impact, particularly due to reductions in hospitalisation numbers. Risk factors due to telemedicine are beginning to be known. Clinical research on the medical service to patients followed-up by telemedicine can prevent risks. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.","{""Simon, P.""}","10.1016/j.eurtel.2012.02.005",2024-10-03 21:52:49,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2012,"{}","{Applications,""Clinical research"",""Medical service to patients"",Risk,Telemedicine,""blood clot lysis"",""blood pressure monitoring"",""computer program"",""diagnostic procedure"",""emergency care"",""follow up"",""health care policy"",""heart failure"",hemodialysis,""hemoglobin A1c"",""home care"",human,hypertension,""insulin dependent diabetes mellitus"",""medical practice"",""medical service"",morbidity,mortality,""peritoneal dialysis"",""practice guideline"",review,""risk factor"",stroke,teleconsultation,teledermatology,teledialysis,telegeriatry,teleobstetric,telepathology,telepsychiatry,telerheumatology,telesurgery}"
6903493,"Adjoint Inverse Modeling Of NoX Emissions Over Eastern China Using Satellite Observations Of No2 Vertical Column Densities","A four-dimensional variational data assimilation system for optimization of NOx emissions (RC4-NOx) was developed. A parameterized NOx chemistry scheme was introduced into the RC4-NOx system, and key parameters such as chemical production and loss terms of NOx were calculated in advance using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. RC4-NOx was applied to optimize NOx emissions over eastern China (EC) in July 1996,1999, and 2002 using Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite observations of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and a priori emissions from the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS). After assimilation, RC4-NOx generally reproduced the spatial distribution, regional averaged values, and time evolution of GOME NO2 VCDs. Over EC, a priori emissions were reduced by 20\% in 1996 and by 8\% in 1999, whereas a posteriori emissions were almost the same as a priori emissions in 2002. A priori emissions in the Beijing region were reduced by optimization over the whole simulation period. A posteriori emissions over the Yangtze Delta were larger than a priori emissions in 2002, although they were smaller in both 1996 and 1999. As in other areas, a priori emissions over the North China Plain were reduced in 1996; but those over the eastern part of the plain were increased in 1999, and the area of increased emissions moved slightly westward in 2002. In each region, the growth rates of a posteriori emissions during both 1996-1999 and 1999-2002 became generally larger than those of a priori emissions, and the trends of a posteriori emissions became similar to those of GOME NO2 VCDs. Our inverse modeling analysis indicates that the rate of increase of NO, emissions over EC from 1996 to 2002 was much larger for a posteriori emissions (49\%) than for a priori emissions (19\%).

In particular, the application of WSN technology to the agricultural area, which is labor-intensive compared to other industries, and in addition is typically lacking in IT technology applications, adds value and can increase the agricultural productivity. This study attempts to establish a ubiquitous agricultural environment and improve the productivity of farms that grow paprika by suggesting a 'Ubiquitous Paprika Greenhouse Management System' using WSN technology. The proposed system can collect and monitor information related to the growth environment of crops outside and inside paprika greenhouses by installing WSN sensors and monitoring images captured by CCTV cameras. In addition, the system provides a paprika greenhouse environment control facility for manual and automatic control from a distance, improves the convenience and productivity of users, and facilitates an optimized environment to grow paprika based on the growth environment data acquired by operating the system. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","{""Hwang, J."",""Shin, C."",""Yoe, H.""}","10.3390/s101211566",2024-07-17 19:11:44,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2010,"{}","{""Accident prevention"",""Agricultural areas"",""Agricultural environments"",""Agricultural productivity"",Agriculture,Algorithms,Automation,Capsicum,""Computer Communication Networks"",Control,Control,""Crops, Agricultural"",""Environment, Controlled"",""Equipment Design"",""Facility Regulation"",Greenhouse,""Greenhouse environment"",""Greenhouse management"",Greenhouses,""Growth management"",Humans,Management,""Models, Biological"",Paprika,Productivity,""Remote Sensing Technology"",Technology,Ubiquitous,""Wireless Technology"",""Wireless sensor networks"",aging,algorithm,article,""biological model"",""computer network"",crop,""growth, development"",human,instrumentation,methodology,microclimate,pepper,""remote sensing"",""social control"",""wireless communication""}"
6863223,"Node-Based Optimization Of Gnss Tomography With A Minimum Bounding Box Algorithm","Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) tomography plays an important role in the monitoring and tracking of the tropospheric water vapor. In this study, a new approach for improving the node-based GNSS tomography is proposed, which makes a trade-off between the real observed region and the complexity of the discretization of the tomographic region. To obtain dynamically the approximate observed region, the convex hull algorithm and minimum bounding box algorithm are used at each tomographic epoch. This new approach can dynamically define the tomographic model for all types of study areas based on the GNSS data. The performance of the new approach is tested by comparing it against the common node-based GNSS tomographic approach. Test data in May 2015 are obtained from the Hong Kong GNSS network to build the tomographic models and the radiosonde data as a reference are used for validating the quality of the new approach. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square errors of the new approach, in most cases, have a 38 percent improvement and the values of standard deviation reduce to over 43 percent compared with the common approach. The results indicate that the new approach is applicable to the node-based GNSS tomography. © 2020 by the authors.","{""Ding, N."",""Holden, L."",""Liu, X."",""Wang, X."",""Wang, Y."",""Wu, S."",""Yan, X."",""Zhang, K."",""Zhang, S."",""Zhang, W."",""Zhang, Y.""}","10.3390/rs12172744",2024-10-03 17:29:30,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2020,"{}","{""Bounding box algorithm"",""Convex hull algorithm"",Discretizations,Economic,GNSS,""Global Navigation Satellite Systems"",""Global positioning system"",""Mean square error"",""Minimum bounding box"",Monitoring,""Radiosonde datas"",""Root mean square errors"",""Standard deviation"",""Tomographic technique"",Tomography,""Water vapor"",""social effects"",tracking}"
6863004,"Remotely Sensed Forest Structural Complexity Predicts Multi Species Occurrence At The Landscape Scale","Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5\% to 63.1\% and 0.77\% to 0.97\% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

6863432,"A Study On Avalanche-Triggering Factors And Activity Characteristics In Aerxiangou, West Tianshan Mountains, China","Through analyzing the triggering factors and activity characteristics of avalanches in Aerxiangou in the Western Tianshan Mountains, the formation and disaster-causing process of avalanches were studied to provide theoretical support and a scientific basis for avalanche disaster prevention. In this paper, based on remote sensing interpretation and field investigation, a spatial distribution map of avalanches was established, and the induced and triggering factors in disaster-prone environments were analyzed using the certainty factor model. The degree of influence (E) of the disaster-causing factors on avalanche triggering was quantified, and the main control conditions conducive to avalanche occurrence in different periods were obtained. The RAMMS-avalanche model was used to analyze the activity characteristics at points where multiple avalanches occurred. Research results: (1) The E values of the average temperature, average snowfall, and surface roughness in February were significantly higher than those of other hazard-causing factors, reaching 1.83 and 1.71, respectively, indicating strong control. The E values of the surface cutting degree, average temperature, and average snow depth in March were all higher than 1.8, indicating that these control factors were more prominent than the other factors. In contrast, there were four hazard-causing factors with E values higher than 1.5 in April: the mean temperature, slope, surface roughness, and mean wind speed, with clear control. (2) Under the influence of the different hazard-causing factors, the types of avalanches from February–April mainly included new full-layer avalanches, surface avalanches, and full-layer wet avalanches. (3) In the RAMMS-avalanche simulation test, considering the deposition effect, compared to the previous avalanche movement path, the secondary avalanche flow accumulation area impact range changes were slight, while the movement area within the avalanche path changes was large, as were the different categories of avalanches and their different movement characteristic values. Overall, wet snow avalanches are more hazardous, and the impact force is larger. The new snow avalanches start in a short period, the sliding rate is fast, and the avalanche sliding surface (full-snow surface and face-snow) of the difference is mainly manifested in the differences in the value of the flow height. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Hu, C."",""Liu, J."",""Sun, X."",""Wang, B."",""Yang, Z."",""Yao, S."",""Zhang, T.""}","10.3390/atmos14091439",2024-09-30 16:55:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""activity characteristics"",avalanche,""certainty factor model""}"
6863542,"Current Value Of Historical And Ongoing Surveillance For Disease Freedom: Surveillance For Bovine Johne's Disease In Western Australia","'Confidence' in freedom from disease is generally derived from multiple sources of varied surveillance information, and typically this surveillance evidence has been accumulated over time. In the state of Western Australia (WA) the main surveillance evidence supporting Free Zone status in the national bovine Johne's disease (BJD) program comprises periodic surveys and the ongoing clinical diagnostic system. This paper illustrates a simple approach to current valuation of historical surveillance information, based on the calculated sensitivity of the surveillance processes, the time elapsed since the data were accumulated, and the probability of new introduction of disease into the population during that elapsed time. Surveillance system components (SSCs) contributing to the overall sensitivity of the surveillance system were the clinical diagnostic system and periodic targeted surveys. Sensitivity of each component was estimated using a stochastic scenario tree model of the surveillance process as implemented. Probability of introduction of BJD into WA during each time period was estimated retrospectively from a stochastic import risk analysis model applied to actual cattle importation data. The probability that the WA cattle population was free from infection (at design prevalences of 0.2% of herds and 2% of animals within an infected herd) was estimated following each of 11 years, giving a median probability that the State was free of BJD (at these design prevalences) at the end of 2005 of 0.89.

6863353,"Parrotfish Soundscapes: Implications For Coral Reef Management","Parrotfishes are prominent members of the herbivore/detritivore feeding guild on coral reefs. Their feeding activity is important for the removal of algae and detritus, the clearing of new settlement sites for coral and other larvae, and the bioerosion and redistribution of sand across the reef. Estimates of parrotfish feeding activity are normally obtained by divers that may influence or overlook fish behaviors, and are of short duration, limited to shallow habitats, and have limited temporal resolution to associate feeding activity with ecological processes. Excavator and scraper parrotfishes have a robust beak-like jaw morphology that produces a unique sound as the teeth scrape the surface of hard coral rock. We tested the hypothesis that ambient parrotfish bite sounds can be used to estimate their temporal patterns of feeding and associations with environmental variates in the area of an acoustic recorder. Acoustic recorders were deployed on 2 Hawaiian reefs to collect ambient fish sounds for a period of 3 yr. Parrotfish bite sounds showed distinct and repetitive variations in daily, seasonal, and annual feeding patterns, and were statistically correlated with factors of day length and tide range. This study demonstrates the utility of using parrotfish bite sounds to estimate patterns of feeding at coral reef sites. We suggest that regular sampling by multiple acoustic monitors may be a cost-efficient and valuable tool for monitoring the health, degradation, and recovery of large coral reef areas. © Inter-Research 2021.","{""Boyle, K.

6863154,"Prediction Of Soil Organic Matter Based On Multi-Resolution Remote Sensing Data And Random Forest Algorithm","Soil organic matter is closely related with soil fertility, so the knowledge about spatial distribution of soil organic matter is conducive to rationalization of fertilization management and improvement of land use potential. As carbon source, soil organic carbon is an important factor affecting regional carbon budgeting. Remote sensing data has widely been used in digital soil mapping, which may improve accuracy of the prediction of soil properties to a certain extent. With the aeolian sandy fluvial land and loess hills in Yuyang District cited as subject, this study tried to predict soil organic content and distribution in the topsoil layer of the region of a varying resolution (30 m, 56 m and 250 m), using random forest (RF) algorithm and relevant thematic mapper (TM), advanced wide field sensor (AWIFS), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (M0DIS) and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) data, separately, and in addition, other various factors affecting distribution of soil organic matter, and to validate the predictions with soil samples collected from 324 sampling sites. Variables in the prediction were screened in the light of out-of-bag (OOB) errors the RF algorithm may yield. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the differences between predicted and observed values of soil organic matter relative to resolution. Entropies of the prediction, using the RF model, of distribution of soil organic matter in regions different in topography were compared. Besides, explanation of spatial variability of soil organic matter with the RF model was compared relative to resolution, and at the same time, various environmental variables in the aeolian sandy fluvial land area and loess hilly area were ranked in importance relative to resolution of the TM, AWIFS and MODIS data used, so as to identify the most important environmental variables affecting distribution of soil organic matter; and based on the partial dependence map of soil organic matter on the variables, specific range of the impacts of the main variables were delineated. Results showed that:1) in the aeolian sand fluvial land area, the prediction using the RF model and the AWIFS data is the highest in accuracy, with OOB error being 3.52 and correlation coefficient between predicted and measured values reaching 0.67, regardless of percentage of the samples taken for validation, while in the loess hilly area, the prediction based on the TM data is the highest, with OOB error being is 3.31 and correlation coefficient reaching 0.71. The prediction is better in the loess hilly area than in the aeolian sand fluvial land area, with MAE being in the range of 1.27 ∼ 1.57 g kg-1 in the former and in the range of 1.46 ∼ 2.08 g kg-1 in the latter. 2) ln the aeolian sand fluvial land area, vegetation is the most important factor affecting distribution of soil organic matter, and mostly in positive relationship with soil organic matter. Among the TM data, reduced simple ratio (RSR) is the highest in effect on soil organic matter, or > 7.5 g kg-1, among the AWIFS data, normalized difference vegetation green index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) are, or > 8.5 g kg-1, and among the MODIS data, NDVI is or > 8 g kg-1. Elevation is the second one and its impact varies the most sharply when it ranges between 1 200 and 1 260 m and peaks at 1 220 m. Distance from water source is the third one. As water sources in the aeolian sandy fluvial land area are quite scattered and small in area, their impacts on soil organic matter seldom exceed 500 m. 3) ln the loess hilly area, elevation is the most important factor affecting soil organic matter and negatively related to soil organic matter. Geographic location is the second one, soil organic matter declines in content from southwest to northeast in the area. Vegetation is the third one, in positive relationship with soil organic matter, but in all t e three types of datasets, the impacts of vegetation indices on soil organic matter never go beyond 8 g kg-1. So, it is quite obvious that in areas relatively simple in topography, it is advisable to use data relatively low in resolution instead of data high in resolution in predicting soil organic matter and the RF model is more effective in predicting in areas complex in topography.

6663358,"The Emerging Role Of Remote Sensing Technology In Emergency Management","The use of remote sensing technology is becoming increasingly widespread at all levels of the disaster management cycle. This paper reviews a number of emerging application areas, drawing on examples from both natural disasters such as earthquakes, and man-made events including recent terrorist attacks. In terms of mitigation and preparedness, remote sensing is making an increasing contribution towards inventory development, hazard and risk assessment and logistical planning. After a disaster has occurred, remote sensing offers a rapid low-risk method of assessing damage to critical infrastructure and the urban built environment. In particular, high resolution coverage enabled the detection of bridge damage following the Northridge earthquake and collapsed buildings following various earthquakes in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Once the initial chaos has subsided, the value of remote sensing data lies in post-event monitoring; tracking changes in hazard location and extent. Reference is made to emergency operations following the World Trade Center attack, where remote sensing imagery supported various response efforts. In terms of secondary applications, details are given concerning innovative new research, using information derived from remote sensing coverage for running traffic rerouting programs, and as a supplementary data source for loss estimation models. © 2006 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

6863510,"Technology Transfer Trends In Indian Space Programme","Indian space programme, whose objectives involve acceleration of economic and social development through applications of space technology, has been engaged in the development of state-of-the-art satellite systems, launch vehicles and equipment necessary for applications. Even during the early phase of evolution of this Programme, deliberate policies have been adopted by the national space agency, namely, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), to promote spin-off benefit from the technologies developed for the use of space projects. Consistently adhering to this policy, ISRO has transferred over 280 technologies till date, spanning a wide spectrum of disciplines. This has resulted in a fruitful two-way cooperation between a number of SMEs and the ISRO. In order to make the technology transfer process effective. ISRO has adopted a variety of functional and organizational policies that included awareness building measures, licensee selection methods, innovative contract systems, diverse transfer processes, post licencing services and feedback mechanisms. Besides analyzing these policies and their evolution, the paper discusses various models adopted for technology transfer and their impact on assessment. It also touches upon relevant issues relating to creating interface between public funded R\&D and the private commercial enterprises. It suggests few models in which international cooperation could be pursued in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","{""Murthi, K. R. Sridhara"",""Shoba, T.

6862953,"Distinct Microalgae Species For Food-Part 1: A Methodological (Top-Down) Approach For The Life Cycle Assessment Of Microalgae Cultivation In Tubular Photobioreactors","Specific microalgae species are an adequate source of EPA and DHA and are able to provide a complete protein, which makes them highly interesting for human nutrition. However, microalgae cultivation has also been described to be energy intensive and environmentally unfavorable in pilot-scale reactors. Moreover, production in cold temperature zones has not been sufficiently investigated. In particular, the effects of tube materials and cultivation season length have rarely been previously investigated in the context of a comparative LCA of microalgae cultivation. A computational ""top-down"" model was conducted to calculate input flows forNannochloropsissp.andPhaeodactylum tricornutumcultivation in a hypothetical tubular photobioreactor. Cultivation processes were calculated according to detailed satellite climatic data for the chosen location in Central Germany. This model was applied to a set of different scenarios, including variations in photobioreactor material, tube diameter, microalgae species, and cultivation season length. Based on these data, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed following ISO standard 14040/44. The impact assessment comprised the global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, cumulative energy demand, and water scarcity. The results showed that a long cultivation season in spring and fall was always preferable in terms of environmental impacts, although productivity decreased significantly due to the climatic preconditions. Acrylic glass as a tube material had higher environmental impacts than all other scenarios. The cultivation of an alternative microalgae species showed only marginal differences in the environmental impacts compared with the baseline scenario. Critical processes in all scenarios included the usage of hydrogen peroxide for the cleaning of the tubes, nitrogen fertilizer, and electricity for mixing, centrifugation, and drying. Microalgae cultivation in a tubular photobioreactor in a ""cold-weather"" climate for food is sustainable and could possibly be a complement to nutrients from other food groups. The added value of this study lies in the detailed description of a complex and flexible microalgae cultivation model. The new model introduced in this study can be applied to numerous other scenarios to evaluate photoautotrophic microalgae cultivation in tubular photobioreactors. Thus, it is possible to vary the facility location, seasons, scale, tube dimensions and material, microalgae species, nutrient inputs, and flow velocity. Moreover, single processes can easily be complemented or exchanged to further adjust the model individually, if, for instance, another downstream pathway is required.","{""Meier, T."",""Schade, S.""}","10.1007/s10811-020-02177-2",2024-07-18 23:46:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Microalgae cultivation; LCA; Global warming; Environmental impacts; Nannochloropsissp; Photobioreact""}"
6863261,"Hydrological Modeling To Identify And Manage Critical Erosion-Prone Areas For Improving Reservoir Life: Case Study Of Barakar Basin","In this investigation, an effort was made to model the hydrology and to identify critical erosion-prone areas of the Barakar Basin (6,293km2) in Jharkhand state, India using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). This effort is helpful to select and adopt suitable soil conservation measures to reduce soil erosion. Input data include daily rainfall, and air temperature; and monthly runoff, sediment yield and reservoir inflow data of 5years. Additional data were the topographical map, soil map, land resource data, and satellite imageries of the study area. The model was calibrated and validated for monthly inflow to the Maithon and Tilaiya Reservoirs for the periods of 1997-1999 and 2000-2001, respectively. In addition, it was also calibrated and validated for monthly runoff and sediment yield from two subwatersheds (Banha and Karso), located within Barakar Basin for the monsoon season of the same period. The calibration and validation results established good agreement (less than 10\% deviation) between the observed- and model-predicted values in all cases. The identified critical areas using model-predicted sediment yield were compared with results of a report obtained from the Soil Conservation Department of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Hazaribagh. The erosion class map developed using simulation results matched spatially well with the DVC-prepared map based on sediment yield index. A management plan was developed to treat the subwatersheds with conservation practices. Subwatersheds were divided into seven priority classes for treating them sequentially to reduce reservoir sedimentation rate. In the model, conservation practices were accounted for through curve number, universal soil loss equation (USLE) cover factor, USLE support factor, and farm pond. Adaptation of the management plan resulted in decreased sedimentation rate. The sedimentation rate decreased from the current rate of 0.76 and 4.59mm3/year to 0.56 and 1.41mm3/year for Tilaiya and Maithon Reservoirs, respectively. Furthermore, the life of Tilaiya and Maithon Reservoirs increased by 29 and 166years, respectively. These results suggest that SWAT can be used to identify critical subwatersheds and to develop management plans to control erosion from critical areas by reducing the reservoir sedimentation rate.","{""Chatterjee, Chandranath"",""Raghuwanshi, Narendra S."",""Sardar, Bidhan"",""Singh, Amit Kumar""}","10.1061/(asce)he.1943-5584.0000749",2024-07-18 20:58:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{""Hydrologic models; Sediment; Watersheds; Reservoirs; Case studies; India; Hydrological model; SWAT; "",""reservoir life""}"
6903592,"Development Of A Data Management-System For The Kuwait Oil Fire Atmospheric Measurement Program","Following the onset of the Kuwait oil fires in early 1991, numerous efforts to monitor and estimate the environmental effects of the fires were initiated. These efforts produced a diverse set of atmospheric data from airborne, surface-based, and satellite platforms. Organizers of the experiments, including the World Meteorological Organization, quickly recognized the value of collecting all data into a central archive. This paper describes the development of that archive. Basic requirements for the archive were that it contain all pertinent datasets, including detailed documentation about each, and provide easy access to all interested researchers. The requirements were met by developing a database management system that contains a catalog of the data inventory and a facility to order specific datasets. A graphical user interface provides access to the database. In addition to the basic capability of searching the data inventory, the system has a number of other features, including a visual catalog of satellite images, a bibliography of relevant publications, and an extensive metadata collection describing the datasets. The system is accessible from the Internet or telephone/modem from a variety of terminal types, making it available to virtually anyone with a computer.

6691715,"A Decision Support System for Forest Fire Management","Forest fires are considered natural phenomena but the magnitude of the problem can be attributed to poor forest management and to the extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the abolishment of traditional activities related to forests has sent away people from the forests that they used to protect them. The aforementioned reasons result in the annual destruction of large forest areas, agricultural cultivations, industries, animals and even human lives. At the same time, catastrophic floods entail the gradual desolation of the affected areas and large amounts of carbon dioxide along with smoke particles aggravate air quality. In the present paper, a Decision Support System is proposed capable to support policy makers and services to counteract wildfires destruction danger in lowland Pine forests. The system is composed of two major components: (a) A Wildfire Destruction Danger Index useful for preventive and suppressive measures planning and decision policy making and (b) a Forest Management Planning Decision Support System useful for fire risk reduction through forest management plan. The open architecture of the system allows incorporation of data coming from external sources e.g. satellite systems, meteorological stations etc. All its subsystems can stand alone so as to satisfy the needs of responsible organisations (peripheral institutions of fire brigade, forest inspection and local authorities). The proposed system can be both used as an intergraded operational tool in forest fire management and as a training tool for personnel of various services involved.","{""Kaloudis, S.T.""}","https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02944167",2024-04-22 23:36:39,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2005,"{}","{""Wildfires|forest management|decision support systems|expert systems|geographic information systems""}"
6863136,"Valuing The Accessibility Of Green Spaces In The Housing Market: A Spatial Hedonic Analysis In Shanghai, China","As a crucial determinant of urban livability, the importance of access to high-quality green spaces has long been recognized for achieving sustainable urbanization. In urban areas, higher values are usually placed in residential properties with higher accessibility to green spaces. Using housing transaction data from as many as 3388 residential communities in Shanghai coupled with high-resolution satellite data of urban green spaces, we comprehensively examine the relationship between residential property values and the accessibility of both community-owned and public green spaces. We find, in instrumental-variable estimations, that: (1) home prices, on average, increase by 0.17\% if the overall green space accessibility rises by 1\%; and that (2) a 1\% increase in the green ratio within a community raises property values by 0.46\%. Moreover, the number of accessible green spaces, area of accessible green spaces, and distance to the nearest green spaces have positive impacts on home values separately. We also find strong spatial dependence in urban green spaces and unobserved price determinants, as well as heterogeneity by location, property value, and housing type. Our empirical findings provide valuable guidance for real estate developers and local governments in valuing environmental amenities and urban planning in the context of a residential housing market.","{""Ben, Shenglin"",""Lu, Jiajun"",""Wang, Renfeng"",""Zhu, He""}","10.3390/land12091660",2024-10-03 17:28:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""urban green spaces (UGS); housing market; spatial hedonic pricing; instrumental variable approach; S""}"
6862919,"Raising Standards While Watching The Bottom Line: Making A Business Case For Infection Control","While society would benefit from a reduced incidence of nosocomial infections, there is currently no direct reimbursement to hospitals for the purpose of infection control, which forces healthcare institutions to make economic decisions about funding infection control activities. Demonstrating value to administrators is an increasingly important function of the hospital epidemiologist because healthcare executives are faced with many demands and shrinking budgets. Aware of the difficulties that face local infection control programs, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) Board of Directors appointed a task force to draft this evidence-based guideline to assist hospital epidemiologists in justifying and expanding their programs. In Part 1, we describe the basic steps needed to complete a business-case analysis for an individual institution. A case study based on a representative infection control intervention is provided. In Part 2, we review important basic economic concepts and describe approaches that can be used to assess the financial impact of infection prevention, surveillance, and control interventions, as well as the attributable costs of specific healthcare-associated infections. Both parts of the guideline aim to provide the hospital epidemiologist, infection control professional, administrator, and researcher with the tools necessary to complete a thorough business-case analysis and to undertake an outcome study of a nosocomial infection or an infection control intervention. © 2007 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

Here we report on recent work to address some of these challenges for the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) fishery in the Parnaiba Delta Protected Area. These include meetings to create inter-sector communication, citizen science and ethnobiology to support data collection and biological sampling, satellite tagging to discern tarpon movements, and the first data-limited stock assessment. The research occurred between September 2018 and April 2020 in the Parnaiba Delta and adjacent marine area, specifically in the Canarias Islands (MA), Pedra do Sal (PI), and Bitupita (CE). Gonadosomatic indices (GSI > 5\%) of female tarpon suggested that tarpon migrate to the Parnaiba Delta to spawn in the dry season (July-December). These GSI findings corresponded with the ethnobiology results in which the fishers confirmed more intense fishing effort in the dry periods due in part to the added value of the gonads. Satellite-tagged tarpon remained close to the Buraco and Boca da Barra fishery areas, thus, close to the Parnaiba Delta region. The information collected here will enhance the collaborative formulation of an unprecedented management plan for the tarpon fishery in this region.","{""Adams, Aaron"",""Araujo, Alan C.

The montado (wood pasture) dominated systems of southern Portugal are a prime example, and experience high rates of land cover change. Tracking these changes is of importance for landscape level conservation and management. Whilst satellite remote sensing is the most realistic approach at large spatial scales, heterogeneous landscapes can present challenges to the accurate classification of land cover and its change. In this investigation we demonstrate a novel approach to the investigation of land cover change over a 25year period (1984-2009) in an area of importance for the conservation of the Iberian lynx, Black vulture, and other threatened biodiversity in south-east Alentejo, Portugal. We apply a Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) to Landsat imagery from these two years, and then Change Vector Analysis (CVA) on the transformed data to highlight areas of vegetation gain and loss during the intervening period. Using a 2009 land cover classification, and a set of rules based on these vegetation changes, we then predict the land change over the 25year period focussing on predominant classes of vegetation physiognomy.

Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed and reviewed the 374 articles on weather index insurance (WII) based on a systematic literature search on Web of Science and Scopus databases by using the systematic literature review method. Findings WII studies shifted their focus on growing and emerging areas of climate change impact risk. The finding shows that the impact of climate change risk significantly influenced the viability of WII in terms of pricing and design of WII. Therefore, the cost of WII premium increases due to the uncertainty of climate change impact that enhances the probability of losses related to insured weather risks. However, WII has emerged as a risk management tool of climate insurance for vulnerable agrarian communities. The efficacy of WII has been significantly influenced by repetitive environmental disasters and climate change phenomena. Research limitations/implications This study will be valuable for scholars to recognize the missing and emerging themes in WII. Practical implications This study will help the policy planners to understand the influence of climate change impact on WII viability. Originality/value This study is the original work of the author.

6862820,"Socio-Ecological Vulnerability In Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau: Evaluation, Driving Forces And Scenario Simulation","With the social and economic development in recent years, human activities have been more extensive and intensified. As a result, ecosystems are damaged to varying degrees, and regional ecological environments tend to be weaker. The socio-ecological system in Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau, China, the researched area, also faces increasingly serious problems. To advance ecological civilization development in a coordinated way across the country, the national government and the competent authorities have launched a series of new strategies. Research on socio-ecological vulnerability, a major part of the ecosystem protection and restoration program, is provided with powerful spatial data observation and analysis tools thanks to the invention and development of remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. This study was based on the vulnerability scoping diagram (VSD) framework. Multi-source data such as digital elevation model (DEM), geographical data such as land use types, soil and geological disasters, remote sensing image data, meteorological data and social statistics data from 2005 to 2019 were used to construct the temporal social-ecosystem vulnerability evaluation index database of Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau. The spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) is applied to evaluating the socio-ecological vulnerability and analyzing its spatial-temporal variation in Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau. To probe into the driving effects of various impact factors on the socio-ecological vulnerability, the Geodetector is used to analyze the driving factors. The ordered weighted average (OWA) method is applied to the multi-scenario analysis of socio-ecological vulnerability in the researched area. The conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2019, the spatial distribution characteristics of exposure and sensitivity in Aba Prefecture were higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest, and the overall spatial distribution characteristics of socio-ecological system vulnerability showed that the degree of vulnerability increased from the north to the southeast. (2) Extreme natural climate conditions play a leading role in the driving of socio-ecosystem vulnerability, followed by human production activities and geological hazards. (3) The degree of social-ecosystem vulnerability in Aba Prefecture will increase with the increase of decision risk coefficient. The results of social-ecosystem vulnerability under the status quo scenario are similar to those in 2010 and 2019, indicating that the selected evaluation factors can reflect the actual social-ecosystem vulnerability. In the sustainable guided scenario and the unsustainable guided scenario, the proportion of the area of the social-ecosystem severe vulnerability level was at the minimum value and the maximum value, respectively.","{""Dai, Xiaoai"",""Fu, Xiao"",""He, Yuxin"",""Li, Naiwen"",""Li, Weile"",""Li, Wenyu"",""Liu, Chao"",""Lu, Heng"",""Ma, Lei"",""Shan, Yunfeng"",""Wang, Youlin"",""Yang, Xingping"",""Yang, Zhengli""}","10.3390/ijgi11100524",2024-07-18 23:34:30,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""spatial analysis; socio-ecological system vulnerability; vulnerability scoping diagram framework; ge""}"

We investigate the relationship between green space and health as well as its underlying mechanism in Cali, Colombia. Results indicate that neighbourhood greenness is associated with enhanced self-rated ‘good’ health and reduced physical and mental distress. The health benefits of green space appear to be stronger for people living in wealthier neighbourhoods than those in poor neighbourhoods.

6863665,"‘My Own Slender Remarks’: Global Networks Of Slavery And Sociability In Mary Ann Parker’s Voyage To New South Wales (1795)","The long history of Terra Australis describes a space sketched in lines of speculation, ambition and multiple desire. Even at the end of the eighteenth century – after Cook’s exemplary curiosity and minute mapping produced the fabled space of Terra Australis as a place of English settlement and incarceration – knowledge of the new continent of Australia remained provisional and speculative. As was the case in its earliest incarnations, the representation of Terra Australis responds to contemporary preoccupations and imaginative investments, in this case the intermeshing late eighteenth-century realities of slavery, anti-slavery, trade, transportation and colonialism. Mary Ann Parker’s account of Australia shortly after European settlement reveals a network of such influences at work in her encounters with the landscape and culture of the new settlement. The Voyage Around the World (1795) positions Port Jackson at its narrative centre, but Parker’s perception of New South Wales is shaped by a broader circulation of people, information and ideas through the Atlantic. Parker’s approach to the colonial project at New South Wales is formed through anterior networks of hospitality and commerce connecting trading communities and colonial settlements along global travel routes. These material networks provide powerful cultural and ideological models for the voyageuse: the mediating values of Parker’s text are the forms of politeness and global hospitality she enjoys in the West Indies and the Cape, complicated by the ethical dilemmas of enforced labour. © Anne M.

6863268,"Soil Erosion And Degradation Assessment Integrating Multi-Parametric Methods Of Rusle Model, Rs, And Gis In The Shaqlawa Agricultural Area, Kurdistan Region, Iraq","This study evaluated soil erosion rates in the Shaqlawa district using the Geographical Information System (GIS)-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The primary objective was to identify areas within the district that are prone to significant erosion and develop appropriate soil conservation schemes accordingly. A combination of primary and secondary data from diverse sources was utilized to achieve this objective. The GIS-based RUSLE model used variables like soil erodibility (K), soil coverage (C), topographic effect (LS), rainfall runoff (R), and erosion control practices (P) to estimate the amount of soil that had been washed away in the study area. The study provided valuable information that can be used to plan and administer soil protection in the Shaqlawa district. The average yearly soil loss in the study region is estimated to be 65.66 t ha-1 year-1. The district is experiencing significant soil erosion rates, which may have detrimental effects on agricultural productivity, water quality, and environmental health. The analysis revealed that Balisan, Hiran, Shaqlawa center, and part of the Salahaddin subdistrict are the most affected areas, with high values of LS and R factors contributing to significant soil erosion rates. These results underscore the importance of soil protection and management efforts in the Shaqlawa district. The combination of the RUSLE with GIS and remote sensing techniques has been recognized as an essential, cost-effective, and highly accurate approach for estimating soil erosion.","{""Abdi, Badeea"",""Kolo, Kamal"",""Shahabi, Himan""}","10.1007/s10661-023-11796-4",2024-07-18 22:29:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Soil erosion; RUSLE; Topography; Shaqlawa; GIS; Remote sensing""}"

However, understanding how the community perceives a landscape is complex involving their experiences in that landscape, their lived experiences and other socio-cultural processes. One of the key challenges to understanding perception is linking the landscape properties to what is experienced when individuals interact with the landscape. Increasingly the use of geospatial data offers a tool for understanding the landscape and perceptions. This study compares satellite estimates of land use with the perceptions of the inhabitants of Yungay, Chile. Viewshed analysis is used to reconcile the differences seen in the satellite image cover estimates and those of the participants. It was found that restricting the cover estimate to the visible landscape, provided similar estimates of cover to those made by the participants. This varied between demographic groups.

6862997,"A Novel Modelling Approach To The Identification Of Optimum Sites For The Placement Of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (Otec) Power Plant: Application To The Tropical Island Climate Of Mauritius","The geographical location of Mauritius near the warm tropical waters of the Indian Ocean coupled to the vast exclusive economic zone approximating 2.3 million square kilometers, encourage the promotion of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems. Technological advancements have enabled offshore structures to pump the cold water lying at 1000m depth in the seawater column to the surface, and through the temperature difference set up with the warm surface layer, drives a turbine and generates electricity. In this study, a model has been developed to compute the temperature difference between the deep (1000m) and surface (20m) seawater layers around Mauritius. An algorithm has been implemented to determine the net power generated from a proposed OTEC power plant, acquired through the processing of sea surface temperature satellite images, at a resolution of 1 km. The spatial and temporal variations of the net power generated has been observed by splitting the annual data into four monsoonal time frames. Results show that the south-western region of Mauritius possesses high OTEC resources, with annual mean daily net power generation capacity of about 95MW, representing about 20\% of the peak power demand of the island. Moreover, the bathymetry of the southern region is propitious due to deep cold water availability at a proximity of less than 5km from the coastline. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the OTEC system are found to be 1.9 and 22.8\%, respectively. A cost-benefit analysis indicates that profits of the order of 4.5 times the initial investment can be generated.","{""Doorga, Jay Rovisham Singh"",""Gooroochurn, Oomarsing"",""Motah, Beenesh Anand"",""Ramchandur, Vimal"",""Sunassee, Shane""}","10.1007/s40095-018-0278-4",2024-09-27 23:21:33,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""OTEC; Mauritius; GIS; Mathematical modelling; Satellite remote sensing; Energy economics""}"

In this study, taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example, we compared a traditional machine learning method (random forest, RF) and three deep learning (DL) models, including DNN (deep neural networks), 1D-CNN (1D convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks) to predict crop yields by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data. The results showed that all four models could capture winter wheat yield variations in all the county-years, with R-2 of recorded and simulated yields ranging from 0.83 to 0.90 and RMSE ranging from 561.18 to 959.62 kg/ha. They all performed well for winter wheat yield prediction at a county level from 2011 to 2015, with mean R-2 >= 0.85 and RMSE <= 768 kg/ha. At a field level, the spatial pattern of estimated winter wheat yield could capture the spatial heterogeneity and yield differences between individual fields across a county fairly well. However, only the DNN and RF models had relatively good performance at the field level, with mean R2 values of 0.71, 0.66 and RMSE values of 1127 kg/ha and 956 kg/ha, respectively. The model comparisons showed that the performance of RF was not always worse than DL at both the county and field levels.

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has set up a dedicated crosscutting service, which is the so-called ""Center for satellite-based Crisis Information"" (ZKI), to facilitate the use of its Earth-observation capacities in the service of national and international response to major disaster situations, humanitarian relief efforts, and civil security issues. This paper describes successful rapid satellite mapping campaigns supporting disaster relief and demonstrates how this technology can be used for civilian crisis-management purposes. During the last years, various international coordination bodies were established, improving the disaster-response-related cooperation within the Earth-observation community worldwide. DLR/ZKI operates in this context, closely networking with public authorities (civil security), nongovernmental organizations (humanitarian relief organizations), satellite operators, and other space agencies.

6863671,"Change And Comparison Of Agricultural Landscape Patterns And Ecological Service Values In Karst And Non-Karst Areas: A Case Study Of Quanzhou County","The research area is Quanzhou county in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a typical Karst Hilly Basin. Based on the theory of landscape patterns and ecosystem service values, use the results of the interpretation of TM remote sensing images and socio-economic data in 2005, 2010 and 2015, and combined with GIS and Fragstats software to analyze and compare the changes of Agricultural landscape pattern and corresponding changes of ecological service value during 2005-2015.The analysis and comparison were carried out and the results showed that: 1) From 2005 to 2015, the spatial distribution of agricultural landscape in karst and non-karst areas of Quanzhou county changed to a certain extent, with obvious changes in the central and southern regions of karst areas and relatively scattered changes in non-karst areas. In agricultural landscape, the increase of water area in non-karst area is more than twice that of karst area, but the dominant landscape types of karst and non-karst areas have not changed. In both regions, the agricultural landscape has undergone significant changes, but the rate of change in karst area is greater, indicating that the change in karst area is stronger and more significant than that in non-karst areas. 2) In the past 10 years, the area of agricultural landscape in Karst was reduced by 472.23 hm2, and the non Karst area decreased by 476.28 hm2, but the reduction rate of Karst area was higher than that of non Karst region. Compared with the non Karst area, the landscape in Karst area is more fragmented, the patch shape is more dispersed and complex, and the landscape heterogeneity is even higher. On the one hand, the change of landscape pattern in karst and non-karst areas is due to the requirements of urban construction, industry and traffic layout. On the other hand is affected by the policy, making agricultural landscape internal change. 3) In the past 10 years, the total value of ecosystem services in prefectures and counties increased continuously, but the increase was small. In addition, the value of ecosystem services was reduced by RMB 1 million in karst areas. On the contrary, District ecosystem service value it increased by RMB 4 million in the non-karst areas. It can be seen that human activities have affected both karst and non-karst areas, but the influence of karst area is larger, leads to a decrease in karst area ecosystem service value. Among them, the largest contribution rate to the decrease of service value of the two regional ecosystems is the decrease of forested land, which reaches 78% in karst area and 83% in non-karst area. During the study period, although the value of ecosystem services provided by woodland decreased, the value of ecosystem services provided by water landscape increased. The increased value of ecosystem services in the two regions is due to the increase in water landscape. Since the forestry has a decisive role in the value of the ecosystem services of the two regions, it would be helpful to improve the ecosystem services of the study area, and improve the overall value of ecosystem services in the study area. © Tropical Geography 2018.","{""Hu, B."",""Li, X."",""Shi, S."",""Tang, C."",""Xie, B."",""Yan, Y.""}","10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003060",2024-07-17 16:59:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Agricultural landscape patterns"",""Karst Areas"",""Quanzhou County"",""Value of ecosystem services""}"
6863005,"The Evolution Of Irrigation Effects On Agricultural Drought Mitigation In North China","Drought is one of the most common natural threats to agricultural production worldwide. Few studies have studied the effects of agricultural practices on drought mitigation at a regional scale over a long period. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics in the agricultural drought-affected area change index (ADAC), which was developed to assess the drought mitigation. The linear regression method was used to investigate the impact factors on the change of ADAC in the three main winter wheat provinces of northern China. The results showed that the average ADAC during the main growing season in the study area was approximately -61.5\% over the past 38 years, which indicated a great decrease of the agricultural drought-affected area. The significant decreasing trends of ADAC values across the study area during 1981-2000 could be explained by the area percentage equipped for irrigation (APEI) by 49.2-89.7\%. There was a lack of pronounced change trends of ADAC during 2001-2018, implying that the positive effects of irrigation infrastructure in the plain area might reach a plateau under the constraints of available water resources, and other agricultural practices need to be investigated in the future. This research provides helpful decision information on drought adaptation management and water conservation project planning.","{""Bulgan, Davdai"",""Ma, Zonghan"",""Wu, Bingfang"",""Yan, Nana"",""Zhang, Xiwang"",""Zhu, Weiwei""}","10.3390/rs14205197",2024-07-19 20:19:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""agricultural drought; drought mitigation; irrigation infrastructure; remote sensing""}"
6863100,"Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables For Spatially Predicting The Risks Of Bark Beetle Disturbance","Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.","{""Berec, Ludek"",""Braaten, Justin"",""Broz, Zdenek"",""Bruna, Josef"",""Hais, Martin"",""Kennedy, Robert"",""Wild, Jan""}","10.3390/rs8080687",2024-07-18 23:37:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2016,"{}","{""forest disturbance; spectral trajectories; bark beetle; Landsat""}"
6863018,"Using Deep Ensemble Forest For High-Resolution Mapping Of Pm2.5 From Modis Maiac Aod In Tehran, Iran","High-resolution mapping of PM2.5 concentration over Tehran city is challenging because of the complicated behavior of numerous sources of pollution and the insufficient number of ground air quality monitoring stations. Alternatively, high-resolution satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data can be employed for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5. For this purpose, different data-driven methods have been used in the literature. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated their ability to estimate PM2.5 from AOD data. However, these methods have several weaknesses in solving the problem of estimating PM2.5 from satellite AOD data. In this paper, the potential of the deep ensemble forest method for estimating the PM2.5 concentration from AOD data was evaluated. The results showed that the deep ensemble forest method with R-2 = 0.74 gives a higher accuracy of PM2.5 estimation than deep learning methods ( R-2 = 0.67 ) as well as classic data-driven methods such as random forest ( R-2 = 0.68 ). Additionally, the estimated values of PM2.5 using the deep ensemble forest algorithm were used along with ground data to generate a high-resolution map of PM2.5. Evaluation of produced PM2.5 map revealed the good performance of the deep ensemble forest for modeling the variation of PM2.5 in the city of Tehran.","{""Bagheri, Hossein""}","10.1007/s10661-023-10951-1",2024-10-03 17:30:25,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2023,"{}","{""Air pollution; PM2.5 measurements; AOD measurements; Deep ensemble forest; Deep; learning; Deep mode""}"
6863605,"The Use Of Syndromic Surveillance For Decision-Making During The H1n1 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Background: Although an increasing number of studies are documenting uses of syndromic surveillance by front line public health, few detail the value added from linking syndromic data to public health decision-making. This study seeks to understand how syndromic data informed specific public health actions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Methods. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with participants from Ontario's public health departments, the provincial ministry of health and federal public health agency to gather information about syndromic surveillance systems used and the role of syndromic data in informing specific public health actions taken during the pandemic. Responses were compared with how the same decisions were made by non-syndromic surveillance users. Results: Findings from 56 interviews (82% response) show that syndromic data were most used for monitoring virus activity, measuring impact on the health care system and informing the opening of influenza assessment centres in several jurisdictions, and supporting communications and messaging, rather than its intended purpose of early outbreak detection. Syndromic data had limited impact on decisions that involved the operation of immunization clinics, school closures, sending information letters home with school children or providing recommendations to health care providers. Both syndromic surveillance users and non-users reported that guidance from the provincial ministry of health, communications with stakeholders and vaccine availability were driving factors in these public health decisions. Conclusions: Syndromic surveillance had limited use in decision-making during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Ontario. This study provides insights into the reasons why this occurred. Despite this, syndromic data were valued for providing situational awareness and confidence to support public communications and recommendations. Developing an understanding of how syndromic data are utilized during public health events provides valuable evidence to support future investments in public health surveillance. © 2012 Chu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","{""Chu, A."",""Crowcroft, N.

6863121,"The Surface Geology Of The Prince Edward Islands: Refined Spatial Data And Call For Geoconservation","Volcanological maps of the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands were first published in 1968, with a revised surface geology map of Marion Island produced in 2006. These maps have been widely used in terrestrial studies on the Prince Edward Islands but they have limitations in spatial accuracy and detail. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation data, more spatially accurate data for both Prince Edward and Marion Island’s surface geology are presented here. In particular, Marion Island’s volcanology on the western coast, including the 1980s lava flow, and the newly exposed Central Highland following the disappearance of extensive ice and snow cover is mapped with greater detail and verified through field observations.

6863139,"A Complex Aerosol Transport Event Over Europe During The 2017 Storm Ophelia In Cams Forecast Systems: Analysis And Evaluation","In mid-October 2017 Storm Ophelia crossed over western coastal Europe, inducing the combined transport of Saharan dust and Iberian biomass burning aerosols over several European areas. In this study we assess the performance of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecast systems during this complex aerosol transport event and the potential benefits that data assimilation and regional models could bring. To this end, CAMS global and regional forecast data are analysed and compared against observations from passive (MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard Terra and Aqua) and active (CALIOP/CALIPSO: Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite sensors and ground-based measurements (EMEP: European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme). The analysis of the CAMS global forecast indicates that dust and smoke aerosols, discretely located on the warm and cold fronts of Ophelia, respectively, were affecting the aerosol atmospheric composition over Europe during the passage of the Storm. The observed MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are satisfactorily reproduced by the CAMS global forecast system, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and a fractional gross error (FGE) of 0.4. The comparison with a CAMS global control simulation not including data assimilation indicates a significant improvement in the bias due to data assimilation implementation, as the FGE decreases by 32 \%. The qualitative evaluation of the IFS (Integrated Forecast System) dominant-aerosol type and location against the CALIPSO observations overall reveals a good agreement. Regarding the footprint on air quality, both CAMS global and regional forecast systems are generally able to reproduce the observed signal of increase in surface particulate matter concentrations. The regional component performs better in terms of bias and temporal variability, with the correlation deteriorating over forecast time. Yet, both products exhibit inconsistencies on the quantitative and temporal representation of the observed surface particulate matter enhancements, stressing the need for further development of the air quality forecast systems for even more accurate and timely support of citizens and policy-makers.","{""Akritidis, Dimitris"",""Douros, John"",""Eskes, Henk"",""Flemming, Johannes"",""Georgoulias, Aristeidis K."",""Inness, Antje"",""Kartsios, Stergios"",""Katragkou, Eleni"",""Zanis, Prodromos""}","10.5194/acp-20-13557-2020",2024-07-19 21:16:28,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{calibration}",NA
6862806,"Where The Wild Things Are: Using Remotely Sensed Forest Productivity To Assess Arboreal Marsupial Species Richness And Abundance","Aim: Highly productive areas have long been hypothesized to support a greater abundance and diversity of animals than less productive areas. However, evidence for this is equivocal and, until recently, has been difficult to test at a landscape level. For the first time, we use imaging spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between plant productivity and arboreal mammal species richness and abundance at a landscape scale. Location: A eucalypt forest in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Using a common index of plant productivity - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - as a proxy for available energy, we test the ability of species-energy theory and optimal foraging theory to explain variations in arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance. We obtained NDVI data from an airborne imaging spectrophotometer. Results: Species richness increased in relation to NDVI among 53 eucalypt forest sites, based on five arboreal marsupial species. The presence and abundance of a eucalypt folivore specialist, Petauroides volans, increased in relation to NDVI. The relative abundance of all arboreal marsupials collectively also increased in relation to NDVI among sites, even with P. volans data excluded. In support of optimal foraging theory, the observed locations of P. volans had a higher NDVI value than the average for sampling transects. In addition, the average NDVI of eucalypt forest remnants was positively related to the overall abundance of P. volans. An important caveat is that NDVI did not explain all the variation in arboreal marsupial populations. Main conclusions: Assuming that NDVI is an appropriate proxy for available energy in a eucalypt forest, our results are consistent with predictions from species-energy and optimal foraging theories. Remotely sensed measures of productivity and forage quality, used in conjunction with other important landscape characteristics, provide a potentially powerful tool to evaluate habitat and biodiversity hotspots at scales relevant to wildlife management and conservation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","{""Held, A.

6903487,"Trends Of Greening And Browning In Terrestrial Vegetation In China From 2000 To 2020","Terrestrial vegetation condition is altering generally as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activity during the past few decades. To reveal the impact of long-term climate factors and artificial protection on multiple vegetation types, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of vegetation greening and browning and the effect of national ecological restoration programs. In this study, we established a persistent vegetation change index (P-value) to characterize greening (restoration) and browning (degradation) in China in 2000-2020. Firstly, we generated annual time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS product by averaging the monthly maximum NDVI values for each year. Secondly, we calculated the Pvalue to investigate the continuous change in vegetation state by incremental time interval. Finally, patterns and trends of greening and browning in forests, shrublands, and grasslands were quantified and mapped at pixel and sample point levels. The findings of our study revealed that Chinese wild vegetated lands greened up by -3.4 x 104 km2 (25\%) and turned brown in -1.6 x 104 km2 (11\%) between 2000 and 2020. Net greening was detected in all biomes, most conspicuously in several ecological program regions in northern China. The NDVI time-series data in 31\% of field plots showed a consistent result, 11\% of field plots showed a browning trend, and 58\% of field plots showed a stable state. These results indicated a synergistic effect on forests, shrublands, and grasslands, but with regional variations attributed to differences in precipitation abundance, the implementation of positive ecological programs by the government and negative human activities. Additionally, these findings provide valuable insight into large-scale terrestrial vegetation transitions and have practical applications for decision-making and policy development in the assessment and restoration of ecosystems aimed at reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and conserving water resources in China.",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110587",2024-10-03 22:29:19,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6691611,"Earth observation science strategy for ESA: a new era for scientific advances and societal benefits","Thanks to the ERS and Envisat workhorse satellites and the series of ongoing and planned Earth Explorer missions, our scientific understanding of Earth has come a long way in recent decades. While science continues to reap the benefits of these missions, we are now in a new era where Earth observation also plays a pivotal role in environmental management systems to benefit society at large and everyday life. The launch of the first Sentinel mission for Europe’s environmental monitoring Copernicus programme signalled a new beginning for operational monitoring. Accordingly, ESA’s new Earth observation science strategy takes a holistic approach that responds to both scientific and societal challenges. Developing new and integrated observing systems, ensuring sustained observations and capabilities to fill gaps in current observing systems, building on well-established international cooperation and taking advantage of the major technological advances in computing capabilities, modelling and data handling not only advances knowledge, but also has cross-cutting impacts. The value of Earth observation is increasingly recognised beyond the traditional fields. Today’s paradigm shift towards open access to data, big data and exascale computing, collaborative approaches and analyses, as well as new ways of visualising and communicating data mean that Earth observation is at society’s fingertips. In essence, as these rapidly evolving technologies become more commonplace and improvements in the ways in which data can be exploited and transformed into knowledge, the better we can address environmental, scientific and societal challenges, adapt to change and improve our way of life. In turn, new knowledge feeds back into new challenges, thereby continuing the process.","{""[ESA]European Space Agency""}","https://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/SP-1329_1/SP-1329-1.pdf",2024-04-22 23:27:50,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}",NA
6863445,"Comparative Assessment Of The Diffusion Of Traditional Leafy Vegetables With Satellite And Innovation Platforms Methods In Benin","Innovation platforms (IPs) are perceived today as the best approaches to the development and promotion of innovations compared to previous satellite diffusion methods (SDM). Most of the previous studies have focused on the outcomes of implementing IP without addressing the underlying factors. The success or failure factors of these new approaches remain unclear. The present study seeks to compare the factors of the institutional environment that influence the results of implementation of traditional leafy vegetable (LFT) platforms to SDM results. Four case studies including two IPs and two SDMs were chosen in a reasoned way in terms of the importance or not of the market dynamics (whether or not there are any inputs market, LFT sales markets, establishment of formal or informal sales links, etc.) and the diversity of organizations (the existence of OP, importance of NGOs and support project, intervention of local structures, gender, etc.). These cases are presented following an analytical framework combining innovation systems and functionnal analysis. Data is collected through structured, semi-structured interviews, direct observations, testimonials, etc. The data collected relates to each stage of the implementation process and concerns the actors (types of actors, profile of the actors, relationships developed, roles, attitudes, practices, perceptions, etc.), the different activities carried out (entrepreneurial, learning, dissemination of innovations, investment in developed markets, mobilization of human resources, material financial resources, lobbying of interest groups), difficulties encountered and approaches to solutions. The method of analysis is essentially qualitative. The results showed that IPs as well as SDM are influenced by the previous existence of market in the implementation context. IP cannot work when traders do not show interest in the product including TLV on which study focused. We recommend for scaling up innovations that IP initiatives take this factor into account to ensure the effectiveness of its implementation. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

6863289,"Testing The Utility Of The Blue Spectral Region In Burned Area Mapping: Insights From Savanna Wildfires","Monitoring ecosystem events such as wildfires with remote sensing is fundamental to natural resources management. However, precisely delineating burned areas with remote sensing remains a challenge for post-fire ecological assessment. Burned area mapping methods with spectral indices are affected by several interferences such as soil background, water surfaces and atmospheric effects. In this study, we test the applicability of a normalized difference spectral index with the shortwave infrared and blue spectral bands in accurately mapping burned areas. The spectral index was tested in two study sites and compared to six spectral indices commonly used in burned area mapping. Random forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify the spectral indices and map burned areas. Although the True Skill Statistic (TSS) was relatively low, we found out that the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and Normalized Burned Index (NBI) performed better than all the other spectral indices considered in the two study sites. The Burned Area Index (BAI) was the third highest performing spectral index. OSAVI and NBI performed well in the study sites plausibly because they were adjusted for soil effects and the blue spectral band was included to account for atmospheric effects. Our results indicate the need to adjust spectral indices for soil, water and atmospheric effects when using them for burned area mapping. The study also adds rudimentary knowledge on the potential of the blue spectral band in monitoring burned area vegetation.","{""Kadzunge, Shamiso Lynnet"",""Mpakairi, Kudzai Shaun"",""Ndaimani, Henry""}","10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100365",2024-09-30 01:29:41,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Burned-area; NBI; OSAVI; Savannah; Random forest""}"

6903643,"Role And Impact Of Urban Water Prices On The Management Of Groundwater Consumption Due To Covid-19 Outbreaks","The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental role and impact of urban water prices, and hence its consumption in Tehran on its groundwater level drawdown. The issue gets vital in times of drought when the scarcity value of water exceeds benefits of groundwater environmental flow. Hence, the argument is that urban water tariffs may play a role in managing groundwater flow. In this regard, the harmful impact of urban water consumption on the environmental flow of groundwater resources is distinguished. Then the objective would be to identify determinants of urban water consumption. To do so, an urban water's demand function, including important key regressors such as price, income, temperature, and rainfall is estimated. Moreover, the role of Covid-19 in urban water consumption is highlighted. Results show a demand elasticity of -0.29 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 for urban water consumption, or that a 10 percent increase in average price results in a decline in urban water consumption of 1.9-3.9 percent. In addition, one percent lower urban water consumption causes 1.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 percent less groundwater extraction, or that response of a 10 percent decrease in the consumption could cause a decline in groundwater extraction of 12-14 percent. Last but not least, a 1 percent decrease in underground extraction for urban water raises 13.2 \& PLUSMN; 6.7 cm of GRACE water level after three months. The results show that groundwater exploitation for urban drinking water is a responsible contributor to the water level drawdown in Tehran. In addition, the significant elasticity of 0.29 shows that price mechanisms are useful to manage hydrological scarcity and the consequent disasters. Moreover, observing significant effects of covid-related determinants for calming down the upward trend of groundwater extraction, we alert for postcovid deterioration of subsidence areas due to regrowth of water consumption.",NA,"10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100996",2024-09-27 22:41:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6447819,"Optimizing wetland restoration to improve water quality at a regional scale","Excessive phosphorus (P) export to aquatic ecosystems can lead to impaired water quality. There is a growing interest among watershed managers in using restored wetlands to retain P from agricultural landscapes and improve water quality. We develop a novel framework for prioritizing wetland restoration at a regional scale. The framework uses an ecosystem service model and an optimization algorithm that maximizes P reduction for given levels of restoration cost. Applying our framework in the Lake Champlain Basin, we find that wetland restoration can reduce P export by 2.6% for a budget of 50 M and 5.1% for a budget of 200 M. Sensitivity analysis shows that using finer spatial resolution data for P sources results in twice the P reduction benefits at a similar cost by capturing hot-spots on the landscape. We identify 890 wetlands that occur in more than 75% of all optimal scenarios and represent priorities for restoration. Most of these wetlands are smaller than 7 ha with contributing area less than 100 ha and are located within 200 m of streams. Our approach provides a simple yet robust tool for targeting restoration efforts at regional scales and is readily adaptable to other restoration strategies.","{""Gourevitch, Jesse D."",""Polasky, Stephen"",""Ricketts, Taylor H."",""Rizzo, Donna M."",""Singh, Nitin K."",""Watson, Keri B."",""Wemple, Beverley C.""}","10.1088/1748-9326/ab1827",NA,NA,NA,2019,"{}",NA
6863081,"Response To Resources And Parasites Depends On Health Status In Extensively Grazed Sheep","A fundamental question in animal ecology is how an individual's internal state and the external environment together shape species distributions across habitats. The increasing availability of biologgers is driving a revolution in answering this question in a wide range of species. In this study, the position of sheep (Ovis aries) from Global Positioning System collars was integrated with remote sensing data, field sampling of parasite distributions, and parasite load and health measures for each tagged individual. This allowed inter-individual variation in habitat use to be examined. Once controlling for a positive relationship between vegetation productivity and tick abundance, healthier individuals spent more of their time at sites with higher vegetation productivity, while less healthy individuals showed a stronger (negative) response to tick abundance. These trends are likely to represent a trade-off in foraging decisions that vary between individuals based on their health status. Given the rarity of studies that explore how animal distributions are affected by health and external factors, we demonstrate the value of integrating biologging technology with remote sensing data, traditional ecological sampling and individual measures of animal health. Our study, using extensively grazed sheep as a model system, opens new possibilities to study free-living grazing systems. © 2020 The Authors.

6691566,"Capacity Building Approach and Application: Utilization of Earth Observation Data and Geospatial Information Technology in the Hindu Kush Himalaya","While the Earth observation (EO) data and geospatial information technology (GIT) are getting more open and accessible, lack of skilled human resources and institutional capacities are limiting effective applications in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formats—standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participants’ expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topics—from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issues—were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies. The ADIM approach and its workflow focused on bridging the gap between the current trend and progression in EO and GIT fields and the existing state of capacity of the agencies involved in the decision-making process. It promoted gender equity, adopted frontier technologies, engaged SMEs and provided sustainable solutions, which are starting to bring success stories in the region.","{""Thapa, Rajesh""}","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00165",2024-04-22 23:35:29,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""capacity building|informal education|SME, SERVIR|GIT|HKH region""}"
6903504,"Deep Learning For Automatic Outlining Agricultural Parcels: Exploiting The Land Parcel Identification System","Accurate and up-to-date information on the spatial and geographical characteristics of agricultural areas is an indispensable value for the various activities related to agriculture and research. Most agricultural studies and policies are carried out at the field level, for which precise boundaries are required. Today, high-resolution remote sensing images provide useful spatial information for plot delineation; however, manual processing is time-consuming and prone to human error. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning (DL) approach, in particular a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, for the automatic outlining of agricultural plot boundaries from orthophotos over large areas with a heterogeneous landscape. Since DL approaches require a large amount of labeled data to learn, we have exploited the open data from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) from the Chartered Community of Navarre, Spain. The boundaries of the agricultural plots obtained from our methodology were compared with those obtained using a state-of-the-art methodology known as gPb-UCM (global probability of boundary followed by ultrametric contour map) through an error measurement called the boundary displacement error index (BDE). In BDE terms, the results obtained by our method outperform those obtained from the gPb-UCM method. In this regard, CNN models trained with LPIS data are a useful and powerful tool that would reduce intensive manual labor in outlining agricultural plots. © 2013 IEEE.",NA,"10.1109/access.2019.2950371",2024-10-03 21:57:58,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA

6903571,"Fusion Of Lidar And Aerial Imagery To Map Wetlands And Channels Via Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Wetlands and channels provide significant ecological and societal services. Mapping their locations and types at high resolution remains a challenge for scientific communities and regulatory agencies. In the U.S.A., the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) provides the best nationwide wetland maps, but the NWI for some locations has not been updated for up to four decades and includes omission errors. To address these problems, we developed a deep learning framework for identifying wetlands and channels from lidar point clouds and 1 m aerial images. Both deep learning and terrain analysis were applied to classify wetlands and identify channels. The deep learning classifier was a convolutional neural network that utilized both image color information and lidar-derived canopy height. When tested on a 94 km(2) Ohio watershed, the method achieved a classification accuracy of 85.6\%. Compared with the NWI maps, the results included 76\% more forested wetlands by area and 168\% more channels by length. It was also found that only leaf-off images were useful for detecting forested wetlands and typical commission errors (i.e., false positives) were attributed to tree shadows. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining lidar structural and aerial spectral information over the use of each alone and exemplifies the utility of deep learning as an effective means to leverage open-source data for high resolution mapping of wetlands.",NA,"10.1177/03611981221095522",2024-10-03 22:04:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863191,"Diversification Of Land Surface Temperature Change Under Urban Landscape Renewal: A Case Study In The Main City Of Shenzhen, China","Unprecedented rapid urbanization in China during the past several decades has been accompanied by extensive urban landscape renewal, which has increased the urban thermal environmental risk. However, landscape change is a sufficient but not necessary condition for land surface temperature (LST) variation. Many studies have merely highlighted the correlation between landscape pattern and LST, while neglecting to comprehensively present the spatiotemporal diversification of LST change under urban landscape renewal. Taking the main city of Shenzhen as a case study area, this study tracked the landscape renewal and LST variation for the period 1987-2015 using 49 Landsat images. A decision tree algorithm suitable for fast landscape type interpretation was developed to map the landscape renewal. Analytical tools that identified hot-cold spots, the gravity center, and transect of LST movement were adopted to identify LST changes. The results showed that the spatial variation of LST was not completely consistent with landscape change. The transformation from Green landscape to Grey landscape usually increased the LST within a median of 0.2 degrees C, while the reverse transformation did not obviously decrease the LST (the median was nearly 0 degrees C). The median of LST change from Blue landscape to Grey landscape was 1.0 degrees C, corresponding to 0.5 degrees C in the reverse transformation. The imbalance of LST change between the loss and gain of Green or Blue landscape indicates the importance of protecting natural space, where the benefits in terms of temperature mitigation cannot be completely substituted by reverse transformation.","{""Liu, Yanxu"",""Peng, Jian"",""Wang, Yanglin""}","10.3390/rs9090919",2024-10-03 17:42:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""landscape transformation; temperature mitigation; decision tree; urbanization""}"
6863153,"Vegetation-Based Ecosystem Service Delivery In Urban Landscapes: A Systematic Review","The use of plants in cities and the ecosystem services they provide has attracted increased attention both publicly and within the research literature. Increasingly, the value of urban green and blue space is being recognised for its multiple benefits to human wellness and ecological integrity.\& nbsp;A quantitative assessment of studies considering nature-based solutions and ecosystem services can identify the current evidence -base for improving the provisioning of plant ecosystem services management and understanding barriers to adoption of nature-based solutions. Here, we provide a systematic review of the literature to characterise the current state of research on ecosystem service provision by urban blue and green space.\& nbsp;We identified 684 relevant studies on urban plant literature and extracted key research themes. Studies were generally focused on terrestrial systems (89\%) compared to aquatic systems such as blue space (11\%). Geographically most studies were focused on Europe (39\%), Asia (23\%), and N. America (22\%). Trees were the most frequently reported vegetation type studies (29\%) followed by generic vegetation (20\%), grassland (11\%), forest (7\%), and aquatic vegetation (5\%). Many studies were short (41\%), collecting data only over a single year or single field season. Many of the long-term studies are concerning land use/land cover change. Most studies (64\%) were conducted for less than five years. The most-reported methodology was remote sensing technology (15\%), followed by field surveys (8\%), stakeholder surveys (6\%), and ecosystem service models (5\%). The most-reported ecosystem service types were regulation and maintenance (54\%), cultural (28\%), and provisioning (16\%). Only a small number of studies looked solely at disservice (1\%) or discussed ecosystem services in generic terms. Disservices were reported in only 16\% of studies with the greatest single category of a disservice being biogenic volatile organic compounds and allergenic potential. Few studies (13\%) reported on the use of nature-based solutions and these 80\% only focused on a single nature-based solution. There was a lack of detail on plant species, 68\% (n = 468) did not list the species studied.\& nbsp;We conclude that there is a broad spectrum of research on urban vegetation services, overall, the focus of the literature is uneven. Research should seek to examine the species-specific responses to urbanisation and counter geographic disparities. There is also a need for longitudinal experimental data to identify the functioning and ecosystem service provision of green infrastructure in both urban green and blue space and factors that influence performance over policy-and management-relevant timescales.

6863627,"Spectral Detection Of Stress-Related Pigments In Salt-Lake Succulent Halophytic Shrubs","The spectral detection of vegetation pigment concentrations has a high potential value, but it is still underdeveloped, especially for pigments other than chlorophylls. In this study, the seasonal pigment dynamics of two Tecticornia species (samphires; halophytic shrubs) from north-western Australia were correlated with spectral indices that best document the pigment changes over time. Pigment dynamics were assessed by analysing betacyanin, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations at plant level and by measuring reflectance at contrasting seasonal dates. Plant reflectance was used to define a new reflectance index that was most sensitive to the seasonal shifts in Tecticornia pigment concentrations. The two Tecticornia species turned from green to red-pinkish for the period March–August 2012 when betacyanins increased almost nine times in both species. Chlorophyll levels showed the opposite pattern to that of betacyanins, whereas carotenoid levels were relatively stable. Normalised difference indices correlated well with betacyanin (r = 0.805, using bands at 600 and 620 nm) and chlorophyll (r = 0.809, using bands at 737 and 726 nm). Using knowledge of chlorophyll concentrations slightly improved the ability of the spectral index to predict betacyanin concentration (r = 0.822 at bands 606 and 620 nm, in the case of chemically determined chlorophyll, r = 0.809 when using remotely sensed chlorophyll). Our results suggest that this new spectral index can reliably detect changes in betacyanin concentrations in vegetation, with potential applications in ecological studies and environmental impact monitoring. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","{""Colmer, T.

6863575,"Reference Upper-Air Observations For Climate Rationale, Progress, And Plans","While the global upper-air observing network has provided useful observations for operational weather forecasting for decades, its measurements lack the accuracy and long-term continuity needed for understanding climate change. Consequently, the scientific community faces uncertainty on key climate issues, such as the nature of temperature trends in the troposphere and stratosphere; the climatology, radiative effects, and hydrological role of water vapor in the upper troposphere and stratosphere; and the vertical profile of changes in atmospheric ozone, aerosols, and other trace constituents. Radiosonde data provide adequate vertical resolution to address these issues, but they have questionable accuracy and time-varying biases due to changing instrumentation and techniques. Although satellite systems provide global coverage, their vertical resolution is sometimes inadequate and they require independent reference observations for sensor and data product validation, and for merging observations from different platforms into homogeneous climate records. To address these shortcomings, and to ensure that future climate records will be more useful than the records to date, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) program is initiating a GCOS Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) to provide high-quality observations using specialized radiosondes and complementary remote sensing profiling instrumentation that can be used for validation. This paper outlines the scientific rationale for GRUAN, its role in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, network requirements and likely instrumentation, management structure, current status, and future plans. It also illustrates the value of prototype reference upper-air observations in constructing climate records and their potential contribution to the Global Space-Based Inter-Calibration System. We invite constructive feedback on the GRUAN concept and the engagement of the scientific community.","{""Berger, Franz H."",""Diamond, Howard J."",""Dykema, John"",""Goodrich, David"",""Immler, Franz"",""Murray, William"",""Peterson, Thomas"",""Seidel, Dian J."",""Sisterson, Douglas"",""Sommer, Michael"",""Thorne, Peter"",""Voemel, Holger"",""Wang, Junhong""}","10.1175/2008bams2540.1",2024-07-19 18:53:49,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2009,"{}",NA
6863635,"Drought Impact Assessment Based On Principal Component Analysis And Copula Function","Drought is one of the most important agricultural disasters in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Assessing the influence of the droughts in the plain accurately can provide reference for drought mitigation and maintaining stable crop yields. Based on remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which was calculated at ten-day intervals for monitoring droughts in the years of 2008-2013 in the plain, the Copula function method was used to assess the effect of drought at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yields. The mutually independent principal factors were extracted from the VTCIs at the main growth stages of winter wheat by using principal component analysis (PCA), overcoming difficulty of parameter estimation for multivariate Copula, and then incorporated into the Copula function to establish a PCA-Copula method. The comprehensive values of VTCIs at the main growth stages were determined by the PCA-Copula method, and then linear regression model between the comprehensive VTCIs and wheat yields was established to assess the effect of drought on the yields. The results showed that the linear correlation coefficient between the wheat yields and comprehensive VTCIs was at the extremely significant level (P<0.001). Compared with the linear regression model based on the entropy value method, the determination coefficient of the model with the PCA-Copula method reached 0.49 from 0.39, which indicated that the fitting degree of the model was improved, and the root mean square error and average relative error between the estimated and measured yields reduced by 30.2 kg/hm2 and 0.66%, respectively. These results indicated that the PCA-Copula method was a better approach for accessing the impact of droughts at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yield. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

6863667,"Improving The Efficiency Of Conservation Policies With The Use Of Surrogates Derived From Remotely Sensed And Ancillary Data","Conservation policies are emerging in many places around the world, many of which involve payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. PES schemes provide economic incentives for forgoing land uses that reduce the provision of ecosystem services. The efficiency of such schemes depends not only on the ecosystem services provided by an area but also on the willingness of local people to forgo their land use activities. Targeting land for enrollment in PES schemes on the basis of the potential provision of ecosystem services and on the willingness to forgo certain economic activities, may therefore improve the efficiency of these schemes. The objective of this study was to develop a targeting approach, based on three surrogates derived from remotely sensed and ancillary data, for identifying land to be enrolled in one of the largest PES schemes in the world: China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP). The GTGP encourages farmers to return steep hillside cropland to forest by providing cash, grain and tree seedlings. The three surrogates used in the targeting approach were slope index, cropland probability, and GTGP enrollment probability. Combining these surrogates through Bernoulli trials allows targeting areas under cropland, with low opportunity costs for farmers and with potentially high soil erosion and landslide susceptibility. Results of applying the targeting approach in a case study area (Baoxing County, Sichuan Province, China) show that around half of the land currently enrolled is placed in areas with gentle slopes and tend to be located distant from forest areas. This reduces the potential benefits obtained from the GTGP. Targeting land using the proposed approach may double the benefits obtained from the program under the same budget, thus improving its efficiency. The approach may be applied to the entire GTGP implementation area in China and with proper modifications it may also be applicable to similar PES programs around the world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

6863407,"A Review Of Applications Of Remote Sensing For Drought Studies In The Andes Region","Study region: As climate change intensifies, drought events are becoming more frequent and intense in the Andes region. Remote sensing offers new opportunities to characterize and monitor drought and its impacts for the benefit of disaster risk reduction, water governance, and climate change adaptation. However, it remains to be seen the extent to which remotely-sensed data has been integrated into the Andes regional drought literature. Study focus: Through a semi-systematic literature review, this study evaluates the existing literature in the Andes on the topic, assesses how, where, and the extent to which remote sensing is being deployed in drought studies in the region, and points to key gaps in our regional understanding of this topic of high societal and environmental concern. New hydrological insight for the region: Remote sensing applications in drought studies remain limited in the Andes but have grown substantially since 2020. The reviewed studies concentrate on Chile and offer new insight into the impact of drought on vegetation, water bodies, the cryosphere, and wildfire incidence. Human activity, through agricultural decision-making and other socioeconomic dimensions, plays a role in propagating or deepening drought in the region. This literature offers new insight into the interplay between different drought types and the role of remote sensing in social-environmental research, although further research across geographies and drought types in the Andes region is urgently needed. © 2023 The Authors","{""Altemus Cullen, K.""}","10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101483",2024-07-12 19:29:57,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",2023,"{}","{""Andes region"",Drought,""Remote sensing"",""Satellite imagery"",Social-environmental}"
6863435,"A Multiscalar Approach To Mapping Marginal Agricultural Land: Smallholder Agriculture In Malawi","Marginal agricultural lands are defined here by suboptimal biophysical conditions and historically variable or low agricultural production. We characterize these areas using remotely sensed information to disentangle the biophysical and possible social factors driving marginality. Considering both the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy problem, the heuristic we propose is generalizable across geographies and scales and provides information at multiple decision-making levels through a multiscalar interannual variability model. We present results from our study of Malawi, where the landscape is densely cultivated and smallholder farmers frequently occupy marginal lands, to illustrate the potential of a multiscalar analysis in a place where food insecurity alleviation is needed and where remote sensing can provide necessary information. Our framework for identifying marginal agricultural lands consists of (1) locating long-term agricultural land, (2) measuring interannual productivity of long-term farmed locations, and (3) assessing marginal biophysical land characteristics and the fundamental climate niche for the dominant crop (in this case maize). Productivity and marginality in Malawi are spatially organized, and an assessment of productivity at multiple scales highlights the importance of presenting both global and local spatiotemporal variability for managing agroecological variance. By disaggregating broad classes of historically marginal production and the underlying drivers of marginality, different intervention efforts can intelligently target areas most likely to receive maximum benefit. These methodologies can be applied by both policymakers and scholars to identify and target marginal agricultural areas for improved productivity and for the support of smallholder farmer livelihoods.","{""Messina, Joseph P."",""Peter, Brad G."",""Snapp, Sieglinde S.""}","10.1080/24694452.2017.1403877",2024-09-30 01:27:39,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""agriculture; development; marginal land; multiscalar; remote sensing""}"

The adaptive estimation system enables a fast reliable data prediction to replicate the missing or misleading data caused by malfunctions in the sensors or communication links, thereby compensating for the deficiency of data that can trigger fault diagnoses of engine health. The estimation method features the integration of an autoregression model and a self-tuning adaptation algorithm for one-step-ahead estimation, in which the manufacturer's baseline values are used as an input in conjunction with an adaptive input adjusted to minimize the estimate error deviated from the snapshot data taken from satellites. The entire system is implemented through the parameter identification and optimization in an attempt to minimize the estimate error. Stability of this adaptive estimation system is investigated, and discrete-time simulations of in-flight parameter estimation will also be presented to show the effectiveness of the present approach.",NA,"10.2514/2.2965",2024-10-01 17:22:06,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863033,"Biologically Important Areas Ii For Cetaceans Within Us And Adjacent Waters - Aleutian Islands And Bering Sea Region","We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetaceans in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This effort, the second led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for BIA II came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; whaling data, including stomach and fecal contents; prey studies; and genetics. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, the BIA II products incorporate a scoring and labeling system, which will improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. In the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region, a total of 19 BIAs were identified, delineated, and scored for seven species, including bowhead, North Pacific right, gray, humpback, fin, and sperm whales, and belugas. These include one hierarchical BIA for belugas that consists of one localized ""child"" BIA within an overarching ""parent"" BIA. There were 15 feeding, 3 migratory, and 1 small and resident population BIAs; no reproductive BIAs were identified. In some instances, information existed about a species' use of a particular area and time, but the information was insufficient to confidently delineate the candidate BIA; in those cases, the candidate BIA was added to a watch list. A total of 22 watch list areas were identified and delineated for 10 species, including all species mentioned above and minke whales, harbor porpoises, and Dall's porpoises. There were 15 feeding, 4 migratory, 2 reproductive, and 1 small and resident population watch list areas.

6863646,"Assessment Of The Value Of Remotely Sensed Surface Water Extent Data For The Calibration Of A Lumped Hydrological Model","For many catchments, there is insufficient field data to calibrate the hydrological models that are needed to answer water resources management questions. One way to overcome this lack of data is to use remotely sensed data. In this study, we assess whether Landsat-based surface water extent observations can inform the calibration of a lumped bucket-type model for Brazilian catchments. We first performed synthetic experiments with daily, monthly, and limited monthly data (April–October), assuming a perfect monotonic relation between streamflow and stream width. The median relative performance was 0.35 for daily data and 0.17 for monthly data, where values above 0 imply an improvement in model performance compared to the lower benchmark. This indicates that the limited temporal resolution of remotely sensed data is not an impediment for model calibration. In a second step, we used real remotely sensed water extent data for calibration. For only 76 of the 671 sites the remotely sensed water extent was large and variable enough to be used for model calibration. For 30% of these sites, calibration with the actual remotely sensed water extent data led to a model fit that was better than the lower benchmark (i.e., relative performance >0). Model performance increased with river width and variation therein. This indicates that the coarse spatial resolution of the freely-available, long time series of water extent used in this study hampered model calibration. We, therefore, expect that newer higher-resolution imagery will be helpful for model calibration for more sites, especially when time series length increases. © 2023.

In present study an attempted has been made to analyze characterization and prioritization of sub-watersheds in upper basin of Rihand watershed based on hydro-morphometric parameters, in an environment of Geographical Information System (GIS), with the help of Multicriteria Decision Making through Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) techniques in order to identify critical sub-watersheds for conservation and management of soil and water resource. The morphometric characterization has been done through measurement of linear, areal and relief aspect of over seven sub-watersheds using SOI topographical sheet and SRTM data with the help of Q GIS 3.10 and White box software. In the purpose prioritization of sub-watersheds FAHP method has been implemented through assigning fuzzy membership function to each of 15 morphometric parameters by deriving their relationships with erosional hazard and criterion weight has been obtained using Saaty's (Fundamentals of decision making and priority theory with analytical hierarchical process, RWS Publications University of Pittsburgh, Pittusburgh, 1980) proposed method. Based on prioritization approach the entire sub-watershed has divided into 3 vulnerable zones, i.e., high, medium and low. This study reveals that about 29\% area of the watershed is falls under high vulnerable zone as they obtained high priority value and required immediate measures.

6862879,"Effects Of Vegetation Restoration On Soil Conservation And Sediment Loads In China: A Critical Review","China has been one of the countries suffering from the most serious soil erosion, which has severely degraded soil productivity and water quality, thus affecting agricultural activities and hindering economic and social development. During the past few decades, a large amount of effort has been made to combat soil erosion. Vegetation restoration as a major strategy is given equal importance compared to engineering measures. Although a measure of success has been achieved, many uncertainties remain unanswered such as to what extent the vegetation restoration has reduced soil erosion and sediment loads especially in large river systems. This paper first analyzes the impacts of vegetation restoration on soil erosion and sediment loads in terms of vegetation cover and vegetation species. Then, the spatial scale effect of soil erosion reduction benefit resulting from vegetation restoration is elaborated. Soil erosion reduction benefit decreases with increased vegetation planting area. In addition, a comprehensive discussion about the disputes between vegetation restoration and engineering measures is made by integrating published studies spanning large spatial and temporal scales. Finally, future research needs regarding vegetation restoration efforts are given. In order to evaluate the effects of vegetation restoration programs on soil erosion, assessments in shorter time interval and larger spatial scale should be undertaken. Further, the present assessment system mainly based on simple statistical methods has to be improved. Specific areas demanding immediate attention, including the western China in general and the upper Yangtze River basin in particular, are highlighted as well.

6668444,"Oasis Land-Use Change And Its Effects On The Eco-Environment In Yanqi Basin, Xinjiang, China","Satellite data and the published coefficients about the world's and China's ecosystem were used to analyze the effects of land-use changes on the ecosystem service in the Yanqi Basin. Both economic developments and arid, fragile ecosystems have strongly affected the land use. A sensitivity analysis determined the effect of manipulating the coefficients on the estimated values.

6691605,"The Economic Value of Seasonal Forecasts: Stochastic Economywide Analysis for East Africa","There is growing interest within the climate change and development community in using seasonal forecast information to reduce the losses to agriculture resulting from climate variability, especially within food-insecure countries. However, forecast systems are expensive to establish and maintain, and therefore, gauging the potential economic return to investments in forecast systems is crucial. Most studies that evaluate seasonal forecasts focus on developed countries and/or overlook agriculture’s economywide linkages. Yet forecasts may be more valuable in developing regions such as East Africa, where climate is variable and agriculture has macroeconomic importance. We use computable general equilibrium and process-based crop models to estimate the potential economywide value of national seasonal forecast systems in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Stochastic seasonal simulations produce value distributions for forecasts of varying accuracy and varying levels of farm coverage. A timely and accurate forecast adopted by all farmers generates average regional income gains of US$113 million per year. Gains are much higher during extreme climate events and are generally pro-poor. The forecast value falls when forecast skill and farm coverage decline. National economic and trading structures, including the importance of agricultural exports, are found to be major determinants of forecast value. Economywide approaches are therefore needed to complement farm-level analysis when evaluating forecast systems in low-income agrarian economies.","{""Rodrigues, Joao""}","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2820148",2024-04-26 19:17:25,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2016,"{}","{""economic value|general equilibrium|seasonal forecasts|stochastic modeling|Africa""}"

However, applying herbicide only where needed could have economical and environmental benefits. The objective of this study was to apply remote sensing to the detection of grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal and broadleaf crops. Spectral relative reflectance values at both leaf and canopy scales were obtained by field spectroscopy for four plant categories: wheat, chickpea, grass weeds, and broadleaf weeds. Total reflectance spectra of leaf tissues for botanical genera were successfully classified by general discriminant analysis (GDA). The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 +/- 4.19\% for wheat and 94 +/- 5.13\% for chickpea. The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for future Vegetation and Environmental Monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENS) bands was 77 +/- 8.09\% for wheat and 88 +/- 6.94\% for chickpea, and for the operative satellite Advanced Land Imager (ALI) bands was 78 +/- 7.97\% for wheat and 82 +/- 8.22\% for chickpea. Within the critical period for weed control, an overall classification accuracy of 87 +/- 5.57\% was achieved for >5\% vegetation coverage in a wheat field, thereby providing potential for implementation of herbicide applications.

6903564,"Spatial Analysis Of Early Mangrove Regeneration In The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, Using Geomatics","Successful mangrove tree regeneration is required to maintain the provision of wood for silviculturally managed mangrove forest areas and to ensure mangrove rehabilitation in disturbed areas. Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118213",2024-10-03 22:03:00,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863325,"Mechanisms Of Group-Hunting In Vertebrates","Group-hunting is ubiquitous across animal taxa and has received considerable attention in the context of its functions. By contrast much less is known about the mechanisms by which grouping predators hunt their prey. This is primarily due to a lack of experimental manipulation alongside logistical difficulties quantifying the behaviour of multiple predators at high spatiotemporal resolution as they search, select, and capture wild prey. However, the use of new remote-sensing technologies and a broadening of the focal taxa beyond apex predators provides researchers with a great opportunity to discern accurately how multiple predators hunt together and not just whether doing so provides hunters with a per capita benefit. We incorporate many ideas from collective behaviour and locomotion throughout this review to make testable predictions for future researchers and pay particular attention to the role that computer simulation can play in a feedback loop with empirical data collection. Our review of the literature showed that the breadth of predator:prey size ratios among the taxa that can be considered to hunt as a group is very large (10(2)). We therefore synthesised the literature with respect to these predator:prey ratios and found that they promoted different hunting mechanisms. Additionally, these different hunting mechanisms are also related to particular stages of the hunt (search, selection, capture) and thus we structure our review in accordance with these two factors (stage of the hunt and predator:prey size ratio). We identify several novel group-hunting mechanisms which are largely untested, particularly under field conditions, and we also highlight a range of potential study organisms that are amenable to experimental testing of these mechanisms in connection with tracking technology. We believe that a combination of new hypotheses, study systems and methodological approaches should help push the field of group-hunting in new directions.","{""Bartashevich, Palina"",""Burns, Alicia"",""Domenici, Paolo"",""Hansen, Matthew J."",""Krause, Jens""}","10.1111/brv.12973",2024-10-03 17:46:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",""Review or opinion""}",2023,"{}","{""decision-making; social information transfer; herding; simulation; remote sensing; pursuit"",""group-hunting; predator; prey size ratios; attack behaviour; stages of the hunt; collective behaviou""}"
6863333,"Changes In Land-Use And Ecosystem Service Value In Guangdong Province, Southern China, From 1990 To 2018","Land-use/cover is one of the major factors that affect the ecosystem and the services it provides. The impact of land-use change on ecosystem service value is a hotspot in developing countries, especially China-a region with rapid economic development and rapid population growth. As the leading area of China's reform and opening-up, Guangdong province in southern China is subjected to land-use conversion that significantly alters the capacity of natural ecosystem to provide ecosystem services supporting human well-being. We analyzed the characteristics of land-use changes from 1990 to 2018 using the four-phase land-use data interpreted from Landsat satellite images. We estimated the ecosystem service value through a well-established benefit transfer method using modified local value coefficients, analyzed the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services through ecosystem service trade-off degree, and compared the relationship between ecosystem services value, economic development, and population in Guangdong province. The results indicated that the following: (1) Built-Up Area drastically expanded from 6783.1 km(2) in 1990 to 13,142.0 km(2) in 2018 (93.7\%), especially in the Pearl River Delta, where the growth rate of Built-Up Area expansion was up to 169.0\%. The other land-use types were all contracted as Cropland (-10.9\%), Forestland (-1.0\%), Grassland (-4.0\%), Water Body (-2.1\%), and Unused Land (-24.4\%). (2) Total ecosystem service value decreased from US\$121,666 billion in 1990 to US\$116,432 billion in 2018 (-4.3\%). Cropland, Forestland, and Water Body played the most important roles for the total ecosystem service value. Water supply experienced the largest declines in ecosystem services value (US\$ -1866.3 million, -10.1\%), followed by waste treatment (7.6\%) and gas regulation (-4.9\%). (3) Synergy was the dominant relationship among ecosystem services. The above results can not only serve as reference case for other provinces/regions/countries/ to carry out relevant research work but also provide much focus on land-use planning to manage the impacts of land-use change on regional ecosystem services function.","{""Bai, Hui"",""Wang, Ting"",""Wang, Xuan"",""Ye, Yanqiong"",""Zhang, Jiaen"",""Zhao, Wei""}","10.3390/land10040426",2024-07-12 19:38:28,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""land-use change; ecosystem service value; trade-off"",""synergy; Guangdong province; Southern China""}"

We find that if an optimal control policy is used under uncertainty, the eventual resolution of uncertainty has high value relative to current research budgets, and resolving uncertainty about the costs of warming is nearly as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming. In addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resolution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program. On the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertainty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty, the benefit of early resolution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater.","{""Peck, Stephen""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/0928-7655(93)90019-Q",2024-04-26 22:56:26,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",1993,"{}",NA

Specifically, we analysed and extended the current understanding of the topic by focusing on the concepts of technology adoption and well-being. The data were sourced from 30 papers that were selected based on specific criteria from the WoS and Scopus databases. They were acquired through a systematic search and quality appraisal process. The adopted technology can be grouped into sustainable agricultural practices and innovations, digital agriculture and information technology, precision farming and resource management, financial inclusion and agricultural transactions, remote sensing and satellite technology, and agricultural programs and initiatives. Most papers indicated that technology adoption improved farmers' well-being which was basically measured using productivity and income. The measure however lacked farmers' value judgments, such as happiness. Agricultural technology could have a mixed effect on farmers' well-being, depending on the type of technology adopted and the compatibility of farmers with technology in their agricultural practices. This study will assist researchers in developing an appropriate framework and strategy to improve farmers' welfare, which can alleviate poverty. These may further help policymakers identify the best technological innovations that can improve farmers' economic and social welfare, thereby facilitating the development of plans to meet farmers’ needs and interests. Finally, the study suggested future research directions for researchers and academics. © 2024",NA,"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24316",2024-09-26 00:47:44,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863174,"An Integrated Approach To Trophic Assessment Of Coastal Waters Incorporating Measurement, Modelling And Water Quality Classification","Various protocols have been developed for trophic assessment of coastal waters but most incorporate single value compliance criteria for water quality parameters which, in reality, exhibit significant spatial variation. Application of these protocols generally requires the averaging of data recorded at discrete locations to obtain single values for comparison with compliance criteria; however, there is no guarantee that the averaged values are truly representative of overall water quality. The present approach to trophic assessment integrates measurement, remote sensing, flushing analysis and water quality modelling with the aim of identifying sub-regions in coastal waterbodies that demonstrate homogeneity. Averaged water quality data for these homogenous sub-regions should be more representative of the water quality in the sub-region as a whole making the assessment process more accurate. The integrated approach incorporates water quality classification criteria developed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency but it can incorporate any suitable classification criteria. The approach was validated for a sub-region of Cork Harbour, Ireland and the trophic assessments agreed with previous assessments by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The approach has significant applications in the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and was adopted by the Irish EPA in convincing the EU to provide the Irish government with structural funds for water quality management within Cork Harbour.

The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Methods: Bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N = 86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. Results: A total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Main conclusions: Expansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","{""Ault, J.

GWIM was developed and promoted by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) through global partnerships to investigate wetland analyses at multiple scales. The present study investigates the complexity of an inland freshwater wetland system, presenting a conceptual framework for mapping and monitoring the dynamics of Lake Kolleru (a wetland of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention), utilizing a geospatial platform. Illustrating the pace of land use changes leading to the progressive elimination of the wetland ecosystem of freshwater Lake Kolleru, this study also highlights the impacts of such changes on the socio-economic system. A comprehensive temporal analysis (1977–2007) provided a structural base to schematically analyse the dynamics of biophysical and ecological changes to the wetland by effectively using a spectrum of remote sensing data. The present status and changing trends in ecological dimensions of Lake Kolleru were illustrated, utilizing information from spatial analyses, complimented with socio-economic assessment. Attention is drawn to the potential of utilizing earth resources systems in exploring space–time interactions in freshwater ecosystems heavily modified through aquaculture interventions. Further, the spatial derivatives are meant as reference material for local authorities and decision-makers to rehabilitate the economic livelihood activities to the social community dependent on the lake ecosystem.

6903502,"Constraints Of Grassland Science, Pastoral Management And Policy In Northern China: Anthropological Perspectives On Degradational Narratives","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the implications of policies, practices and new “non-equilibrium” management approaches in mobile grassland management. Design/methodology/approach – The author takes an actor-oriented perspective on the narrative of land-use practices, notional sustainable stocking rates and the problematic of state policy interventions in local context. The paper is based on two years in the field on a bilateral aid-funded grassland management project at Xing'an League, Inner Mongolia and follow-up among selected informants. Findings – The constitution of grasslands “degradation” is in fact contested by resource users. Most grassland scientists, Party and Government officials in China have tended to associate ethnic “minority” mobile pastoralists with destructive cultural practices that, they argue, have led to ecological decline on the steppes. This argument is integral to the “degradation narrative” that underpins the discourse on grassland science. The conventional bio-ecology emphasis on species dominance (growth-form), in fact says little about the extent of anthropogenic impacts on above-ground biomass and whether these factors have been the cause of degradation. The paper suggests that greater consideration is given to specific changes in human activity, climatic and plant productivity over time and space, based on endogenous, flexible seasonal estimates. Research limitations/implications – Although presenting challenges to conventional grassland science based on endogenous experiences and herder practices, it may have specific geopolitical limits to more general scaling-up in different contexts. Practical implications – The paper discusses new modalities of non-equilibrium grassland management, inverting normative top-down approaches to controlling environmental degradation, livestock distribution and stocking rates. Social implications – The paper suggests rethinking the use of customary practices, vernacular knowledge and the social organisation of herders in the design of sustainable grassland management. Originality/value – The paper may be valuable to practitioners, rural development planners, funders and researchers interested in the use of integrated, cross-disciplinary, new ecological knowledge in grassland management. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",NA,"10.1108/14468951211262251",2024-09-26 00:49:16,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

This work aims to develop statistical forecasting of seasonal total water storage (TWS) anomalies in Ethiopia using sea-surface temperature and sea-level pressure indices. Because of the spatial and temporal variability of TWS over the country, Ethiopia is divided into four regions each having similar TWS dynamics. Periods of long-term water deficit observed in GRACE TWS products for the region are found to coincide with periods of meteorological drought. Multiple linear regression is employed to generate seasonal forecasting models for each region. We find that the skill of the resulting models varies from region to region, withR(2)from 0.33 to 0.73 and correlation from 0.27 to 0.77 between predicted and observed values (using leave-one-out cross-validation).

6862758,"Can Global Precipitation Datasets Benefit The Estimation Of The Area To Be Cropped In Irrigated Agriculture?","The area to be cropped in irrigation districts needs to be planned according to the available water resources to avoid agricultural production loss. However, the period of record of local hydro-meteorological data may be short, leading to an incomplete understanding of climate variability and consequent uncertainty in estimating surface water availability for irrigation area planning. In this study we assess the benefit of using global precipitation datasets to improve surface water availability estimates. A reference area that can be irrigated is established using a complete record of 30 years of observed river discharge data. Areas are then determined using simulated river discharges from six local hydrological models forced with in situ and global precipitation datasets (CHIRPS and MSWEP), each calibrated independently with a sample of 5 years extracted from the full 30-year record. The utility of establishing the irrigated area based on simulated river discharge simulations is compared against the reference area through a pooled relative utility value (PRUV). Results show that for all river discharge simulations the benefit of choosing the irrigated area based on the 30 years of simulated data is higher compared to using only 5 years of observed discharge data, as the statistical spread of PRUV using 30 years is smaller. Hence, it is more beneficial to calibrate a hydrological model using 5 years of observed river discharge and then to extend it with global precipitation data of 30 years as this weighs up against the model uncertainty of the model calibration.","{""Karimi, Poolad"",""Kaune, Alexander"",""Lopez, Patricia Lopez"",""Rodriguez, Erasmo"",""Werner, Micha"",""de Fraiture, Charlotte""}","10.5194/hess-23-2351-2019",2024-07-19 23:53:15,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{maybe}",NA
6863046,"From Bamako To Kolda: A Case Study Of Medicines And The Financing Of District Health Services","In 1987 the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization promoted the Bamako Initiative whose principal objective was to raise funds for primary health care (PHC) at community level through charging for drug treatment. Although the $US 180 million requested from donors by UNICEF has not been forthcoming, nevertheless about 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are at present implementing Bamako-type projects. The management of these projects may perhaps benefit from experience in the district of Kolda in Senegal, a country in which the principle of the self-management of receipts by health service structures has been established since 1981.In 1985, in the rural district (departement) of Kolda, Senegal, situated 450 km from Dakar, the health service was not being used by the population. The district management team attempted to change the pattern of under-utilization by rationalizing the mechanisms for financing services and supplies of pharmaceuticals.

6903590,"Geolocation Of Free-Ranging Fish On The European Continental Shelf As Determined From Environmental Variables - I. Tidal Location Method","Demersal fish cannot readily be tracked using satellite-based or light-based geolocation techniques. As an alternative, we describe the tidal location method, which uses tidal data recorded by electronic data storage tags (DSTs), to determine geoposition. Times of high water (H) and tidal ranges (R) recorded by DSTs moored at known locations, and from free-swimming tagged plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, were compared with a North Sea tidal database to identify all positions with matching values of H and R. Within the recording precision of the tag (+/-0.2 m, +/-10 min) and the predicted accuracy of the model generated tidal data (+/-0.15 m, +/-20 min), geolocations over much of the North Sea and eastern English Channel were predicted to be accurate to within 40 kin, sometimes to within 10 km. Positional estimates of the moored tags were within 15.7+/-3.5 km of the actual locations. Geolocations made from tagged plaice within 5 days of release and 5 days pre-recapture were within 35+/-24 km and 37+/-23 km of release and recapture positions respectively. Our results demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately describe the migrations of North Sea plaice throughout their geographical range with a level of accuracy unattainable using light-based geolocation. The method could equally be applied to any shelf-dwelling demersal fish that periodically rests on the sea-bed for the duration of a tidal cycle. In fisheries management, the method has clear potential application in defining the movements and migrations of other commercial species.",NA,"10.1007/s00227-002-0984-5",2024-10-01 17:51:29,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6447811,"Opportunities for Increasing the Impact of NASA’s Earth Observations along Environmental Justice Dimensions","Environmental justice (EJ) is an important social priority and has become a policy goal at the federal level. Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, requires all federal agencies to develop programs, policies, and activities to address the disproportionately high adverse environmental impacts faced by marginalized communities. This raises the question of how NASA can increase the impact of its scientific outputs along EJ dimensions. How can the agency’s existing data products be leveraged to enable progress on EJ-related questions? What new scientific information can NASA produce to help reduce environmental inequities? Many of NASA’s earth observations (EOs) offer complete geographic coverage and thus have strong potential to help systematically quantify the unequal burden of environmental harm and promote the equal enforcement of environmental law. For example, this report shows that using satellite-derived measures for monitoring compliance with environmental regulations could have potentially large equity implications. But despite recent efforts to increase the use of satellite data for such policy applications, satellite resources remain largely underutilized. While state and federal agencies are increasingly turning to satellite data for EJ research studies, these results often fall short of influencing decisionmaking (Holloway and Bratburd 2021). Barriers to use for EOs include difficulty in handling the native observations, a lack of trust in the accuracy of the data, and incompatibility of satellite-derived measures with legal compliance monitoring requirements (Prados et al. 2021). Produced as part of the VALUABLES Consortium, this paper aims to outline ways that NASA can use its data products to promote EJ and overcome the barriers faced in the use of satellite data to influence decisionmaking. Importantly, the set of recommendations provided here is not intended to substitute for NASA’s direct engagement with EJ communities to learn what would be of most value to them, but rather is meant to complement these efforts by providing a perspective from the environmental policy community. Specifically, the insights that this perspective can provide are based on environmental policy scholars’ understanding of how scientific information, including remotely sensed information, plays a role in the formation of policy within a variety of economic, political, and social contexts. In addition, the recommendations here are informed by the literature on policy evaluation and knowledge of which kinds of policies have proven to be more effective than others, including those with EJ dimensions. This report focuses on four broad categories of opportunities for promoting EJ: 1. leveraging EOs to reduce the inequitable burden of environmental harm 2. making NASA’s data products more accessible to EJ communities 3. developing new sensors and missions to fill EJ data gaps 4. contributing to the development of quantifiable metrics to measure progress toward EJ goals. This set of recommendations builds on existing efforts at NASA to increase the impact of satellite data along EJ dimensions. In particular, NASA’s Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (HAQAST) has a Tiger Team tasked with leveraging satellite data for EJ. HAQAST members are working with public stakeholders to identify communities disproportionately affected by environmental health risks, build capacity among EJ communities for using and interpreting satellite data sets, and increase the accessibility of satellite data for EJ applications. Additionally, in 2021, NASA announced a new funding opportunity providing an estimated $3 million in awards to advance progress on EJ domestically through the application of earth science, geospatial, and socioeconomic information. The aim of this document is to reinforce the need for this type of work at NASA and identify additional opportunities for advancing EJ using agency resources.","{""Druckenmiller, Hannah""}",NA,NA,NA,NA,2023,"{}",NA
6863692,"An Integrated Method To Create Habitat Suitability Models For Fragmented Landscapes","Given the pervasive influence of human induced habitat fragmentation in ecological processes, landscape models are a welcome advance. The development of GIS software has allowed a greater use of these models and of analyses of the relationship between species and habitat variables. Habitat suitability models are thus theoretical concepts that can be used for planning in fragmented landscapes and habitat conservation. The most commonly used models are based on single species and on the assignment of suitability values for some environmental variables. Generally the cartographic basis for modeling suitability are thematic maps produced by a Boolean logic. In this paper we propose a model based on a set of focal species and on maps produced by a fuzzy classification method. Focal species, selected by an expert-based approach, provide a practical way of extending the scope of habitat suitability models to the conservation of biodiversity at landscape scale. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion may allow more consideration of the connectivity of an area because it allows a better detection of ecological gradients within a landscape. We applied this methodology to the Tuscany region focusing on terrestrial mammals. Performing a fuzzy classification we produced five land cover maps and through image processing operations we obtained a suitability model which applies a continuity criterion. The resulting suitability fuzzy model seems better for the study of connectivity and fragmentation, especially in areas with high spatial complexity. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

6863346,"Brazil's Amazon Soy Moratorium Reduced Deforestation","Between 2004 and 2012, multiple policies contributed to one of the great conservation successes of the twenty-first century-an 84\% decrease in the rate of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring. Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.","{""Gibbs, Holly K."",""Heilmayr, Robert"",""Munger, Jacob"",""Rausch, Lisa L.""}","10.1038/s43016-020-00194-5",2024-07-18 22:36:57,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}",NA
6862827,"Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Changes Of Ecological Environment Quality And Its Coupling Coordination With Urbanization In The Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, China","It is inevitable that urban agglomeration will have a coercive impact on the regional Ecological Environment Quality (EEQ) as a consequence of high-speed urbanization. Balancing the EEQ and urbanization development has become a problem worthy of attention. In order to objectively evaluate the EEQ of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) and explore the impact of the urbanization process on it, this paper is based on the Modified Remote Sensing Ecological Index (MRSEI) and the Comprehensive Night Light Index (CNLI), respectively, and conducts a quantitative assessment of the YRDUA in China from 2000 to 2020. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the MRSEI of the YRDUA first decreased and then increased, and the ecological environment quality degraded first and then improved; however, there were significant differences between regions. The ecological environment quality in the south is obviously better than that in the north, and the ecological environment quality in the north changes more drastically, and the low value area of MRSEI will gradually move downstream as time changes; (2) During the study period, the YRDUA formed a hierarchical and progressive urbanization pattern. The inland urbanization process expanded from east to west along the Yangtze River, and the urbanization process of coastal cities expanded from Shanghai as the center to the north and south with high-intensity urbanization cities concentrated in Shanghai and its surrounding cities and low-intensity urbanization cities distributed in the western part of the urban agglomeration; (3) The Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) between urbanization and EEQ in the YRDUA has continuously improved with an increase of 28.57\% in the past 21 years, and the number of cities with high level coupling continues to rise, while the number of medium level coupling cities and low level coupling cities has declined. As a large-scale and long-term analysis of changes in the EEQ and the urbanization process, this study can provide theoretical support for policymakers to formulate mesoscale development planning, EEQ monitoring, and environmental protection policies.","{""Shi, Zhiyu"",""Wang, Yating"",""Zhao, Qing""}","10.3390/ijerph20021627",2024-10-03 20:53:43,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""eco-environment quality; Google Earth Engine; spatiotemporal variation; MRSEI; urbanization; the Yan""}"

The present study focuses on deriving the LST of Raipur City and generating the relationship between LST and some land surface indices, like NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, NMDI, and NDBaI for better land-use planning and environmental management inside the city. These land surface indices respond in different ways with the changes of LST in an urban landscape. There are only a few numbers of research works available on the relationship of LST and land surface indices in a tropical city for pre-monsoon season. The present study has been performed on a total of fifteen multi-date Landsat data sets of the pre-monsoon season from 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. The mono-window algorithm has been applied in retrieving the LST. Results show that LST builds a positive relation with NDBI, NDBaI, and NDWI and a negative relation with NDVI and NMDI. These relationships are stronger in the area below mean LST (low LST zones) and weaker in the area above mean LST (high LST zones).

6863529,"Landsat-Based Monitoring Of Southern Pine Beetle Infestation Severity And Severity Change In A Temperate Mixed Forest","The recent northward expansion of Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) outbreaks associated with warming winters has caused extensive tree mortality in temperate pine forests, significantly affecting forest dynamics, structure, and functioning. Spatially-explicit early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality is critical for timely and sustainable forest management practices. The unique contributions of remote sensing technologies to mapping the location, extent, and severity of beetle outbreaks, as well as assisting in analyzing the potential drivers for outbreak predictions, have been well recognized. However, little is known about the performance of moderate resolution satellite multispectral imagery for early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality. Thus, we conducted this study, as the first attempt, to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of SPB infestation severity at the regional scale and to understand the underlying environmental drivers in a spatially-explicit manner. First, we explored the spectral signatures of SPB-killed trees based on 30-m plot measurements and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, to improve detection accuracy for areas with low-moderate SPB infestation severity, we added spectraltemporal anomaly information in the form of a linear trend of the spectral index trajectory to a previously developed approach. The best overall accuracy increased from 84.7\% to 90.1\% and the best Macro F1 value increased from 0.832 to 0.900. Next, we compared the performances of spectral indices in mapping SPB infestation severity (i.e., \% red stage within the 30-m grid cell). The results showed that the combination of Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness had the best performance for mapping SPB infestation severity (2016: R2 = 0.754; RSME = 15.7; 2017: R2 = 0.787; RSME = 12.4). Finally, we found that climatic and landscape variables can explain the detected patterns of SPB infestation from 2014 to 2017 in our study area (R2 = 0.751; RSME = 9.67), providing valuable insights on possible predictors for early warning of SPB infestation. Specifically, in our study area, winter dew point temperature was found to be one of the most important predictors, followed by SPB infestation locations in the previous year, canopy cover of host species, elevation, and slope. In the context of continued global warming, our study not only provides a novel framework for efficient, spatially-explicit, and quantitative measurements of forest damage induced by SPB infestation over large scales, but also uncovers opportunities to predict future SPB outbreaks and take precautions against it.","{""Gao, Renjie"",""Huang, Chengquan"",""Huang, Zehua"",""Lv, Zhengang"",""Meng, Ran"",""Sun, Rui"",""Zhao, Feng""}","10.1016/j.rse.2021.112847",2024-07-17 21:54:42,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{calibration}","{""Forest health; Plant diseases"",""pests; Multi-scale remote sensing; Forest management; Early warning; Climate-smart forestry; Outbrea""}"

It has been shown that texture can be used instead of the usual sigma(0)/age relationships at P-band to retrieve plantation forest parameters, but the analysis of sigma(0) spatial characteristics has not been fully explored. The aim of this letter is to investigate the relationships between stand age (which is correlated to forest variables) and texture descriptors calculated from statistics generated by the gray-level co-occurrence matrix for varying distance d, and orientation alpha, values used to calculate the matrix. Synthetic aperture radar images are P-band airborne data acquired by the ONERA RAMSES instrument over a controlled homogeneous test site located in the Landes region, France. It is found that texture descriptors contrast, inverse difference moment, homogeneity, and correlation are strongly influenced by the parameters (d, alpha) related to forest stand structure (forest rows, stand density) and image resolution. In contrast, energy and entropy are observed to be highly correlated to stand age and displayed a stable performance whatever the distance and orientation parameters (d, alpha), thus rendering them a good contender as an alternative to the usual sigma(0) based relationships applied to this type of forest.","{""Alborini, Arnaud"",""Champion, Isabelle"",""Da Costa, Jean Pierre"",""Dubois-Fernandez, Pascale"",""Germain, Christian""}","10.1109/lgrs.2013.2244060",2024-09-30 17:33:37,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2014,"{}","{""Biomass; forestry; image texture analysis; radar applications; remote sensing; synthetic aperture ra""}"

This paper presents new evidence about the local effects of strictly protected areas in Thailand, combining data on socioeconomic outcomes from a poverty mapping study with satellite-based estimates of forest cover. The selective placement of protected areas is addressed by controlling for characteristics which drove both protection and development and by instrumenting for protection with priority watershed status. The estimates indicate that protected areas increased average consumption and lowered poverty rates, despite imposing binding constraints on agricultural land availability. Socioeconomic gains are likely explained by increased tourism in and around protected areas. However, net impacts are largest at intermediate distances from major cities, highlighting that the spatial patterns of both costs and benefits are important for efforts to minimize conservation-development tradeoffs.

6903595,"Research Progress On Trade-Offs And Synergies Of Ecosystem Services: An Overview","Being the core of ecosystem assessment, studies on ecosystem services have been becoming a focus in the field of ecology. The formation and provisioning capacity of ecosystem services are tremendously affected by human activities. Conversely, the magnitudes of ecosystem service changes also influence the preferences of human being's daily decision- making. Investigation into the dynamics of the trade-offs and synergistic relationships of regional ecosystem services will shed light on interactions and feedbacks between ecosystem services and the stakeholders at different spatial and temporal scales, and avoid double-counting issue in ecosystem services assessment. In addition, information and progress on trade- offs and synergies in the delivery of ecosystem services will provide scientific basis for designing and implementing eco- compensation schemes and optimize the management behavior of ecosystem services, and finally improve human well-being associated with trade-offs and synergies among different ecosystem services. It is revealed from this review that in the last decades, the valuation of ecosystem services has been received lots of attentions in the decision-making and scientific research communities. However, the double-counting issue during the valuation process usually leads to insufficient or biased guidance in the management of ecosystem services. Since ecosystem service is benefit that human receives from the natural ecosystems, the stakeholders' demand for ecosystem services from different spatial and temporal scales often causes competitions and conflicts among ecosystem's various goods and services. The interactions between human being and ecosystem services often give rise to trade-offs and synergies which in turn directly affect human welfare. With regard to the terminologies, trade-offs between ecosystem services refers to the enhancement of one ecosystem service locally in a short term is at the cost of other ecosystem services locally or at a large spatial scale (e. g., globally) in the future. It can be simplified as the ""win-lose"" mode. The term synergies means the synchronous changes between two or among many different ecosystem services, including the ""win-win"" mode and the ""lose-lose"" mode. The trade-offs and synergistic relationships exist not only within different categories of provisioning services, but also among different ecosystem services and like provision services, regulation services, cultural services, and supporting services. Findings from about 12 literatures has shown specific examples of such kind of trade-offs and synergistic relations, for instance, among provisioning services, between regulating services and cultural services, between provisioning services and supporting services, among regulating services, and between provisioning services and regulating services. The spatial scale of trade-offs and synergies contain various scales, for instance, from ecological scale to institutional scale. The temporal scale could be short-term to long-term based. This paper indicates that so far, trade-offs and synergies analysis of ecosystem services is still at its early stage. However, we identified and summarized two research approaches which have already been commonly used for the analysis of ecosystem services' trade-offs: (1) the Integrated Ecological-Economic Model: it is a traditional approach which is often used to quantify trade-offs. The Model consists of several ecological and economic models. The ecological models are mostly used to analyze the magnitudes of the changes of ecosystem services, while the economic models to evaluate the impacts of the change on human welfare. Since land use and land cover change serves as a direct driving factor of the ecosystem services' trade-offs and synergies, it will become even more extensive due to intensification of interactions between the two in the future. (2) Scenarios Analysis based on Landuse is attracting more and more attention in scientific literature. Remote sensing data and management policies of ecosystem services provd strong data basis for the scenarios formulation and analysis. It could provide more objective and spatially-explicit information on the trade-offs and synergies for optimizing ecosystem services management.",NA,"10.5846/stxb201109161360",2024-09-26 00:46:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",""Review or opinion""}",NA,"{}",NA

6691621,"Reviewing innovative Earth observation solutions for filling science-policy gaps in hydrology","Improved data sharing is needed for hydrological modeling and water management that require better integration of data, information and models. Technological advances in Earth observation and Web technologies have allowed the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) for improved data sharing at various scales. International initiatives catalyze data sharing by promoting interoperability standards to maximize the use of data and by supporting easy access to and utilization of geospatial data. A series of recent European projects are contributing to the promotion of innovative Earth observation solutions and the uptake of scientific outcomes in policy. Several success stories involving different hydrologists’ communities can be reported around the World. Gaps still exist in hydrological, agricultural, meteorological and climatological data access because of various issues. While many sources of data exists at all scales it remains difficult and time-consuming to assemble hydrological information for most projects. Furthermore, data and sharing formats remain very heterogeneous. Improvements require implementing/endorsing some commonly agreed standards and documenting data with adequate metadata. The brokering approach allows binding heterogeneous resources published by different data providers and adapting them to tools and interfaces commonly used by consumers of these resources. The challenge is to provide decision-makers with reliable information, based on integrated data and tools derived from both Earth observations and scientific models. Successful SDIs rely therefore on various aspects: a shared vision between all participants, necessity to solve a common problem, adequate data policies, incentives, and sufficient resources. New data streams from remote sensing or crowd sourcing are also producing valuable information to improve our understanding of the water cycle, while field sensors are developing rapidly and becoming less costly. More recent data standards are enhancing interoperability between hydrology and other scientific disciplines, while solutions exist to communicate uncertainty of data and models, which is an essential pre-requisite for decision-making. Distributed computing infrastructures can handle complex and large hydrological data and models, while Web Processing Services bring the flexibility to develop and execute simple to complex workflows over the Internet. The need for capacity building at human, infrastructure and institutional levels is also a major driver for reinforcing the commitment to SDI concepts.","{""Lehmann, Anthony""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.05.059",2024-04-23 22:23:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{""Hydrological modeling|Climate change|Data sharing|Interoperability|Data processing|Decision making""}"
6863460,"Monitoring Restored Tropical Forest Diversity And Structure Through Uav-Borne Hyperspectral And Lidar Fusion","Remote sensors, onboard orbital platforms, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance our understanding of changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function of forests, offering multi-scale monitoring of forest restoration. UAV systems can generate high-resolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data—canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAI—and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data—15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration. The use of UAV-borne remote sensors can play an essential role during the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, which requires detailed forest monitoring on an unprecedented scale. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","{""Almeida, D.

6863134,"The Temporal Variation Of Sediment Connectivity From 1982 To 2020 In The Wei River Basin, China","Sediment connectivity is a valuable metric that characterizes the relationship between sediment transport from the source to the sink, and the ease of sediment erosion. Over the past four decades, changes in land use types and vegetation cover have significantly altered sediment dynamics in the Wei River basin. In this study, we used the index of connectivity (IC) to assess the temporal changes in sediment connectivity at a watershed scale. We employed Landsat images to analyse the relationship between changes in vegetation cover or land use type and sediment connectivity. We used factor detector and interaction detector in Geodetector to analyse the importance and impact of vegetation and slope on IC changes. We assessed the correlation of sediment yield and connectivity to validate our results and it shows that IC has strong or moderate positive correlation with sediment yield from eight out of nine stations in the Wei River Basin. Our findings demonstrate that soil and water conservation measures, as well as the grain for green project, have led to the transformation of cropland and grassland into woodland. This change is reflected in the decrease of the maximum IC value from 6.24 to 5.72 in the Beiluo sub-basin, indicating a decreasing trend in sediment connectivity. Although the maximum IC value increased from 5.76 to 5.08 in the Jing sub-basin, driven by human activity, showing an increasing trend. Furthermore, the IC value decreased in the western part of the Wei sub-basin. Overall, sediment connectivity exhibits a weak decreasing trend in most regions of the Wei River basin, while it shows an increasing trend slightly in the Jing sub-basin. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.86, with sediment yield being moderately or strongly correlated with IC. Our study identified vegetation, human activity, and slope as the main influencing factors of IC. The results of factor detector showed that the q value of vegetation was 0.63 and the slope was 0.1, Vegetation played a major role in the change of IC. The results of interaction detector showed that interaction between vegetation and slope was greater than the single factor. The temporal variability of sediment connectivity in the basin provides valuable insights for sediment transport management. Our research highlights the importance of studying sediment connectivity and offers proposals for measures that can be taken to address sediment transport challenges in the Wei River basin.

The case study includes four overpasses, with various aerosol types and densities, covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and India regions characterized by frequent dust storms and smoke emissions, respectively, and Europe, a pioneer in establishing air quality policies. The values of aerosol centroid altitude are examined to determine the effects of climate (space) and season (time) on aerosol vertical distribution. For this purpose, 10-year mean values of aerosol centroid altitude were calculated over climate regions extracted from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) climate map as well as over each season, and the resultant values were then statistically analyzed. The results indicate that environmental heat, steam from climate or season, leads to aerosols increasing in altitude. The time series was imported in a version of the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, so-called BFAST01, allowing the magnitude of gradual changes along with the time and type of the major abrupt change to be determined. The strongest positive trends in aerosol centroid altitude were recorded in the desert regions. Positive trends were also observed in the mid-latitudes steppes and the North Sea. India was another region with a relatively positive trend which could be mainly caused by the increasing anthropogenic activities and smoke emission. The strongest negative trend detected in Europe is a result of strict environmental regulation policies and efforts for air quality improvement. The results show that a small fraction of granules (12 out of 4036) mainly in the northern part of overpass A, over Europe, the mid part of overpasses B and C, over the Middle East, and southern part of overpass D, over India, experienced structural changes. The reversal changes type 8 (50% of the abrupt changes) and interruption type 6 (33%) are the dominant types, mostly occurred around 2014 and 2012, respectively. Changing environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and anthropogenic activities are the main drivers of these changes. The study demonstrates the applicability of BFAST01 and the usability of CALIOP VFM time series data to monitor the vertical structure of the atmosphere. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","{""Brakhasi, F."",""Hajeb, M."",""Matkan, A."",""Mielonen, T."",""Verbesselt, J.""}","10.1016/j.rse.2021.112619",2024-07-19 19:07:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{calibration}","{Aerosol,Atmosphere}"
6691513,"Satellite observations of NO2 indicate legacy impacts of redlining in U.S. Midwestern cities","Redlining was a practice of financial discrimination in the mid-20th century in which banks refused loans or increased interest rates based on the grade of an applicant’s neighborhood as designated by the federally sponsored Home Owner’s Lending Commission (HOLC). The HOLC primarily graded neighborhoods from “A” (best) to “D” (hazardous) based on characteristics including the racial demographics and economic status of the residents, with neighborhoods with higher percentages of non-white and/or recent immigrant residents given lower grades; this and similar discriminatory practices can be traced to modern-day economic and environmental inequalities between neighborhoods. The legacy of redlining and related housing discrimination on modern-day urban air quality, which presents a significant threat to public health, remains an important issue in addressing environmental injustice in U.S. cities. In our study, we used remotely sensed estimates of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) collected with the TROPOMI satellite sensor, and shapefiles of redlined neighborhoods, to determine whether air quality varies among historic HOLC grades in 11 U.S. Midwestern metropolitan areas. This approach allowed us to test these tools for within-city analysis of NO2 for which high spatial and temporal resolution measurements are not often available, despite their importance for monitoring impacts on human health. We found that NO2 levels were as much as 16% higher in neighborhoods that were graded “D” compared to those graded “A” (as in Chicago), with the mean difference across all cities an increase of 7.3% ± 5.9%. These results present evidence of persistent modern-day inequality in urban air quality associated with historic discriminatory policies and should be used as an argument for government action improving air quality in neighborhoods that were poorly graded by the HOLC.","{""Hrycyna, Elizabeth""}","https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2022.00027",2024-04-25 02:18:54,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Redlining|Urban air quality|Nitrogen dioxide|Urban ecology|HOLC|TROPOMI""}"
6863031,"Long-Time Series Ecological Environment Quality Monitoring And Cause Analysis In The Dianchi Lake Basin, China","As the core area in the transformation of Kunming into an international center city, studying the changes in ecological environment quality and causes of the Dianchi Lake Basin is of great significance for its future optimization of the landscape pattern. This study is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to calculate the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) of the Dianchi Lake Basin from 1990 to 2020. Then we used Mann-Kendall mutation detection to obtain the time points when significant changes in RSEI occurred. Finally, the Geodetector and MGWR models were combined to analyse the driving factors of ecological quality changes in the Dianchi Lake Basin. The results show that: (1) The ecological environment quality of the Dianchi Lake Basin showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2020, with the mean value of RSEI increasing from 0.49 to 0.52. (2) According to the results of the mutation test, the years 1990, 1993, 2006, 2015, and 2020 were used as the time points for monitoring the ecological environment quality of the Dianchi Lake Basin over a long time series. The ecological environment quality of the study area in the past 30 years was mainly in an improved state, accounting for 49.43%. The ecological deterioration areas are mainly located in the northeastern part of Xishan District (north of Caohai Lake), the southwestern part of Guandu District, Kunyang Town in Jining District, and the northern areas of Jincheng and Shangsuan Town. (3) The single factor detection results show that elevation and slope have the strongest influence on RSEI. The q-value of average annual temperature has changed the most, from the 6th to the 3rd place. This indicates that the urban heat island effect and the expansion of construction land have had a greater impact on the quality of the local ecological environment in recent years. The multi-factor interaction test shows that the influence of each factor on RSEI is enhanced after the interaction. (4) The MGWR regression results show that the actual scales of action of the factors are inconsistent, with the most significant spatial heterogeneity in the Percentage of cropland area. Based on the above findings, it can provide data to support the future urban planning of the Dianchi Lake Basin. It also provides a new means of integrating Geodetector and MGWR into the study of ecological quality analysis. © 2023 The Authors","{""Ding, Z."",""Geng, J."",""Lei, X."",""Wu, Y."",""Xu, W."",""Yang, H."",""Ye, J."",""Yu, J.""}","10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110084",2024-10-03 17:34:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Dianchi Lake Basin"",""Ecological environment quality"",Geodetector,""Mann-Kendall mutation test"",""Multiscale geographic weighted regression""}"
6863001,"The Promise Of Information And Communication Technology In Healthcare: Extracting Value From The Chaos","Healthcare is an information business with expanding use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise.Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices.ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.

6862903,"Analysis Of Urban Sprawl And Growth Pattern Using Geospatial Technologies In Megacity, Bangkok, Thailand","Urbanization is a spatial process and involves multiple dimensions of the settlements where jobs and housing are the driving force for urban migration, causing the expansion of urban areas from the center of Bangkok to its vicinity. This study focuses on the changes in physical factors affecting urban expansion by using spatial analysis in term of remote sensing statistical models. Three years of aerial photo and satellite imagery studies (2000, 2010 and 2020) are used to determine urbanization which was input into the study of land-use changes to demonstrate the situation of urban sprawl. The changes in land use pattern of Bangkok and its vicinities during 2000–2020 demonstrates the consequences of urban migration based on Urban Index (UI) which presents urban sprawling of Bangkok to its vicinities. The results of analysis demonstrated that the five adjacent provinces of Bangkok have continued its growth with the higher sprawling rate based on entropy calculations ranging from 2.25 to 2.46 in 2020. The expanding from the capital city to the vicinity provinces has resulted due to the nodes of employment are clustered in the capital city. The settlement in the outskirt areas of Bangkok could help in reduction of living expenses within the urban areas, although require longer travel distance from the vicinities of Bangkok. The findings demonstrate the value of geospatial technologies in urban planning and environmental management to cope with the rapid urban expansion, resulting in urban sprawl for sustainable urban strategies and policies by controlling improper future of land use changes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","{""Iamtrakul, P."",""Klaylee, J."",""Padon, A.""}","10.1007/978-3-031-08017-3_10",2024-07-16 23:08:38,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{Antennas,Bangkok,""Environmental management"",""Environmental technology"",Expansion,""Geospatial technology"",""Growth patterns"",""Land use"",""Land use change"",""Landuse change"",""Mega City"",Megacities,""Remote sensing"",""Satellite imagery"",""Urban areas"",""Urban expansion"",""Urban growth"",""Urban sprawl"",""Urban sprawling"",Urbanization}"

6863279,"Deforestation And Co 2 Emissions In Coastal Tanzania From 1990 To 2007","Conversion of forest to other land uses is a major contributor to climate change. The coastal forests of Tanzania have increasingly been recognized as being of global biodiversity importance, due to high rates of species endemism. Rates of forest loss are similar to those of other tropical regions, resulting in increasing levels of threat for the biological values within the remaining forest and potentially significant source of CO 2 emissions. This study estimated the remaining cover and carbon stock of Tanzania's coastal forests and the CO 2 emissions due to forest loss between c. 1990 and c. 2007. Coastal Tanzania contained over 273 700 ha of forest in 2007. Deforestation rates in the area have slowed from 1.0% yr 1, or > 3735 ha yr 1 during the 1990s, to 0.4% yr 1, or > 1233 ha yr 1 during 2000-2007. Despite lower deforestation rates in 2000-2007, the percentage forest lost from within reserved areas has remained steady at 0.2% yr 1 for both time periods. CO 2 emissions from deforestation slowed from at least 0.63 Mt CO2 yr 1 in 1990-2000 to at least 0.20 Mt CO 2 yr 1 in 2000-2007. Regional forest clearance in Tanzania is highly dynamic; while rates have slowed since 2000, forest habitat conversion has continued and there is no guarantee that future rates will remain low. A rigorous policy on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) should be implemented to avoid future increases in deforestation rates. © 2011 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","{""Burgess, N.

6863229,"Prescribed Burning Protects Endangered Tropical Heathlands Of The Arnhem Plateau, Northern Australia","Summary: There are concerns that frequent intense fires are reducing biodiversity on the Arnhem Plateau within Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. Since the 1980s, prescribed burning in the early dry season has aimed to reduce the extent of late dry season wildfires. A programme of more strategic prescribed burning has been undertaken since 2007, aiming to increase intervals between fires affecting heathland and rain forest communities. We assess the effectiveness of prescribed burning in Kakadu's Stone Country using a Landsat satellite-derived fire history (1980-2011), in terms of achieving 'tolerable fire intervals' for dominant plant communities. Our analysis indicates that fire regimes have become substantially more favourable for biodiversity since the early 1980s. Although annual extent of burning has remained unchanged, two significant changes in fire regimes have occurred over the long term: (i) a switch from late dry season dominance to early dry season dominance and (ii) an increase in the abundance of long-unburnt vegetation, both of which are likely to benefit biodiversity. Demonstrating the statistical significance of changes associated with recent, more strategic fire management (2007-2011) is limited by the short duration of this management approach, although there is evidence of increasing abundance of long-unburnt vegetation during this time. The view that the Arnhem Plateau's fire regimes are increasingly driving biodiversity loss (due to frequent late dry season wildfires) is erroneous; they are in a more benign state now than at any time over the last three decades, most likely due to extensive use of prescribed burning. Synthesis and applications. In highly fire-prone landscapes, such as savannas, prescribed burning can be an effective means of: (i) bringing forward peak fire activity to the time of year when fire conditions are relatively mild and (ii) increasing abundance of long-unburnt vegetation. These changes are likely to favour persistence of a range of fire-sensitive communities. Our case study supports the strategic use of prescribed burning to protect fire-sensitive biota within highly fire-prone landscapes throughout the world.

6863111,"Crowdsourced Data For Bicycling Research And Practice","Cities are promoting bicycling for transportation as an antidote to increased traffic congestion, obesity and related health issues, and air pollution. However, both research and practice have been stalled by lack of data on bicycling volumes, safety, infrastructure, and public attitudes. New technologies such as GPS-enabled smartphones, crowdsourcing tools, and social media are changing the potential sources for bicycling data. However, many of the developments are coming from data science and it can be difficult evaluate the strengths and limitations of crowdsourced data. In this narrative review we provide an overview and critique of crowdsourced data that are being used to fill gaps and advance bicycling behaviour and safety knowledge. We assess crowdsourced data used to map ridership (fitness, bike share, and GPS/accelerometer data), assess safety (web-map tools), map infrastructure (OpenStreetMap), and track attitudes (social media). For each category of data, we discuss the challenges and opportunities they offer for researchers and practitioners. Fitness app data can be used to model spatial variation in bicycling ridership volumes, and GPS/accelerometer data offer new potential to characterise route choice and origin-destination of bicycling trips; however, working with these data requires a high level of training in data science. New sources of safety and near miss data can be used to address underreporting and increase predictive capacity but require grassroots promotion and are often best used when combined with official reports. Crowdsourced bicycling infrastructure data can be timely and facilitate comparisons across multiple cities; however, such data must be assessed for consistency in route type labels. Using social media, it is possible to track reactions to bicycle policy and infrastructure changes, yet linking attitudes expressed on social media platforms with broader populations is a challenge. New data present opportunities for improving our understanding of bicycling and supporting decision making towards transportation options that are healthy and safe for all. However, there are challenges, such as who has data access and how data crowdsourced tools are funded, protection of individual privacy, representativeness of data and impact of biased data on equity in decision making, and stakeholder capacity to use data given the requirement for advanced data science skills. If cities are to benefit from these new data, methodological developments and tools and training for end-users will need to track with the momentum of crowdsourced data. © 2020 The Author(s).

6903542,"Multi-Temporal Trend Analysis Of Coastal Vegetation Using Metrics Derived From Hyperspectral And Lidar Data","Monitoring and modeling of coastal vegetation and wetland systems are considered major challenges, especially when considering environmental response to hazards, disturbances, and management activities. Remote sensing applications can provide alternatives and complementary approaches to the often costly and laborious field-based collection methods traditionally used for coastal ecosystem monitoring. New and improved sensors and data analysis techniques have become available, making remote sensing applications attractive for evaluation and potential use in monitoring coastal vegetation properties and ecosystem conditions and change. This study involves the extraction of vegetation metrics from airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to quantify coastal dune vegetation characteristics and assesses landscape-level trends from those derived metrics. HSI- and LiDAR-derived elevation (digital elevation model) and vegetation metrics (canopy height model, leaf area index, and normalized difference vegetation index) were used in conjunction with per-pixel linear regression and hot spot analyses to evaluate hurricane-induced spatial and temporal changes in elevation and vegetation properties. These assessments showed areas with greatest decreases in vegetation metric values were associated with direct tropical storm energies and processes (i.e., overwashing events eroding beach and dune features), while those with the greatest increases in vegetation metric values were in areas where overwashed sediments were distributed. This study narrows existing gaps in dune vegetation data by advancing new methodologies to classify, quantify, and estimate critical coastal vegetation metrics. The tools and methods developed in this study will ultimately improve future estimates and predictions of nearshore dynamics and impacts from disturbance events.",NA,"10.3390/rs15082098",2024-09-27 23:14:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

Monitoring of thermal environments in urban areas such as hot spot analysis is required for effective actions to resolve these problems. This study selected 14 dongs and surrounding administrative districts of Sejong city as study areas and analyzed the characteristics of changes in surface temperature due to the urban expansion in the summer from 2013 to 2018. In the study, the surface temperature distributions in the study areas were plotted using surface temperature values from Landsat 8 and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) based on KOMPSAT 2/3 data, and the patterns of surface temperature changes with urban expansion were discussed using the estimated NDVI and NDBI. In particular, the distinct urbanization in the study areas were selected for case studies, and the cause of the changes in the hot spots in the regions was analyzed using high-resolution KOMPSAT images. This study results present that hot spots appeared in urbanized regions within the study areas, and it was plotted that the lower the NDVI values and the higher the NDBI values indicate the temperature values are high. The land surface temperature and satellite-based products were used to divide the study areas into continuously urbanized regions and rapidly urbanized regions and to identify the different characteristics depending on land covers. In the regions with distinct surface temperature changes by urbanization, the analysis using high-resolution KOMPSAT images as presented in this study could provide effective information for urban planning and policy utilization in the future.","{""Cho, Dongjin"",""Kim, Yeji"",""Park, Seonyoung"",""Yoo, Cheolhee""}","10.7780/kjrs.2019.35.6.4.9",2024-07-19 20:35:39,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Landsat 8; KOMPSAT; LST; Urban expansion; Thermal environment; Sejong city""}"
6862970,"Response Of Ecosystem Services To Land Use And Cover Change: A Case Study In Chengdu City","Land use and cover change is an important factor reflecting the resource footprints of the human race. Studies related to land use and cover change with ecosystem services value can provide a good reference for research on human resource footprints. In this study, through the interpretation of remote sensing images of Chengdu from 2000 to 2015, we obtained data on land use and cover change. Based on the analysis of the equivalent factor table for land use and cover change and ecosystem services value, we used the CPI accumulation coefficient and marginal value coefficient to modify the evaluation model of ecosystem services value, thus calculating the value of ecosystem services for Chengdu. The results show that the area under farmland and grassland continued to decrease, while the area covered by forest land, water area, construction land and unused land continued to increase in general. The ecosystem services value of Chengdu increased from 2.86 x 10(10) RMB yuan in 2000 to 5.02 x 10(10) RMB yuan in 2015, indicating a 75.46\% increase. From this study, we determined that the development of Chengdu during 2000-2015 is sustainable, with reasonable land use, and will provide an important reference for economic development and land use policy in Chengdu in the future.

6903636,"The Irrigation Cooling Effect As A Climate Regulation Service Of Agroecosystems","Agroecosystems provide a range of benefits to society and the economy, which we call ecosystem services (ES). These services can be evaluated on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The irrigation cooling effect (ICE), given its influence on the land surface temperature (LST), is an indicator of climate regulation services from agroecosystems. In this context, the objective of this study is to quantify the ICE in agroecosystems at the local scale. The agroecosystem of citrus cultivation in Campo de Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) is used as a case study. Once the LST was retrieved by remote sensing images for 216 plots, multivariate regression methods were used to identify the factors that explain ICE. The use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is proposed, instead of ordinary least squares, as it offsets the spatial dependence and gives a better fit. The GWR explains 78\% of the variability in the LST, by means of three variables: the vegetation index, the water index of the crop, and the altitude. Thus, the effects of the change in land use on the LST due to restrictions on the availability of water (up to 1.22 degrees C higher for rain-fed crops) are estimated. The trade-offs between ICE and the other ES are investigated by using the irrigation water required to reduce the temperature. This work shows the magnitude of the climate regulation service generated by irrigated citrus and enables its quantification in agroecosystems with similar characteristics.",NA,"10.3390/w12061553",2024-10-03 21:47:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863678,"Discovering Floristic And Geoecological Gradients Across Amazonia","Aim To map and interpret floristic and geoecological patterns across the Amazon basin by combining extensive field data with basin-wide Landsat imagery and climatic data. Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota. Our maps provide a preliminary geoecological subdivision of Amazonia that can now be tested and refined using field data of other plant groups and from hitherto unsampled areas.","{""Cardenas, Glenda"",""Figueiredo, Fernando O.

6863300,"Sustainable Forest Management Tools For The Moscow Region","The paper presents an inventory of current forest formations and a map of forest vegetation in the Moscow region. To assess current forest formations, an approach integrating both ground-and remote sensing data was applied. The transformation of forests in the Moscow region was evaluated by the criteria of changing the quality, quantity and spatial configuration of forests, in accordance with the model SLOSS (Single Large or Several Small). The conceptual model ""Pressure-State-Response"" (hereinafter PRS) was used to develop appropriate tools for sustainable environmental management in the region. The use of this model made it possible not only to assess the state of forests but also to determine the main impacts affecting them, as well as the effectiveness of measures aimed at optimizing environmental management regimes in order to maintain forest biodiversity. Complex assessment of sets of indicators for each group of PRS criteria is performed for the integrated multicriteria assessment of sustainable forest management within the boundaries of urban districts. The average normalized score was calculated for each group of criteria. Correlation between the scores of the groups of criteria evaluated and classification of administrative units according to the ratio of groups of the K-means method criteria performed. As a result of component-by-component evaluation, the values of indicators are presented in form of tables and map сharts. Benchmarking of Specially Protected Natural Area (SPNA) system and reforestation activities is performed regarding to the forest biodiversity conservation in the urban districts. It is shown that single integrated assessment of the ecological value of the territory (the ""State"" criterion), an integrated assessment of impact factors (the ""Load"") and appropriate actions to maintain forest biodiversity (the ""Response"" criterion) can be considered as an expression of generalized information directly used in decision-making and assessment of current trends for a particular region. © 2019, Lomonosov Moscow State University.

6903544,"Monthly, Seasonal, And Annual Variations Of Precipitation And Runoff Over West And Central Africa Using Remote Sensing And Climate Reanalysis","Precipitation and runoff variability over West and Central Africa is the major challenge of water resource management, which drives a range of socio-economic issues. Storm water runoff poses serious environmental problems and public health issues in these regions. We use descriptive statistics in order to analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual runoff and precipitation using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5) datasets, respectively for the period 1981-2021. Based on the results, the climate of the western zone is different from that of the equatorial zone, where runoff is persistently high throughout the year. Monthly and seasonal runoff show that June, July and August have higher runoff values. The high values for these three months correspond to the rainy season in these regions. Trends of the runoff and precipitation are detected using Mann-Kendall test. Apart of the coastal zones where trends are positive, trends in runoff are mostly negative throughout the Western and Central African regions. The result will benefit our understanding of the increasing suffrage of the local population from severe floods, landslides and soil erosion over this region.",NA,"10.1007/s41748-022-00326-w",2024-09-27 22:37:35,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862727,"A Decision Analysis Approach For Risk Management Of Near-Earth Objects","Risk management of near-Earth objects (NEOs; e.g., asteroids and comets) that can potentially impact Earth is an important issue that took on added urgency with the Chelyabinsk event of February 2013. Thousands of NEOs large enough to cause substantial damage are known to exist, although only a small fraction of these have the potential to impact Earth in the next few centuries. The probability and location of a NEO impact are subject to complex physics and great uncertainty, and consequences can range from minimal to devastating, depending upon the size of the NEO and location of impact. Deflecting a potential NEO impactor would be complex and expensive, and inter-agency and international cooperation would be necessary. Such deflection campaigns may be risky in themselves, and mission failure may result in unintended consequences. The benefits, risks, and costs of different potential NEO risk management strategies have not been compared in a systematic fashion. We present a decision analysis framework addressing this hazard. Decision analysis is the science of informing difficult decisions. It is inherently multi-disciplinary, especially with regard to managing catastrophic risks. Note that risk analysis clarifies the nature and magnitude of risks, whereas decision analysis guides rational risk management. Decision analysis can be used to inform strategic, policy, or resource allocation decisions. First, a problem is defined, including the decision situation and context. Second, objectives are defined, based upon what the different decision-makers and stakeholders (i.e., participants in the decision) value as important. Third, quantitative measures or scales for the objectives are determined. Fourth, alternative choices or strategies are defined. Fifth, the problem is then quantitatively modeled, including probabilistic risk analysis, and the alternatives are ranked in terms of how well they satisfy the objectives. Sixth, sensitivity analyses are performed in order to examine the impact of uncertainties. Finally, the need for further analysis, data collection, or refinement is determined. The first steps of defining the problem and the objectives are critical to constructing an informative decision analysis. Such steps must be undertaken with participation from experts, decision-makers, and stakeholders (defined here as ""derision participants""). The basic problem here can be framed as: ""What is the best strategy to manage risk associated with NEOs?"" Some high-level objectives might be to minimize: mortality and injuries, damage to critical infrastructure (e.g., power, communications and food distribution), ecosystem damage, property damage, ungrounded media and public speculation, resources expended, and overall cost. Another valuable objective would be to maximize inter-agency/government coordination. Some of these objectives (e.g., ""minimize mortality"") are readily quantified (e.g., deaths and injuries averted). Others are less so (e.g., ""maximize inter-agency/government coordination""), but these can be scaled. Objectives may be inversely related: e.g., a strategy that minimizes mortality may cost more. They are also unlikely to be weighted equally. Defining objectives and assessing their relative weight and interactions requires early engagement with decision participants. High-level decisions include whether to deflect a NEO, when to deflect, what is the best alternative for deflection/destruction, and disaster management strategies if an impact occurs. Important influences include, for example: NEO characteristics (orbital characteristics, diameter, mass, spin and composition), impact probability and location, interval between discovery and projected impact date, interval between discovery and deflection target date, costs of information collection, costs and technological feasibility of deflection alternatives, risks of deflection campaigns, requirements for inter-agency and international cooperation, and timing of informing the public. The analytical aspects of decision analysis center on estimation of the expected value (i.e. utility) of different alternatives. The expected value of an alternative is a function of the probability-weighted consequences, estimated using Bayesian calculations in a decision tree or influence diagram model. The result is a set of expected-value estimates for all alternatives evaluated that enables a ranking; the higher the expected value, the more preferred the alternative. A common way to include resource limitations is by framing the decision analysis in the context of economics (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis). An important aspect of decision analysis in the NEO risk management case is the ability, known as sensitivity analysis, to examine the effect of parameter uncertainty upon decisions. The simplest way to evaluate uncertainty associated with the information used in a decision analysis is to adjust the input values one at a time (or simultaneously) to examine how the results change. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to adjust the inputs over ranges or distributions of values; statistical means then are used to determine the most influential variables. These techniques yield a measure known as the expected value of imperfect information. This value is highly informative, because it allows the decision-maker with imperfect information to evaluate the impact of using experiments, tests, or data collection (e.g. Earth-based observations, space-based remote sensing, etc.) to refine judgments; and indeed to estimate how much should be spent to reduce uncertainty.

6862832,"Spatial Modeling Of Susceptibility To Subsidence Using Machine Learning Techniques","Land subsidence is a hazard that results from conditioning factors that cause environmental change and generate social and economic impacts. Some of these factors may increase dissolution of calcareous stones, change groundwater storage, or stem from mining, faulting, and seismic activity. Semnan Plain, Iran is experiencing land subsidence that, along with secondary impacts like surface fissures, is becoming increasingly troublesome. This study modeled land subsidence and created a susceptibility map using multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), and boosted regression tree (BRT) machine-learning methods. Analysis of satellite imagery, documents reporting past subsidence, and a contemporary field survey identified 65 sinkholes on Semnan Plain. Twelve conditioning factors were selected for analysis from a review of the scholarly literature, field investigation, and data availability. The three methods were used to model subsidence from a training subset of the known sites. The models were validated with the remaining subset of subsidence locations. Finally, susceptibility maps were used to predict other sites that are highly likely to see subsidence. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curves (AUC) were applied to assess the accuracies of the maps. AUC values (0.637, 0.783, and 0.712 for the BRT, MARS, and MDA models respectively) showed that MARS generated the most accurate model, MDA generated the second most accurate, and BRT's was the least accurate model. Subsidence susceptibility maps as produced here can be useful, meaningful, and functional tools for local and regional planners and policy makers involved in land use planning, resource management, and hazard mitigation.","{""Amiri, Mojtaba"",""Mohammady, Majid"",""Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza"",""Tiefenbacher, John P.""}","10.1007/s00477-020-01967-x",2024-07-19 23:49:40,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""Land subsidence; Boosted regression tree; Mixture discriminant analysis; Multivariate adaptive regre""}"
6903577,"Small Range And Distinct Distribution In A Satellite Breeding Colony Of The Critically Endangered Waved Albatross","To determine the proximate consequences of the limited breeding distribution of the critically endangered Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata), we present continuous breeding season GPS tracks highlighting differences in behaviour, destinations, and distances travelled between three distinct colonies: two in Galapagos and one closer to the South American continent on Isla de la Plata, where a small number of pairs nest. Accelerometer data paired with GPS locations allowed operational classifications of Waved Albatross behaviour. All birds from Galapagos travelled eastward to the continental shelf and foraged southward along the Peruvian coast. Birds from Isla de la Plata made more and shorter foraging trips and used habitat north of the destinations of Galapagos birds. La Plata birds foraged in areas through which Galapagos birds commuted, and had slower average flight speeds and shorter commutes. Overall, albatrosses from La Plata might operate under a consistently lower return but they also incur lower costs compared to birds from Galapagos, which take fewer trips involving longer time investment. Galapagos birds may be able to forage more effectively based on more abundant or more profitable food patches in those highly productive areas. Foraging destinations of birds from the two Galapagos colonies were similar and overlapped areas that presented localized mortality risk from artisanal fisheries in previous years. This study, performed across the species' breeding range, reveals the different foraging distribution of La Plata albatrosses and the potential conservation value of this small colony in terms of maintenance of spatial diversity and behavioural plasticity.",NA,"10.1007/s10336-013-1013-9",2024-10-01 17:25:01,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""satellite colony"",spurious}",NA
6863475,"Advances In Representing Interactive Methane In Modele2-Yibs (Version 1.1)","Methane (CH4) is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor of tropospheric ozone, making it an important focus of chemistry-climate interactions. Methane has both anthropogenic and natural emission sources, and reaction with the atmosphere's principal oxidizing agent, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is the dominant tropospheric loss process of methane. The tight coupling between methane and OH abundances drives indirect linkages between methane and other short-lived air pollutants and prompts the use of interactive methane chemistry in global chemistry-climate modeling. In this study, an updated contemporary inventory of natural methane emissions and the soil sink is developed using an optimization procedure that applies published emissions data to the NASA GISS ModelE2-Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (ModelE2-YIBs) global chemistry-climate model. Methane observations from the global surface air-sampling network of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are used to guide refinement of the natural methane inventory. The wetland methane flux is calculated as a best fit; thus, the accuracy of this derived flux assumes accurate simulation of methane chemical loss in the atmosphere and accurate prescription of the other methane fluxes (anthropogenic and natural). The optimization process indicates global annual wetland methane emissions of 140 Tg CH4 yr(-1). The updated inventory includes total global annual methane emissions from natural sources of 181 Tg CH4 yr(-1) and a global annual methane soil sink of 60 Tg CH4 yr(-1). An interactive methane simulation is run using ModelE2-YIBs, applying dynamic methane emissions and the updated natural methane emissions inventory that results from the optimization process. The simulated methane chemical lifetime of 10.4 +/- 0.1 years corresponds well to observed lifetimes. The simulated year 2005 global-mean surface methane concentration is 1.1\% higher than the observed value from the NOAA ESRL measurements. Comparison of the simulated atmospheric methane distribution with the NOAA ESRL surface observations at 50 measurement locations finds that the simulated annual methane mixing ratio is within 1\% (i.e., +1 \% to -1 \%) of the observed value at 76\% of locations. Considering the 50 stations, the mean relative difference between the simulated and observed annual methane mixing ratio is a model overestimate of only 0.5 \%. Comparison of simulated annual column-averaged methane concentrations with SCIAMACHY satellite retrievals provides an independent post-optimization evaluation of modeled methane. The comparison finds a slight model underestimate in 95\% of grid cells, suggesting that the applied methane source in the model is slightly underestimated or the model's methane sink strength is slightly too strong outside of the surface layer. Overall, the strong agreement between simulated and observed methane lifetimes and concentrations indicates that the ModelE2-YIBs chemistry-climate model is able to capture the principal processes that control atmospheric methane.","{""Harper, Kandice L."",""Unger, Nadine"",""Zheng, Yiqi""}","10.5194/gmd-11-4417-2018",2024-07-19 23:48:00,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{calibration}",NA
6863038,"A Pilot Asthma Incidence Surveillance System And Case Definition: Lessons Learned","Objectives. Surveillance for incident asthma in the general population could provide timely information about asthma trends and new, emerging etiologic factors. We sought to determine the feasibility of an asthma incidence surveillance system using voluntary reporting of asthma by outpatient clinics and emergency departments (EDs). Methods. Voluntary reporting occurred from July 2002 through June 2006. We classified reported asthma based on a case definition adapted from one developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. We validated the case definition by having pulmonologists review data from participant interviews, medical record abstractions, and pulmonary function test (PFT) results. Results. The positive predictive value (PPV) of meeting any of the case definition criteria for asthma was 80% to 82%. The criterion of taking at least one rescue and one controller medication had the highest PPV (97% to 100%). Only 7% of people meeting the incident case definition had a PFT documented in their medical record, limiting the usefulness of PFT results for case classification. Compared with pediatric participants, adult participants were more likely to be uninsured and to obtain asthma care at EDs. The surveillance system cost $5,129 per enrolled person meeting the incident case definition and was difficult to implement in participating clinics and EDs because asthma reporting was not mandatory and informed consent was necessary. Conclusions. The project was useful in evaluating the case definition's validity and in describing the participants' characteristics and health-care use patterns. However, without mandatory reporting laws, reporting of incident asthma in the general population by clinicians is not likely to be a feasible method for asthma surveillance. ©2009 Association of Schools of Public Health.","{""Brown, C."",""Martin, P."",""Mavunda, K."",""Rodriguez, D."",""Trepka, M.

6863302,"General Landscape Connectivity Model (Glcm): A New Way To Map Whole Of Landscape Biodiversity Functional Connectivity For Operational Planning And Reporting","Graph-theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities. We developed the new General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM), as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans. GLCM is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology-based measures: Neighbourhood habitat area (Ni) and habitat link value (Li). Ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross-scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat. The remaining Ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of Ecological Carrying Capacity for wildlife (plants and animals). Li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region (i.e. which is reported as summed Ni across a region) by virtue of providing the 'least-cost' linkages between concentrations of habitat. Mapped Li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region's habitat network, highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping-stones, and candidate areas for conservation and restoration. Due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design, GLCM addresses a number of criteria we list as important, while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph-theoretical approaches. We present results for three south-east Australian case studies using continuous-value ecological condition surfaces as input. However, a simple habitat/non-habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used. GLCM has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales, and broader. It incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes (foraging, dispersal and migration). Successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling-law. This approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data-driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations. The operational advantages of GLCM means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time-series remote sensing of land cover, or applied to alternative scenarios of land use, ecological restoration, climate projections or combinations of these.","{""Drielsma, Michael J."",""Love, Jamie"",""Taylor, Subhashni"",""Thapa, Rajesh"",""Williams, Kristen J.""}","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109858",2024-07-18 23:49:50,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{""RS not specifically used""}","{""landscape connectivity; Ecological carrying capacity; reporting; multiple scales; scaling law""}"
6903631,"Mining Subsidence Monitoring Using Distributed Scatterers Insar Based On Goldstein Filter And Fisher Information Matrix-Weighted Optimization","Due to the shortcomings of traditional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technologies in mining subsidence monitoring, such as a low density of monitoring points and difficulty obtaining fine surface deformation information, this paper proposes a mining area surface deformation monitoring method based on distributed scatterers InSAR while improving the phase information optimization strategy. This method obtains homogeneous points using the hypothesis test of confidence interval algorithm and constructs an adaptive phase optimization method based on the Goldstein principal phase filtering and Fisher information matrix weighting. It effectively preserves the information of deformation fringes, particularly in regions with dense interferometric fringes, and obtains detailed deformation information from the study area through time processing. In the experiments, 63 Sentinel-1 images were used to extract surface subsidence information for the Peibei mining area from September 24, 2018, to November 12, 2020. Compared with the Permanent Scatterers InSAR (PS-InSAR) results, the point density increased by a factor of 4.2. The correlation coefficient between the homonymous points obtained with the two methods and the deformation rate is 0.94, indicating that they have a good consistency. The monitoring results show that the six mining areas in Peibei have different degrees of subsidence during the monitoring period with a clear nonlinear trend, and the maximum cumulative subsidence over time exceeds 350 mm. The analysis shows that the improved DS-InSAR monitoring results are in line with the general law of mining subsidence and have practical application value.",NA,"10.1007/s11069-023-06359-2",2024-09-27 23:10:09,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863584,"Assessing Irrigation Water Use With Remote Sensing-Based Soil Water Balance At An Irrigation Scheme Level In A Semi-Arid Region Of Morocco","This study aims to evaluate a remote sensing-based approach to allow estimation of the temporal and spatial distribution of crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation water requirements over irrigated areas in semi-arid regions. The method is based on the daily step FAO-56 Soil Water Balance model combined with a time series of basal crop coefficients and the fractional vegetation cover derived from high-resolution satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. The model was first calibrated and validated at plot scale using ET measured by eddy-covariance systems over wheat fields and olive orchards representing the main crops grown in the study area of the Haouz plain (central Morocco). The results showed that the model provided good estimates of ET for wheat and olive trees with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.56 and 0.54 mm/day respectively. The model was then used to compare remotely sensed estimates of irrigation requirements (RS-IWR) and irrigation water supplied (WS) at plot scale over an irrigation district in the Haouz plain through three growing seasons. The comparison indicated a large spatio-temporal variability in irrigation water demands and supplies; the median values of WS and RS-IWR were 130 (175), 117 (175) and 118 (112) mm respectively in the 2002-2003, 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 seasons. This could be attributed to inadequate irrigation supply and/or to farmers' socio-economic considerations and management practices.

6863092,"Impact, Efficiency, Inequality, And Injustice Of Urban Air Pollution: Variability By Emission Location","Reducing exposure to air pollution is an important goal for many local and national governments. Disparities in air pollution exposure by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class are well documented; reducing these disparities is another important policy target. Meeting both goals requires tools to evaluate how emission reduction options affect average exposures and exposure disparities. Here, we consider the role of emission location in implementing control strategies, and investigate the effect of two practical, space-based approaches-low-emission zones and truck rerouting-on diesel particle levels in Southern California. We employ Eulerian grid modeling to explore the impact that emission location has on four outcomes important to policymakers: total pollution exposure, exposure efficiency (i.e. exposure impact per unit emission), exposure inequality (i.e. deviations from exposure being equally distributed across the population; unequal exposure among individuals), and exposure injustice (i.e. associations between exposure and demographic attributes such as race or ethnicity; unequal exposure among groups). Our results highlight potential trade-offs (e.g. an increase in equality but reduction in justice for interventions in some locations) as well as opportunities for 'win-win' solutions (locations for which emission reductions would reduce all four target outcomes). We find that a simple, straightforward approach-reducing emissions in neighborhoods with a high proportion of minority residents-may or may not yield the strongest benefits to environmental justice; the reason is that the straightforward approach fails to account for meteorology and where pollution travels after being emitted. In short, we demonstrate an approach that can be used to identify areas in which emissions reductions would have high efficiency and would also result in disproportionately large reductions to average exposure, exposure inequality, and exposure injustice. The approach presented here could be used to design and prioritize local or national emission reduction efforts.","{""Marshall, Julian D."",""Nguyen, Nam P.""}","10.1088/1748-9326/aa9cb5",2024-07-18 22:37:31,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2018,"{}","{""environmental justice; environmental equality; air pollution; diesel; particulate matter""}"
6863701,"Assessing Waterlogging Stress Level Of Winter Wheat From Hyperspectral Imagery Based On Harmonic Analysis","Frequent waterlogging disasters can have serious effects on regional ecology, food safety, and socioeconomic sustainable development. Early monitoring of waterlogging stress levels is vital for accurate production input management and reduction of crop production-related risks. In this study, a pot experiment on winter wheat was designed using three varieties and seven gradients of waterlogging stress. Hyperspectral imagery of the winter wheat canopy in the jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage, filling stage, and maturation stage were measured and then classified. Wavebands of imaging data were screened. Waterlogging stress level was assessed by a combined harmonic analysis method, and application of this method at field scale was discussed preliminarily. Results show that compared to the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine algorithms, the random forest algorithm is the best batch classification method for hyperspectral imagery of potted winter wheat. It can recognize waterlogging stress well in the wavebands of red absorption valley (RW: 640–680 nm), red-edge (RE: 670–737 nm), and near-infrared (NIR: 700–900 nm). In the RW region, amplitudes of the first three harmonic sub-signals (c1, c2, and c3) can be used as indexes to recognize the waterlogging stress level that each winter wheat variety undertakes. The third harmonic sub-signal amplitude c3 of the RE region is also suitable for judging stress levels of JM31 (one of the three varieties which is highly sensitive to water content). This study has important theoretical significance and practical application values related to the accurate control of waterlogging stress, and functions as a new method to monitor other types of environmental stress levels such as drought stress, freezing stress, and high-temperature stress levels. © 2021 by the authors.

6903498,"Spatial And Temporal Variation Of Net Carbon Sink Function Of Farmland In Aksu Oasis In The Past 17 Years","Studying the spatial and temporal variations of the net carbon sink function of oasis farmland is important for its management and sustainable development. The net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland was estimated on the basis of remote sensing, meteorological data and agricultural inputs, and other related statistics from 2001 to 2017. The following results are presented. (1) In the past 17 years, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of oasis farmland in Aksu showed an increasing trend yearly, with an average annual growth rate of 7.43%. Among which, the area of oasis farmland with a significant increasing trend of NEP was 1.44 × 104 km2, accounting for 97.7% of its total area, which is mainly distributed in various counties and cities. The area with a significant decreasing trend was 339 km2, accounting for 2.3% of the total area, mainly in the oasis areas of Wensu, Awati, Aksu, and Kuche counties. (2) Carbon emissions from agricultural production inputs increased from 39.94 × 104 t in 2001 to 106.73 × 104 t in 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25.14% and high and low distribution patterns in the Southeast and Northwest, respectively, considering spatial distribution. The largest proportions of agricultural production input pathways are fertilizer and agricultural machinery at 28% and 26%, respectively. (3) From 2001 to 2017, the net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland showed a fluctuating upward trend, spatially demonstrating a gradual increase from Northwest to Southeast, with high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of Wensu county, the western part of Aksu City, the entire territory of Alar City, and the eastern part of Xinhe County. Overall, Aksu oasis farmland has a high net carbon sink capacity. However, regional differences are found in the net carbon sinks of oasis farmland among counties and cities. Thus, the net carbon sink capacity of oasis farmland should be improved by optimizing the agricultural industry structure and enhancing farming measures. © 2022 Editorial office of Arid Zone Research.

6862775,"Protected Areas In Boreal Canada: A Baseline And Considerations For The Continued Development Of A Representative And Effective Reserve Network","Boreal forests maintain regionally important biodiversity and globally important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and freshwater resources. Many boreal systems have limited anthropogenic disturbances and are preserved, in effect, to date largely by their harsh climates and remoteness. As of 2011, almost 10\% of Canada is subject to some manner of formal protection, with 4.5\% of this protected area found within the boreal zone. The management of existing parks and protected areas (PPAs) is shared amongst many federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Although there are currently low levels of anthropogenic development in some portions of the boreal zone (especially the north), if expansion of protected areas is of interest, there are challenges to traditional PPA networks that may be more prominent in the boreal zone than elsewhere: (1) the boreal zone is home to charismatic mammal species with area requirements much larger than typical PPAs; (2) the boreal zone is characterized by natural disturbance regimes that impact large areas; and (3) projected changes to climate for the boreal zone are among the greatest in the world, creating temporal considerations for conservation planning exercises. There is currently no PPA assessment specific to boreal Canada. To address this lack of an assessment, we developed a conservation gap analysis of the current PPA system with respect to a variety of environmental surrogates (ecozones, land cover, vegetation productivity, and landscape structure). The amount of formally protected land varied within each surrogate, with few commonly reported features meeting national or international conservation targets. Furthermore, few reserves met the areal requirements that have been previously recommended to protect large mammals or accommodate the disturbance regimes present. We also discuss considerations and implications of area-based versus value-based protection objectives. While recognizing that there are still scientific challenges around understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of PPAs, based upon our review and assessment, the following considerations should inform conservation options for the boreal zone: (1) representation of the distribution of natural features within the PPA network; (2) effective maintenance of habitat requirements and spatial resilience to both cyclical and directional changes in spatial patterns through large, connected reserves; and (3) implementation of sustainable forest management practices (where applicable) throughout the broader landscape, as traditional on-reserve protection is unlikely to be sufficient to meet conservation goals. The Canadian boreal is unique in possessing large tracts of inaccessible forested lands that are not subject to management interventions, thereby offering functions similar to protected lands. The question of how to more formally integrate these lands into the existing PPA network requires further consideration. Further, the important temporal role of landscape dynamics in designing an effective PPA needs to be further studied as well as development of a better understanding of design needs in the context of a changing climate.","{""Andrew, Margaret E."",""Cardille, Jeffrey A."",""Wulder, Michael A.""}","10.1139/er-2013-0056",2024-07-16 22:46:14,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{""climate change; gap analysis; remote sensing; landscape dynamics; prioritization; representation; wi""}"
6863659,"Mapping High-Resolution Forest Aboveground Biomass Of China Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data","Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is crucial for carbon cycle studies and climate change mitigation actions. However, because of limitations in timely and reliable forestry surveys and high-resolution remote sensing data, producing a fine resolution and spatial continuous forest AGB map of China is challenging. Here, we combined 4789 ground-truth AGB measurements and multisource remote sensing data such as a recently released forest canopy-height product, optical spectral indexes, topographic data, climatological data, and soil properties to train a random forest regression model for forest AGB estimation of China at 30-m resolution. The accuracy of the estimated AGB can yield R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 70.71 Mg/ha. The nationwide estimates show that the average forest AGB and total forest carbon storage were 97.57 +/- 23.85 Mg/ha and 11.06 Pg C for the year 2019, respectively. The value of AGB uncertainty ranges from 0.68 Mg/ha to 37.80 Mg/ha, and the average AGB uncertainty was 4.32 +/- 1.75 Mg/ha. The forest AGB estimates of China in this study correspond reasonably well with the AGB estimates derived from the forestry and grassland statistical yearbook at the provincial level (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 30.15 Mg/ha). In addition, we found that previous AGB products generally underestimate the forest AGB compared with our estimated AGB at the pixel-level and ground-truth AGB measurements. The high-resolution forest AGB map provides an important alternative data source for forest carbon cycle studies and can be used as a baseline map for forest management and conservation practices.","{""Feng, Yuhao"",""Guo, Qinghua"",""Liu, Xiaoqiang"",""Ma, Qin"",""Niu, Chunyue"",""Tang, Hao"",""Wang, Xuejing"",""Yang, Qiuli""}","10.1080/15481603.2023.2203303",2024-07-18 22:08:06,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{calibration}","{""Forest AGB; in situ measurements; canopy height; high resolution; China""}"
6863502,"Urban Forest Structure Effects On Property Value","Studies have quantified urban forests using well established field sampling methods. Other studies have used hedonic regression with real estate prices and remotely sensed vegetation cover data in valuation models. However, remote sensing introduces unfamiliar perspectives since it changes the scale and resolution perceived by humans. Real estate prices also fluctuate and are not regularly used in urban decision-making processes. This study values an urban forest cultural ecosystem service by integrating an explanatory hedonic regression model with randomly field-measured tree, shrub, and turf data horn Foul cities across Florida, USA, during 2006-2009, and congruent parcel tract-level home attributes and appraised property values from single and multi-family units for 2008-2009. Results, on average, indicate trade-offs in that more trees with greater Leaf Area Indices (LAIs) add to property value, while biomass and tree-shrub cover have a neutral effect, and replacing tree with grass cover has lower value. On average, property value increased by \$1586 per tree and \$9348 per one-unit increase in LAI, while increasing maintained grass from 25\% to 75\% decreased home value by \$271. Our ecological approach is an alternative, applied method that can be used by decision-makers for policy and cost-benefit analyses that calculate the stream of net benefits associated with urban forests.

6863294,"Assessing Multi-Criteria Approaches With Environmental, Economic And Social Attributes, Weights And Procedures: A Case Study In The Pampas, Argentina","Soil erosion control is a major issue in agriculture. The no till system of soybean production has been widely adopted; however, soil erosion may increase due to pasture and forestry land convert ion to crop-land in the marginal Pampas, Argentina. The aim of this paper is to assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 km(2)) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion. sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming. compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","{""Anton, J. M."",""Cantero, A."",""Cisneros, J.

6862993,"Quantifying The Vegetation Health Based On The Resilience In An Arid System","Proper management of natural ecosystems is not possible without the knowledge of the health status of its components. Vegetation, as the main component of the ecosystem, plays an important role in its health. One of the key determinants of vegetation health is its resilience in the face of environmental disorders. This research was conducted in parts of the Namakzar-e Khaf watershed in Northeast of South Khorasan Province with the aim of quantifying the vegetative resilience on behalf of the ecosystem health in response to long-term precipitation changes. First, the annual precipitation standardization was performed during a thirty-year period by the SPI method. Then, the average variation in TNDVI index obtained from the Landsat satellite images was examined and the resilience was tested by calculating the four effective factors (amplitude, malleability, damping and hysteresis). According to the results, the amplitude in the survey period was 6.04% and the vegetation has had different values of damping over the years. The most prominent example of vegetation resilience occurred between 1986 and 1996, with malleability of 0.7 and damping of zero. Vegetation in this period, after the elimination of drought effects (1986), has not only returned to the amount of vegetation of reference year with severe precipitation (1996) but also increased by 0.25%. This increase, as the index of hysteresis, has been presented for the first time in the ecosystem health discussion quantitatively in the present study. A set of quantitative calculations showed that despite reduced annual precipitation and drought events, the vegetation has been able to maintain its resilience, which indicates the health of vegetation in the studied ecosystem. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

6863567,"Digital Communications And Information Systems","Introduction: Digital communications and information systems infrastructure is comprised of a variety of communication and computation systems which provide the transmission, processing and storage of digital information. This includes: (i) legacy and fibre-optic cable networks; (ii) mobile, satellite and wireless networks; and (iii) data storage and processing centres. The acronym ICT is often used to describe these systems, though in other contexts ICT can refer to a much broader class of information and communications technologies. Here we use the shorthand ICT to refer to digital communications and information infrastructure systems. In comparison to other physical infrastructure sectors, ICT is relatively new and very rapidly evolving, so is less completely understood from a system-of-systems perspective. ICT infrastructure has become increasingly embedded in nearly all economic and social activities, including for operation of other infrastructure networks. Because of the complexity and rapid innovation in ICT systems, their future is highly uncertain and analysing the systems’ prospective direction is challenging. Yet, issues surrounding digital connectivity are high on the global policy agenda. In many advanced economies in Europe, North America and beyond, significant increases in ICT capacity have been delivered by inducing competition within industry combined with a light-touch, market-led regulatory approach. Innovation has provided new technologies and has helped serve growing consumer demand, which is itself largely driven by innovations in consumer technologies and business practices. Globally, the telecommunications sector has increased dramatically over the past decade to serve almost three billion Internet users, amounting to over 40% of the world's population (ITU, 2014a). Investment in competitive markets by network operators is underpinned by analysis comparing prospective revenues with investment costs (Tselekounis and Varoutas, 2013) so is determined by population density, topology and the capital cost of new technologies (Gotz, 2013). Population density is an important factor in serving local telecommunication markets because, like other infrastructure systems, large fixed-capital investments need to be spread over many consumers with the purchasing power to acquire service subscriptions. However, if left to its own devices the market would likely be considered to be socially unjust and not provide all the potential welfare benefits, as the majority of investment would likely flow into pockets of dense, wealthy and well-educated urban areas. This would particularly leave remote rural or other uneconomically viable locations at a severe disadvantage. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","{""Ebrahimy, R."",""Jones, C. B."",""Oughton, E.

6863378,"Improving Emergency Treatment For Patients With Acute Stroke: The Pears Research Programme, Including The Pasta Cluster Rct","Background: Intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy are proven emergency treatments for acute ischaemic stroke, but they require rapid delivery to selected patients within specialist services. National audit data have shown that treatment provision is suboptimal. Objectives: The aims were to (1) determine the content, clinical effectiveness and day 90 cost-effectiveness of an enhanced paramedic assessment designed to facilitate thrombolysis delivery in hospital and (2) model thrombectomy service configuration options with optimal activity and cost-effectiveness informed by expert and public views. Design: A mixed-methods approach was employed between 2014 and 2019. Systematic reviews examined enhanced paramedic roles and thrombectomy effectiveness. Professional and service user groups developed a thrombolysis-focused Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment, which was evaluated in a pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial and parallel process evaluation. Clinicians, patients, carers and the public were surveyed regarding thrombectomy service configuration. A decision tree was constructed from published data to estimate thrombectomy eligibility of the UK stroke population. A matching discrete-event simulation predicted patient benefits and financial consequences from increasing the number of centres. Setting: The paramedic assessment trial was hosted by three regional ambulance services (in north-east England, north-west England and Wales) serving 15 hospitals. Participants: A total of 103 health-care representatives and 20 public representatives assisted in the development of the paramedic assessment. The trial enrolled 1214 stroke patients within 4 hours of symptom onset. Thrombectomy service provision was informed by a Delphi exercise with 64 stroke specialists and neuroradiologists, and surveys of 147 patients and 105 public respondents. Interventions: The paramedic assessment comprised additional pre-hospital information collection, structured hospital handover, practical assistance up to 15 minutes post handover, a pre-departure care checklist and clinician feedback. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes included day 90 health (poor status was a modified Rankin Scale score of > 2). Economic outputs reported the number of cases treated and cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life-years and Great British pounds. Data sources: National registry data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme and the Scottish Stroke Care Audit were used. Review methods: Systematic searches of electronic bibliographies were used to identify relevant literature. Study inclusion and data extraction processes were described using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: The paramedic assessment trial found a clinically important but statistically non-significant reduction in thrombolysis among intervention patients, compared with standard care patients [197/500 (39.4%) vs. 319/714 (44.7%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.08; p = 0.15). The rate of poor health outcomes was not significantly different, but was lower in the intervention group than in the standard care group [313/489 (64.0%) vs. 461/690 (66.8%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.2; p = 0.39). There was no difference in the quality-adjusted life-years gained between the groups (0.005, 95% confidence interval –0.004 to 0.015), but total costs were significantly lower for patients in the intervention group than for those in the standard care group (–£1086, 95% confidence interval –£2236 to –£13). It has been estimated that, in the UK, 10,140–11,530 patients per year (i.e. 12% of stroke admissions) are eligible for thrombectomy. Meta-analysis of published data confirmed that thrombectomy-treated patients were significantly more likely to be functionally independent than patients receiving standard care (odd ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.88 to 3.04; n = 1841). Expert consensus and most public survey respondents favoured selective secondary transfer for accessing thrombectomy at regional neuroscience centres. The discrete-event simulation model suggested that six new English centres might generate 190 quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval –6 to 399 quality-adjusted life-years) and a saving of £1,864,000 per year (95% confidence interval –£1,204,000 to £5,017,000 saving per year). The total mean thrombectomy cost up to 72 hours was £12,440, mostly attributable to the consumables. There was no significant cost difference between direct admission and secondary transfer (mean difference –£368, 95% confidence interval –£1016 to £279; p = 0.26). Limitations: Evidence for paramedic assessment fidelity was limited and group allocation could not be masked. Thrombectomy surveys represented respondent views only. Simulation models assumed that populations were consistent with published meta-analyses, included limited parameters reflecting underlying data sets and did not consider the capital costs of setting up new services. Conclusions: Paramedic assessment did not increase the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis, but outcomes were consistent with improved cost-effectiveness at day 90, possibly reflecting better informed treatment decisions and/or adherence to clinical guidelines. However, the health difference was non-significant, small and short term. Approximately 12% of stroke patients are suitable for thrombectomy and widespread provision is likely to generate health and resource gains. Clinician and public views support secondary transfer to access treatment. © 2022, NIHR Journals Library.

6863123,"Coastal Mountain Landscape And Urban Plant Planning Based On Remote Sensing Imaging","Due to the gradual decline of plant diversity, the distribution structure and spatial pattern of plant diversity have undergone significant changes in recent years. As a substantial reference standard for assessing whether the ecological functions of urban gardens can be performed commonly, the quality of the urban ecological environment, and the goodness of the urban human settlement environment, plant diversity is essential. If plant diversity presents a rich situation, it can play a critical role in improving the ecological environment’s quality and providing a solid material foundation for human development. Suppose you want to achieve sustainable growth in urban development. In that case, it is of positive significance to carry out protection and development projects for plant diversity within the city’s jurisdiction. To implement long-term green development goals, it is necessary to formulate a planning outline that meets actual needs. The stability of the upper-level planning and the richness of the landscape can also be fully guaranteed. The methods used in this study mainly include (1) unary linear regression and Mann-Kendall trend test; (2) interannual change extraction and data normalization; and (3) correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. The changing trend of ecological vegetation within a predetermined range and its significant development stage are obtained through unary linear regression and trend testing. Interannual change extraction and data normalization are used to get the interannual change characteristics of vegetation and climate factors and make them comparable. Use correlation analysis and multiple linear regression methods to analyze the driving analysis of natural and human ecological vegetation changes. Therefore, changes in climatic conditions and human activities can directly affect vegetation growth trends’ critical factors.

6862753,"Modeling Regional Crop Yield And Irrigation Demand Using Smap Type Of Soil Moisture Data","Agricultural models, such as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), have been developed for predicting crop yield at field and regional scales and to provide useful information for water resources management. A potentially valuable input to agricultural models is soil moisture. Presently, no observations of soil moisture exist covering the entire United States at adequate time (daily) and space (similar to 10 km or less) resolutions desired for crop yield assessments. Data products from NASA's upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will fill the gap. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of the SMAP soil moisture data in modeling and forecasting crop yields and irrigation amount. A simple, efficient data assimilation algorithm is presented in which the agricultural crop model DSSAT-CSM is constrained to produce modeled crop yield and irrigation amounts that are consistent with SMAP-type data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating the SMAP data into the agricultural model provides an added benefit of reducing the uncertainty of modeled crop yields when the weather input data to the crop model are subject to large uncertainty.","{""El Sharif, Husayn"",""Georgakakos, Aris P."",""Wang, Jingfeng""}","10.1175/jhm-d-14-0034.1",2024-09-30 01:58:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}","{""Remote sensing; Numerical analysis; modeling; Agriculture""}"
6862787,"Use Of A Neuro-Variational Inversion For Retrieving Oceanic And Atmospheric Constituents From Satellite Ocean Colour Sensor: Application To Absorbing Aerosols","This paper presents a new development of the NeuroVaria method. NeuroVaria computes relevant atmospheric and oceanic parameters by minimizing the difference between the observed satellite reflectances and those computed from radiative transfer simulations modelled by artificial neural networks. Aerosol optical properties are computed using the Junge size distribution allowing taking into account highly absorbing aerosols. The major improvement to the method has been to implement an iterative cost function formulation that makes the minimization more efficient. This implementation of NeuroVaria has been applied to sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery. A comparison with in situ measurements and the standard SeaWiFS results for cases without absorbing aerosols shows that this version of NeuroVaria remains consistent with the former. Finally, the processing of SeaWiFS images of a plume of absorbing aerosols off the US East coast demonstrate the ability of this improved version of NeuroVaria to deal with absorbing aerosols. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The assessment was performed based on a previously developed geographical information systems (GIS) package that integrates satellite-derived data of solar irradiation with locally obtained data such as land usage, topography, road lines, and an electrical network. For the evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility, annual energy production and electrical cost were calculated using an analysis tool that was integrated into a GIS package. The results show that more than 93\% of the exploitable land that covers the area of 49,859 km(2)is available for the development of solar PV plants, with an annual energy production higher than 180 GWh/km(2)and an electricity cost lower than 0.05 USD/kWh, indicating the attractiveness of utility-scale solar PV plant development in West Kalimantan Province. A further detailed assessment of optimal sites shows that the selected sites are technically and economically feasible for the development of utility-scale solar PV plants. The approaches and results of this research should be valuable for energy planners, developers, and policy makers to set the strategies for promoting the development of utility-scale solar PV plants in pro of the sustainable development of Indonesia.","{""Budiarto, Irwan"",""Ibrahim-Bathis, Kunhali"",""Murti, Sakti A."",""Ruiz, Harold S."",""Sunarso, Alfeus""}","10.3390/su12156283",2024-07-17 19:29:09,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""technical feasibility; economic feasibility; utility-scale solar PV plant; GIS; solar energy resourc""}"
6862728,"Seasonal Variation In Space Use By Nonbreeding Bald Eagles Within The Upper Chesapeake Bay","Access to food resources is essential to self-maintenance and reproduction and, for species of conservation concern, foraging areas are considered critical habitat. Human disturbance is an important factor restricting access to prey resources for Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and guidelines in the Chesapeake Bay have been developed to mitigate its impact. However, our ability to implement such guidelines has been limited by a lack of information on important foraging areas. We used Brownian bridge movement modeling to develop a population-wide utilization probability surface for Bald Eagles along shorelines within the upper Chesapeake Bay. We used locations (n=320 304) for individuals (n=63) tracked with GPS satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2011 in the analysis. We examined seasonal variation by developing utilization surfaces for summer and winter. Although shoreline use was widespread, segments receiving high levels of activity were relatively rare. Shoreline classified as having the highest category of use and accounting for 10\% of the total utilization made up 0.41\% and 0.55\% of the total shoreline for winter and summer, respectively. From a management perspective, there is a clear pattern of diminishing returns in conservation value for including sequentially lower-use shorelines in land-use management plans. Shoreline use shifted dramatically in both location and extent between seasons. During the summer months, use was highly concentrated on shorelines along the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay or along major (>1 km wide) tributaries. During the winter months, use shifted away from the main stem of the bay and was more focused on minor (<100 m wide) tributaries and inland ponds. Seasonal shifts in shoreline use suggest the need for season-based management objectives.","{""Mojica, Elizabeth K."",""Paxton, Barton J."",""Watts, Bryan D.""}","10.3356/jrr-13-61.1",2024-07-18 23:47:08,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}","{""Bald Eagle; Haliaeetus leucocephalus; Brownian bridge movement modeling; Chesapeake Bay; foraging; l""}"

This study investigates the significance of ecosystem services on peoples' lives and how these services are affected by climate change and other factors. Here an economic valuation framework was used to list the ecosystem services provided by this mangrove forest. Direct uses included timber, golpata (Nypa fruticans), honey, beeswax, fish, shrimp larvae and tourism. Indirect uses included carbon storage, protection from cyclones and tidal surges, breeding and nursery grounds for the aquatic species, and biodiversity conservation. This work also found that the ecosystem services were diminished by fresh water flow reduction, overharvesting, sea level rise, salinity increase, poaching, and climate change. In the present context and future scenario, sea level rise will be an important contributor to changes in ecosystem services. But because many factors impact sea level rise, the impact of climate change takes on less importance than many other causes of ecosystem service degradation in the Bangladesh Sundarbans.","{""Abdullah-Al-Mamun, M.

6863664,"Avulsions Drive Ecosystem Services And Economic Changes In The Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands","The Pantanal wetland is a mosaic of landscapes that brings together rich biodiversity with the valuable activities of fishing, tourism and ranching. Human occupation and land use in the headwaters have intensified the rate of channel avulsions in the lower reaches of the largest megafan on the Taquari River. This study evaluates the longterm changes of landscapes in the active depositional lobe of the Taquari megafan from the perspective of local communities of pantaneiros. Maps derived from multiple decades of multispectral Landsat data have proven useful for studying land cover changes through the relationship between dry (terrestrial vegetation and soil/dry pastures) and humid landscapes (open waters, aquatic macrophytes and wet soils), as well as through Sankey diagrams and spatiotemporal mapping with Boolean operations according to the rate of dryland recovery. We found that dryland recovery associated with an older and smaller avulsion (known as Ze ' da Costa) is analogous to that of a most recent and much larger avulsion (known as Caronal), which is still ongoing and has greater importance due to the scale of the impacts. Land value and fish capture depreciate as the partial Caronal avulsion still evolves, increasing the likelihood of environmental conflicts. While pantaneiros no longer profit from ecosystem services of provision (e.g., livestock or fishing), dryland recovery may deliver quantifiable ecosystem services of regulation. The strengthening of partnerships among stakeholders and the implementation of environmental compensation mechanisms are central for the best management of the Pantanal's megafans that ensure quality of life for all pantaneiros.","{""Assine, Mario L."",""Bergier, Ivan"",""Louzada, Romullo O."",""McGlue, Michael M."",""Roque, Fabio O."",""Silva, Aguinaldo""}","10.1016/j.crsust.2021.100057",2024-09-27 23:42:06,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""Avulsion; Distributary channel; Ecosystem services; Fluvial succession; Land restoration""}"
6691560,"A Transformative Concept: From Data being Passive Objects to Data being Active Subjects","The exploitation of potential societal benefits of Earth observations is hampered by users having to engage in often tedious processes to discover data and extract information and knowledge. A concept is introduced for a transition from the current perception of data as passive objects (DPO) to a new perception of data as active subjects (DAS). This transition would greatly increase data usage and exploitation, and support the extraction of knowledge from data products. Enabling the data subjects to actively reach out to potential users would revolutionize data dissemination and sharing and facilitate collaboration in user communities. The three core elements of the transformative DAS concept are: (1) “intelligent semantic data agents” (ISDAs) that have the capabilities to communicate with their human and digital environment. Each ISDA provides a voice to the data product it represents. It has comprehensive knowledge of the represented product including quality, uncertainties, access conditions, previous uses, user feedbacks, etc., and it can engage in transactions with users. (2) A knowledge base that constructs extensive graphs presenting a comprehensive picture of communities of people, applications, models, tools, and resources and provides tools for the analysis of these graphs. (3) An interaction platform that links the ISDAs to the human environment and facilitates transaction including discovery of products, access to products and derived knowledge, modifications and use of products, and the exchange of feedback on the usage.

6863274,"Evaluating Forest Protection Strategies: A Comparison Of Land-Use Systems To Preventing Forest Loss In Tanzania","Understanding the effects of forest management strategies is especially important to avoid unregulated natural resource extraction that leads to ecosystem degradation. In addition to the loss of crucial forest services, inefficiencies at converting these natural resources into economic gain for people ultimately exacerbates poverty. Therefore, it is important to know which conservation strategies have proven to be effective in preventing ecosystem degradation and thus be encouraged in future management plans. Here, we used a high-resolution remotely sensed dataset spanning 15 years to study forest cover dynamics across various protected areas in Tanzania. Our findings highlight particular management approaches more effective in preventing forest cover loss and promote forest cover gain, and provide valuable information for conservation efforts. Results show that National Parks have the least forest cover loss, whereas multiple-use Game Controlled Areas have the highest rates of forest loss. In fact, results suggest that these multiple use areas tend to lose more forest cover than areas with no protection or management status at all. These findings suggest the need for more effective strategies for enforcing the existing policies to ensure that socio-economic benefits to local communities are maximized and national interests are sustained.","{""Hopcraft, J.

6903567,"Integration Of Urban Growth Modelling Products With Image-Based Urban Change Analysis","Urban change detection using remotely sensed data has been extensively studied. One current application of detection products is the formulation of calibration data for urban change prediction models. As multi-temporal scenes become available and urban growth prediction models increase in popularity and accuracy, it is natural to envisage a bi-directional relationship where, in addition to detection products assisting prediction models, the prediction information acts as ancillary input to enhance spectral-based change detection products. This closed feedback loop has the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of both detection and prediction efforts. Consequently, our objective is to evaluate the integration of prediction information with spectral data for urban change monitoring. A case study was carried out in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Probabilities of urban change generated from two existing urban prediction models (based on decision trees and logistic regression) are combined as additional information content with a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene. Detailed assessments at the pixel and block scales are implemented to evaluate urban change classification accuracy using different input data and training sample sizes. Results show that in pixel-based assessments, the fusion of decision tree change probabilities and TM spectral bands with sufficient training samples leads to improvements. In terms of overall accuracies, the improvement is 2.02.4\%, from 87.3\% (spectral-only model) and 87.7\% (prediction probability model) to 89.7\% for the fused model. Similarly, the corresponding kappa coefficients show increases of 0.070.08, from 0.60 for the spectral model and 0.61 for the urban prediction model to 0.68 for the fused model. Accuracies aggregated at the block scale present an approximate 2.14.3\% increase when the fusion-based model is employed compared with the exclusive use of either spectral or prediction probability data, namely 87.6\% (fused) vs 83.4\% (spectral) and 85.7\% (prediction). It is also important to state that the standard deviation of accuracies between blocks is significantly reduced by more than 3\% (11.5\% vs 14.9\% and 14.7\%), suggesting higher consistency in classification performance. This is a desirable attribute for subsequent use of these products, for example by the urban planning community. Statistical tests at the block scale also demonstrate that such improvements are significant. It is also observed that to receive the integration benefits, the remote sensing classifier needs a large but reasonable training data set size, while the prediction model should be based on advanced modelling methods. Further assessments on block accuracy with respect to urbanization conditions (i.e. urban presence and change sizes) indicate the ability of the fusion to address spectral limitations, especially in blocks with high relative change. These initial results encourage the expansion of spectral/prediction data fusion to other sites, modelling techniques, and input data.",NA,"10.1080/01431161.2013.791760",2024-10-01 17:28:49,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863398,"Integrating New Technologies To Broaden The Scope Of Northern Spotted Owl Monitoring And Linkage With Usda Forest Inventory Data","Wildlife monitoring programs designed to inform forest management and conservation decisions in the face of climate change benefit from long-term datasets with consistent methodology. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs may seek to transition to alternative methods because emerging technologies can improve trend tracking and expand the number of target populations, increase spatial scale, and reduce long-term costs. Integrated models strengthen the capacity to adapt long-term monitoring programs to next generation methods. Here we present a case study of northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population monitoring that is under transition. The first monitoring phase focused on territory occupancy and mark-resighting individual owls. Owing to rapidly declining populations and increasing costs, traditional methods are less viable for long-term monitoring. A non-invasive approach, passive acoustic monitoring, is effective for detecting spotted owl presence, estimating occupancy rates, distinguishing sex, detecting trends in populations, and monitoring many additional species. A key component to support transition to passive acoustic monitoring was the development of machine learning models to automate species detections that enable rapid and effective data processing and analysis workflows. Coupling passive acoustic monitoring networks with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) datasets provide powerful tools for predicting forest change impacts on wildlife populations and identify winners and losers in dynamic landscapes. The second monitoring phase will leverage new technologies, expand the scope of inference, link forest inventory and remote sensing datasets, and transition the program to broad biodiversity monitoring that assists managers as they face myriad challenges in dynamic landscapes.","{""Jenkins, Julianna M.

6903655,"An Adaptive Method For Identifying Marine Areas Of High Conservation Priority","Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14 species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress. Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3 primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human activities, and alterations in the marine environment.",NA,"10.1111/cobi.13154",2024-09-26 00:59:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

In this study, regression Kriging with environmental predictors was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil nutrients (organic matter and total nitrogen) in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, considering the disadvantages of conventional geo-statistic methods. Terrain and vegetation indicators were chosen for regression Kriging including ten terrain attributes and one vegetation index. The results indicated that relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), roughness of terrain (QFD), rate of gradient (SOS) and NDVI had significant correlations with soil organic matter and total nitrogen. M and Ψ had higher significant correlation with soil organic matter than those with total nitrogen. Relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), surface roughness (M), river dynamic index (Ω) and NDVI were the best predictors for describing soil nutrients in the study area for they described the regression equations most. In Nong'an County, the soil organic matter and total nitrogen distributed regularly from southeast to northwest, and the values were higher in the part of southeast.

Ongoing advancements in techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping and extracting FCC information require a thorough evaluation of their validity and reliability. The primary objectives of this study are to: (1) create a large-scale forest FCC dataset with a 1-meter spatial resolution, (2) assess the regional spatial distribution of FCC at a regional scale, and (3) investigate differences in FCC areas among the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) and U.S. Forest Service Tree Canopy Cover products at various spatial scales in Arkansas (i.e., county and city levels). This study utilized high-resolution aerial imagery and a machine learning algorithm processed and analyzed using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to produce the FCC dataset. The accuracy of this dataset was validated using one-third of the reference locations obtained from the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) dataset and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery with a 0.6-m spatial resolution. The results showed that the dataset successfully identified FCC at a 1-m resolution in the study area, with overall accuracy ranging between 83.31% and 94.35% per county. Spatial comparison results between the produced FCC dataset and the Hansen et al., 2013 and USFS products indicated a strong positive correlation, with R2 values ranging between 0.94 and 0.98 for county and city levels. This dataset provides valuable information for monitoring, forecasting, and managing forest resources in Arkansas and beyond. The methodology followed in this study enhances efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, as it enables the processing of large-scale datasets with high computational demands in a cloud-based environment.

The study aims to develop series of LULC maps of urban areas of Ranchi, India and was studied during the years 1989 and 2015. It predicts LULC changes using geospatial tools such as remote sensing and GIS. Various satellite imagery datasets such as Landsat TM, ETM? and Landsat 8 OLI of years 1989, 2002 and 2015 were used to analyze urban LULC, which was later used to predict for 2015 and 2028 using Markov transition matrix and was cross-validated with true LULC of 2015. The urban area growth was found 11\% more than the predicted value. Slope map was also generated from digital elevation model and urban expansion in 2015 was 67\% and with respect to roads it was 60\% within 1 km road buffer in 2015 over 2002. Regression equation was developed over decadal population of 1961-2011 to estimate it for years 1989, 2002, 2015 and 2028. The population has increased 102\% in 2015 over 1989. However, Markov predicted 43\% more urban expansion for year 2028 over 2015.

Methods A retrospective chart review collected data from veterans with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that participated in the DSMES-HTK program at 2 Veterans Affairs Northeast Ohio Healthcare System facilities between February 2013 and December 2018. A factorial design was used to compare A1C data and use of clinical video telehealth from main hub to satellite site. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 25). Repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) were performed to compare mean A1C in veterans that attended HTK at the main site versus a telehealth site. RMANOVA was also used to compare mean A1C in veterans that attended at least 1 hands-on class versus those that attended at least 1 demonstration class. Results A1C values of all groups improved over time and were sustained regardless of DSMES-HTK delivery method or location. Conclusions Sustained improvement in A1C was observed in patients that participated in both DSMES-HTK in person and via clinical video telehealth classes conducted by hub site facilitator with RDN, CDCES credential. The use of a clinical video telehealth strategy for DSMES-HTK capitalizes on limited, highly skilled, credentialed instructional team members.","{""Aoun, Arianna"",""Burant, Christopher"",""Byrne, Cally"",""Cross, Samantha"",""Julius, Mary"",""Kurmas, Neal"",""Utech, Anne""}","10.1177/26350106211004887",2024-10-03 17:47:02,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2021,"{}",NA
6863629,"An Identification Study On Field-Derived Spectra Of Grassland Combustibles And Soil Based On Fractal Theory","Grassland fire disaster is an important influence factor to grassland ecological system in China. Therefore, it is crucial to study on the monitoring, prediction and management of grassland fire. Remote Sensing (RS) provides detailed data and saves a lot of manpower, material resources and financial resources on the research of grassland fire. However, it is difficult to identify the grassland fuel and soil with Remote Sensing. In this paper, we introduced fractal into the spectral analyses of the field-derived spectra (FDS) of grassland fuel and soil to solve the problem above. The study area laid on the Westward of Changling, Jinlin province, China. Study subjects included soil and dominant species: Leymus chinensis, Reed, Chloris virgate, Kalimeris integri folia and Artemisia mongolica. FDS of study subjects were measured with ASD FS3 and continuums of FDS were calculated by Matlab 2010. Meanwhile, Box-counting values of FDS and continuums were calculated by Matlab 2010. According to the spectral and continuum analysis, it is difficult to identify soil, Leymus chinensis, Reed, Chloris virgate, and Artemisia mongolica because of the similar spectral curves. However, the Artemisia mongolica can be identified for the strong reflection. For typical fractal characteristics of FDS and continuum, clustering analyses of study subjects were done according to box-counting values of FDS and continuum. The results of clustering analyses show that Box-counting values of FDS and continuum are important indexes to identify the study subjects. This study provides a new thought to identity the grassland combustibles and soil with Remote Sensing.","{""Luo Xiao-long"",""Tong Zhi-jun"",""Zhang Ji-quan"",""Zhao Yun-sheng""}","10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)08-2553-05",2024-07-18 22:36:15,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2016,"{}","{""Grassland fire; Fractal; Box-counting; Continuum removed""}"
6863592,"An Improved Actor-Critic Algorithm In Continuous Spaces With Action Weighting","Classic reinforcement learning algorithms mainly aim at the discrete state and action spaces. For the complex environment or the more applicable continuous spaces, the methods for the discrete spaces cannot satisfy the requirement. One feasible method is to discretize the state and action spaces, then the methods applied in discrete spaces can solve these problems with continuous state and action spaces. However, the reasonable discretization for the state and action spaces is not an easy problem. The methods applicable in continuous spaces do not have to discretize the state or action spaces, but most of them did not consider the constraint of the action range, additionally, the fluctuations of the optimal action were heavily. To be more applicable in continuous action spaces, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action space based on weighting of the actions by considering the constraint of the action range and decreasing the fluctuation, called AW-PS-AC. AW-PS-AC is designed in the framework of the actor-critic which is a classic method for the continuous space. The action exploration policy takes the Gaussian distribute by using the optimal action as the mean value, so that the selective action is the action with a small exploration factor. The optimal state value function and the optimal policy are approximated by linear function approximation, where the gradient descent method is utilized to update one set of the value function parameter and two sets of the policy parameters. The two sets of the policy parameters are weighted to obtain the optimal policy to constraint the optimal action, so that the optimal action will not surpass the action range and the optimal policy will not fluctuate significantly. The weighting for the actions can satisfy the constraint of the action range. Moreover, the samples can be utilized more comprehensively, resulting in a better performance under only a small amount of the data. To speed the convergence rate, an improved temporal difference algorithm is designed, where the temporal difference error (TD-error) of the value function are employed to update the optimal policy and the policy eligibility trace is introduced to improve the convergence rate for the algorithm. To prove the convergence of this proposed method, under the three given assumptions, AW-PS-AC is analyzed theoretically and its convergence is proved. On two classic benchmarks of the classic reinforcement learning benchmarks which have the nonlinear system dynamics, pole-balancing problem and puddle world problem, AW-PS-AC is compared with the representative methods which are representative in continuous spaces, namely, continuous actor-critic learning automaton (CALAC), continuous-action on Q-learning (CAQ) and incremental natural actor-critic with scaling gradient (INAC-S), and they are implemented on them. The results show that the AW-PS-AC algorithm performs well in the two experiments. The good performances in the two experiments demonstrate that the AW-PS-AC algorithm can solve the approximated-optimal problems effectively in continuous space. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, AW-PS-AC outperforms them not only in convergence but also in stability. From the experiments, it is clearly that AW-PS-AC algorithm can converge only after only a few episodes, moreover, it can be stable all the time after it is converged. © 2017, Science Press.

6862939,"Response Of Vegetation Coverage To Climate Change In Mongolian Plateau During Recent 10 Years","Vegetation in the arid/ semi arid area is highly sensitive to climate change. The Mongolian Plateau climate is mainly controlled by the east Asia monsoon system. Hence both Inner Mongolia and the state of Mongolia (Hereafter: Mongolia) experience a similar arid/semi arid climate but have different anthropological influences via their separate social and economic development histories. In this study, we analyzed in-situ observations from 67 meteorological stations (50 stations in Inner Mongolia and 17 in Mongolia) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) product from SPOT (Satellite pour l') observation de la Terre in French) using Mann-Kendall (MK) tests and Maximum Value Composition (MVC). Our results showed that: (1) Temperature is general higher in the south than the north, while precipitation ranges from low in the west to high in the east. There is a significant warming trend over the whole Mongolian Plateau region from 1961 to 2009, while no obvious trends were found for precipitation; (2) Vegetation coverage in Inner Mongolia was generally greater than that in Mongolia. The time series of vegetation coverage change in these two regions can be divided into two periods. The regional averaged NDVI decreased from 1998 to 2001, fluctuated greatly and then increased continuously from 2009 to 2012. The main degraded areas are located in the Xilingol league, central Inner Mongolia, while they are mostly located in the central and western Mongolia; (3) Positive correlations were found between NDVI and precipitation in desert, steppe vegetation and forest areas in Mongolia, while negative relationships were found for temperature. In Inner Mongolia, NDVI are also positively correlated with precipitation in desert and steppe vegetation areas and also positively correlated with temperature in forests. Recently several major national ecological projects were implemented in Inner Mongolia by national central and local governments, including ""The Return Cropland to Forest"", the ""Return Grazing Land to Grassland"" (Grain for Green), and the Three North Protection Forest Plantation Project. These projects improved the local environment by stopping grazing/ cropping and planting trees. We believe that these policy actions contribute to the vegetation recovery in Inner Mongolia exhibited here in the NDVI. We attribute the different trends and dynamics of vegetation change in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia to human activities since the climate is similar in these two areas. However, the mechanism driving the changes requires further study particularly investigation of the socio-economic drivers of local land use changes. If formal/ informal communication between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia are encouraged in scientific research, cultural exchange and policy making of environmental protection at different levels, it will provide more opportunity for preservation and enhancement of the nomadic culture.","{""Cui, X."",""He, B."",""Jiang, C."",""Liu, Q."",""Miao, L."",""Zhu, F.""}","10.5846/stxb201304100659",2024-09-30 17:21:50,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{""Climate change"",""Inner Mongolia"",Mongolia}"

6863631,"Planning Of Multi-Station Accessing Multi-Satellite Based On Physical Planning","With the increase of on-orbit satellites, there is an urgent need for effective supervision of many satellites. It is necessary to study how to reasonably allocate and schedule limited ground resources to satellite access. An assignment and planning method for multi-station accessing multi-satellite is proposed based on physical planning. The accessing window assignments of the ground facilities to the satellites are used as the design variables, the adjacent window's minimum interval of the same ground facility and the maximum accessing number of a ground facility are considered as the constraints, and the end time of the task, the access benefit based on success rate and the access cost are designed as the objective functions, and then an accessing and planning model of multi-station incompletely accessing multi-satellite with the consideration of the cost and the benefit is established. A single objective function is reasonably mapped from the multiple objective functions by physical programming, and the differential evolution algorithm is used for optimization. The proposed method is applied to solving a small-scale problem with three stations and four satellites and a large-scale problem with 20 stations and 96 satellites. The case's results show that the proposed method can obtain the solution of trade-off of multi-objective preference in line with the constraints.

6863124,"Devices To Support Treatment Decisions In Type 1 Diabetes: The Diabeo System","Blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes has improved considerably since the DCCT due to general diffusion of 'physiological' basal-prandial therapeutic schedules, generalization of therapeutic educational programs, functional insulin therapy, insulin analogues, and insulin pumps. However, glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) averages 8% within various studies, which is still unsatisfactory. The creation of new technological tools could lead to new levels of success, as attested by the Diabeo system. This system comprises three programs. The first program automatically calculates basal and prandial insulin doses while taking account of blood glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, and is equipped with algorithms that allow automatic adjustment based on the results obtained. The entire system must first of all be configured by the doctor according to the patient's characteristics, and then it has to be downloaded to a smartphone from a secure website. All of the patient's results and data are then made available for consultation at all times by authorized caregivers, enabling remote monitoring to be performed. The second program analyzes the results and automatically generates coaching messages for the patient and messages for the caregiver in the event of underuse, unsatisfactory results, or inadequate operation of the system. The caregiver may then intervene in a timely fashion via a telephone consultation or modification of the patient's treatment profile. The third program optimizes the doctor's available time by delegating tasks and allowing action to be undertaken by a specialized telemedicine nurse working in conjunction with the responsible diabetologist. An initial version of the system, comprising only the first of these three programs, resulted in a mean reduction in HbA 1c of 0.9% at 6 months versus the control group in a population of patients with chronic glycemic control problems and treated with multiple injections or insulin pump. Analysis of individual patient data shows that the most compliant patients derived the greatest benefit from the dose calculation function, while less compliant patients benefited considerably from the telemonitoring function, which allowed short but repeated consultations at opportune moments. A large-scale national study is currently being initiated in France to confirm these favorable metabolic results at 1 year and to assess the medicoeconomic impact of this system after 2 years of use. Ultimately, the results may lead to granting of reimbursable status for the Diabeo system by the French national social security authorities, followed by widespread use of the system in France and international availability. © 2015 S.

6903641,"A Conceptual Framework For The Governance Of Multiple Ecosystem Services In Agricultural Landscapes","ContextWhile the concept of ecosystem services (ES) is well established in the scientific and policy arenas, its operationalization faces many challenges.

After detailing our CF, we use a case study to illustrate how methods from different disciplines can be combined to operationalize our CF.ResultsThe literature suggests that the landscape level is likely to be the level of organization that will make it possible to (i) integrate different components of ES co-production, i.e. ecological processes, agricultural practices and social structures, (ii) understand interactions between stakeholders, including ES co-producers and beneficiaries, (iii) explicit ES trade-offs, i.e. social choices between ES.ConclusionThe production of multiple ES at the landscape level involves different types of interdependencies among ES co-producers and beneficiaries.

6903616,"A Statistical Approach To Mapping Flood Susceptibility In The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region","Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between different region types; for each region flood risk factors were extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and included several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood susceptibility. Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding. Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1, respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope, land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor. An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk factor's influence on flooding in a subregion. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very high risk (80-100\%). It was observed that several areas classified as very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require additional flood risk mitigation.",NA,"10.1029/2018wr023018",2024-10-01 17:23:46,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863706,"Remote Monitoring Of Inhaled Bronchodilator Use And Weekly Feedback About Asthma Management: An Open-Group, Short-Term Pilot Study Of The Impact On Asthma Control","Objective: Adequate symptom control is a problem for many people with asthma. We asked whether weekly email reports on monitored use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators might improve scores on composite asthma-control measures. Methods: Through an investigational electronic medication sensor attached to each participant's inhaler, we monitored 4 months' use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators. Participants completed surveys, including the Asthma Control TestTM (ACT), to assess asthma control at entry and monthly thereafter. After the first month, participants received weekly email reports for 3 months. The reports summarized inhaled bronchodilator use during the preceding week and provided suggestions derived from National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines. Paired t-tests and random-effects mixed models were implemented to assess changes in primary asthma endpoints. Results: Thirty individuals participated in the 4-month study; 29 provided complete asthma control information. Mean age was 36.8 years (range: 19-74 years); 52% of respondents were female. Mean ACT scores were 17.6 (Standard Deviation [SD] = 3.35) at entry and 18.4 (SD = 3.60) at completion of the first month. No significant difference appeared between ACT values at entry and completion of the first month (p = 0.66); however, after participants began receiving email reports and online information about their inhaler use, mean ACT scores increased 1.40 points (95% CI: 0.61, 2.18) for each subsequent study month. Significant decreases occurred in 2-week histories of daytime symptoms (β = -1.35, 95% CI: -2.65, -0.04) and nighttime symptoms (β = -0.84, 95% CI: -1.25, -0.44); no significant change in activity limitation (β = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.69, 0.26) was observed. Participants reported increased awareness and understanding of asthma patterns, level of control, bronchodilator use (timing, location) and triggers, and improved preventive practices. Conclusions: Weekly email reports and access to online charts summarizing remote monitoring of inhaled bronchodilator frequency and location were associated with improved asthma control and a decline in day-to-day asthma symptoms.","{""Magzamen, S."",""Morrison, T."",""Truelove, S."",""van Sickle, D.""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0055335",2024-10-03 21:48:58,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2013,"{}","{""Administration, Inhalation"",Adult,Aged,Asthma,""Asthma Control Test"",""Bronchodilator Agents"",Demography,Feedback,Female,Humans,Male,""Middle Aged"",""Monitoring, Physiologic"",""Pilot Projects"",""Remote Sensing Technology"",Telemedicine,""Treatment Outcome"",""Young Adult"",article,awareness,""bronchodilating agent"",""clinical article"",""disease control"",ethnicity,""feedback system"",""health care organization"",""health care utilization"",human,""open study"",""patient monitoring"",""pilot study"",""practice guideline"",""preventive medicine"",questionnaire,""race difference"",""rating scale"",""short acting drug"",""treatment response""}"
6863162,"Non-Timber Forest Products And Environmental Valuation Of The National Forest Pacotuba, Es","This study aimed to evaluate the potential for the extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and environmental valuation by the willingness to receive from the residents of the damping zone of the National Forest (FLONA) of Pacotuba, state of Espírito Santo. Forms were applied in a sample of 78 families, in the community of Monte Alegre, located in the damping zone of the FLONA de Pacotuba, for the NTFPs ethnobotanical survey and the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. The mapping use of the soil Pacotuba FLONA and the damping zone were obtained through a Landsat image. The contingent valuation method was used using the forms to estimate the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. At FLONA de Pacotuba there is potential to produce NTFPs, with an offer mainly for medicinal and ecological purposes. The use of the soil demonstrates that the FLONA of Pacotuba presents a high percentage of forest cover, however the damping zone is with a high percentage of pasture and use of the soil Anthropic, with the payment for environmental services (PES) an alternative to increase the forest cover in the cushioning zone. The willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover of the owners in the damping zone and in the FLONA was greater than the PES of the state of Espírito Santo, which hinders the adoption of a payment program for environmental services. The PES of Espírito Santo, through the program Reflorestar, associated with the management of NTFPs, mainly medicinal and ecological, would be alternatives for income generation and preservation of the forest cover. © 2019 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

6863367,"Rapid Assessment Of Plant Diversity Using Modis Biophysical Proxies","The spectral information derived from satellite data provides important inputs for assessing plant diversity. If a suitable satellite-derived biophysical proxy is applicable to assess and monitor plant diversity of different biogeographic regions will be of interest to policy makers and conservationists. We selected four biogeographic regions of India, i.e., semi-arid, Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, and Northeast as the test sites on the basis of variations in moisture availability. The flora data collected for the study sites are the extract of the national biodiversity project 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level'. The available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived biophysical proxies at high temporal frequencies was considered to compare the biophysical proxies: surface reflectance-red and near-infrared, normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, enhanced vegetation index-EVI, leaf area index-LAI, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation-FAPAR at different temporal scales (monthly, post-monsoon, seasonal, annual) in each selected biogeographic regions of India. Generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) were utilized to evaluate the relationship between plant diversity and MODIS-derived biophysical proxies. MARS summarized the suitable biophysical proxies at monthly scale in descending order for the total forest area in semi-arid was red, NDVI, and FAPAR; for Eastern Ghats was EVI, FAPAR, and LAI; for Western Ghats was EVI, LAI, and FAPAR; and for Northeast was NDVI, near-infrared, and red. Furthermore, monthly FAPAR commonly found to be the suitable proxy to large scale monitoring of plant diversity in the moisture varied biogeographic regions of India, except Northeast. Using artificial neural network, the relationship of plant diversity and monthly FAPAR/NDVI were modeled. The correlation between the predicted and reference plant diversity was found to be r = 0.56 for semi-arid, r = 0.52 for Eastern Ghats, r = 0.52 for Western Ghats and r = 0.61 for Northeast at p-value < 0.001. The study affirms that FAPAR is potentially an essential biodiversity variable (EBV) for carrying out rapid/indicative assessment of plant diversity in different biogeographic regions, and thereby, meeting various international commitments dealing with conservation and management measures for biodiversity.","{""Behera, Mukunda Dev"",""Mahanand, Swapna"",""Roy, Partha Sarathi""}","10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114778",2024-07-19 20:42:41,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{calibration}","{""Artificial neural network; Biogeographic regions; <p>Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active ""}"
6863486,"Characterization Of Water Use And Water Balance For The Croplands Of Kansas Using Satellite, Climate, And Irrigation Data","Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states in the United States, where agricultural irrigation is a primary user of underground and surface water. Because of low precipitation and declining groundwater levels in western and central Kansas, sustainable management of irrigation water resources is a critical issue in the agricultural productivity of the state. The objective of this study is to analyze and characterize the water use and water balance in the croplands of Kansas using satellite observations, meteorological data, and in situ irrigation water use records. We used actual evapotranspiration (ETa), precipitation, soil moisture, and irrigation water use to calculate water balance for Kansas in 2015 at scales of counties, climatic divisions, and groundwater management districts (GMD). The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model was implemented to estimate 30-m resolution ETa. Results showed that the seasonal (May - September) precipitation, soil water storage change, and ETa are 528 mm, 80 mm, and 555 mm, respectively, on average of all croplands in the state. The annual net irrigation water consumption was 293 mm for irrigated croplands, indicating that irrigation water constitutes an substantial portion of the water supply in the state. The total volumetric irrigation water use was 3.24 km3 for all croplands within five GMDs in western and south-central Kansas, while only 0.38 km3 was outside of GMDs. The multiple regression models of ETa against precipitation and irrigation water use were statistically significant with R2 values of 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, at county and climate division scales. Regression models also indicated a higher rate of ETa response to irrigation water use than that to precipitation. Our study demonstrated the spatial patterns of crop water use and water balance in Kansas, which could provide useful information for management of irrigation agriculture and water resources for the state.","{""Boiko, Olena"",""Friedrichs, MacKenzie"",""Ji, Lei"",""Schauer, Matthew"",""Senay, Gabriel B.""}","10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107106",2024-07-19 23:52:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""Evapotranspiration; Irrigation water use; Landsat data; Soil water storage; SSEBop model; Water use ""}"
6863029,"Object-Based Mapping Of Aboveground Biomass In Tropical Forests Using Lidar And Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Data","Developing countries that intend to implement the United Nations REDD-plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, and the role of forest conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) framework and obtain economic incentives are required to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks based on the IPCC guidelines. In this study, we developed a method to support REDD-plus implementation by estimating tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by combining airborne LiDAR with very-high-spatial-resolution satellite data. We acquired QuickBird satellite images of Kampong Thom, Cambodia in 2011 and airborne LiDAR measurements in some parts of the same area. After haze reduction and atmospheric correction of the satellite data, we calibrated reflectance values from the mean reflectance of the objects (obtained by segmentation from areas of overlap between dates) to reduce the effects of the observation angle and solar elevation. Then, we performed object-based classification using the satellite data (overall accuracy = 77.0\%, versus 92.9\% for distinguishing forest from non-forest land). We used a two-step method to estimate AGB and map it in a tropical environment in Cambodia. First, we created a multiple-regression model to estimate AGB from the LiDAR data and plotted field-surveyed AGB values against AGB values predicted by the LiDAR-based model (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 38.7 Mg/ha), and calculated reflectance values in each band of the satellite data for the analyzed objects. Then, we created a multiple-regression model using AGB predicted by the LiDAR-based model as the dependent variable and the mean and standard deviation of the reflectance values in each band of the satellite data as the explanatory variables (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 42.8 Mg/ha). We calculated AGB of all objects, divided the results into density classes, and mapped the resulting AGB distribution. Our results suggest that this approach can provide the forest carbon stock per unit area values required to support REDD-plus.","{""Furuya, Naoyuki"",""Hirata, Yasumasa"",""Kajisa, Tsuyoshi"",""Leng, Chivin"",""Ma, Vuthy"",""Mizoue, Nobuya"",""Ota, Tetsuji"",""Pak, Chealy"",""Saito, Hideki"",""Sokh, Heng""}","10.3390/rs10030438",2024-07-17 21:48:35,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{calibration}","{""aboveground biomass; airborne LiDAR; emission factor; object-based approach; REDD-plus; tropical for""}"
6903474,"Local 3d Scene Fine Detection Analysis Of Circular Landform On The Southern Edge Of Dinosaur Valley","With the continuous advancement of low-altitude UAV (unmanned air vehicle, UAV) technology for the earth observation and its wide popularity, UAV photogrammetry and SfM (Structure from Motion, SfM) methods have received more and more attention as the latest means to obtain true 3D realistic models of the survey area. As the newest means of measuring geomorphological information, UAV low-altitude photogrammetry and SfM methods can quickly obtain a true 3D realistic model of the survey area, and have been applied to a number of research fields. In this paper, the UAV is used to measure the typical local scene of annular landform at the southern edge of Dinosaur Valley in Lufeng, and the high-resolution geomorphological image data of the investigated area are obtained. Combined with the SFM method, a realistic 3D scene model is constructed, and its geomorphological characteristics are discussed and analyzed. The experimental results show that the DSM (digital surface model, DSM) data based on the SFM method can obtain ground points by filtering, diluting, and classifying the data, and the DEM (digital elevation model, DEM) data with a resolution of 0.2m is constructed by using the progressive encrypted triangular mesh method, which can accurately represent the true geomorphological characteristics of the study area. (2) Construction of three typical elevation profiles of the circular scene “inner-middle-outer,” and comparative analysis of the profiles confirmed that the topography of the study area is characterized by the dome ridge line AA' as the main highland ridge line, showing a circular “basin margin” pattern, with gradually decreasing elevations on the inner and outer sides. (3) In order to reveal the complex tectonic geomorphological features of the external scene between the ridge and trough, the ArcGIS surface analysis method was used to extract the ridge lines J1-J7. Accurate quantitative measurements and analysis were carried out to investigate the slope, slope length, slope direction, ridge area face, and other related parameters. (4) Using the multi-view visual interpretation and typical scene analysis of the three-dimensional 3D model, micro-geomorphological features such as the development of washouts in the survey area and the nodal laminar surface of the geological body can be clearly identified. In addition, the coordinates of the geological body’s spatial location and its production, spreading area, square volume, and other rich geological information can be accurately obtained. Through the above experimental study on the detection of 3D scenes of landforms, the advantages of UAV measurement technology and SFM method to construct DSM data and 3D scene models in fine geological structure detection are demonstrated. This will have an important application prospect and practical value for geological survey, monitoring , prevention and control management in mountainous areas.In addition, the fast, low-cost, high-precision, and non-contact measurement mode can provide accurate data basis and technical support for geological structure detection, geological disaster investigation, risk assessment and prevention and control management. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",NA,"10.1007/s12517-021-08101-3",2024-10-01 17:23:03,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862967,"Estimation Of Surface Moisture Content Using Sentinel-1 C-Band Sar Data Through Machine Learning Models","Monitoring the spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture content (SMC) of the surface soil layer is essential for agriculture and water resource management activities, especially in regions where the socio-economic condition and livelihood depend upon agriculture and allied sectors. In the present study, we have compared different machine learning (ML) and linear regression models to estimate the SMC integrating field observed soil moisture and Sentinel-1 SAR data. Total 56 soil samples were collected from the surface soil layer (similar to 5 cm) in correspondence with the passing date of the Sentinel-1 sensor over the study area. The surface SMC was estimated for bare soil areas, which was extracted by applying the threshold values on vegetation and water index maps derived from the Sentinel-2 multispectral data. The univariate linear regression with the co-polarized VV band provided higher accuracy compared to the cross-polarized VH band. However, the multiple linear regression with VV and VH bands indicated similar accuracy as obtained by the VV band alone. The random forest model was observed as the best performing ML model for soil moisture estimation (R-2 = 0.87 and 0.93 during modeling and validation, respectively; RMSE: similar to 0.03). The obtained results indicate well accurate surface soil moisture verified with in-situ information collected during the dry rabi crop season (January to March 2019). The maximum SMC was observed for March, followed by February and January, that corroborated with the total monthly precipitation and irrigation activities. The study highlights the potentiality of ML models and Sentinel-1 SAR data for soil moisture estimation, which is useful for policy-level implications and decision making in agriculture and water resource management activities.","{""Das, Pulakesh"",""Datta, Subhadip"",""Dutta, Dipanwita"",""Giri, Rakesh Kr.""}","10.1007/s12524-020-01261-x",2024-07-17 18:08:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{calibration}","{""Soil moisture; Sentinel-1; Random forest; Regression""}"

Research and operational implementations of ALS data have highlighted their value for characterizing forest structure and generating spatially explicit and objective spatial coverages and mapping products for forest management. Continued emphasis to enhance forest stewardship is promoting novel methods to integrate ALS to detail non-timber ecosystem values like habitat, soil, and water. Standardized criteria and indicator frameworks such as the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers provide a reliable starting point for where ALS has opportunities to characterize ecosystems objectively regardless of location. In this review of primarily Canadian work, we highlight how ALS is becoming an increasingly viable technology for deriving meaningful indicators to meet sustainable forest management criteria. We review and highlight the value of ALS for quantifying indicators of biological diversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil and water, and the role of forests in global ecological cycles. We conclude by highlighting the need for increased education, tech transfer, flexible software, and reporting frameworks alongside five key considerations for using ALS to derive meaningful indicators of sustainable forest management.","{""Coops, Nicholas C."",""Fournier, Richard"",""Frizzle, Catherine"",""Furze, Shane"",""Goodbody, Tristan R.

6863686,"What Rainfall Does Not Tell Us-Enhancing Financial Instruments With Satellite-Derived Soil Moisture And Evaporative Stress","Advanced parametric financial instruments, like weather index insurance (WII) and risk contingency credit (RCC), support disaster-risk management and reduction in the world's most disaster-prone regions. Simultaneously, satellite data that are capable of cross-checking rainfall estimates, the standard dataset to develop such financial safety nets, are gaining importance as complementary sources of information. This study concentrates on the analysis of satellite-derived multi-sensor soil moisture (ESA CCI, Version v04.2), the evapotranspiration-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) rainfall estimates in nine East African countries. Based on spatial correlation analysis, we found matching spatial/temporal patterns between all three datasets, with the highest correlation coefficient occurring between October and March. In large parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, we observed a lower (partly negative) correlation coefficient between June and August, which was likely caused by issues related to cloud cover and the volume scattering of microwaves in sandy, hot soils. Based on simple linear and logit regression analysis with annual, national maize yield estimates as the dependent variable, we found that, depending on the chosen period (averages per year, growing or harvesting months), there was added value (higher R-squared) if two or all three variables were combined. The ESI and soil moisture have the potential to close sensitive knowledge gaps between atmospheric moisture supply and the response of the land surface in operational parametric insurance projects. For the development and calibration of WII and RCC, this means that better proxies for historical and potential future drought impact can strengthen drought narratives, resulting in a better match between calculated payouts/credit repayment levels and the actual needs of smallholder farmers.","{""Anderson, Martha"",""Enenkel, Markus"",""Farah, Carlos"",""Hain, Christopher"",""Osgood, Daniel"",""Wagner, Wolfgang"",""White, Andrew"",""You, Liangzhi""}","10.3390/rs10111819",2024-07-16 23:25:24,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""remote sensing; soil moisture; evapotranspiration; drought; disaster risk management; weather index ""}"
6903563,"Mangrove Health Index As Part Of Sustainable Management In Mangrove Ecosystem At Karimunjawa National Marine Park Indonesia","Background: Monitoring the health of marine ecosystems is an integral part of sustainable management of the ecosystems including mangrove. Distribution and diversity of mangrove ecosystems are two important parameters in Mangrove Health Index (MHI). The index analyses value of mangrove density, diversity, index of similarity and the number of mangrove species. Method: This study investigates mangrove distribution and diversity. Mangrove distribution maps were prepared using Satellite imagery GEO-EYE. Ecological surveys to analyze the diversity of mangrove at five locations, namely Legon Cilik, Legon Gede, Kemujan, Karimunjawa and Menjangan Besar. MHI was calculated by assigning weight for each parameter, multiplied by each parameter score and then summing all of multiplication results value. Results: Satellite image interpretation results showed that mangroves were found at island of Karimunjawa, Menjangan Besar and Sintok. In total, 22 mangrove species identified, 12 species were true mangroves and the rests were mangrove associates. Rhizophora apiculata dominates three of nine survey locations, while Rhizophora stylosa was the dominant species in two of nine locations and the rest are dominated by Ceriops tagal, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia alba. Density of mangrove in the category of tree, mangrove average density ranging from medium to high, from 230 to 1060 ind/ha. In the category of sapling, dominant mangrove species was relatively diverse. In general, the Shannon diversity index was low, it means that mangrove diversity is low, it means that mangrove diversity is low. Mangrove in Legon Cilik 1 and Menjangan Besar had the highest Shannon diversity index (1,09) while Karimun 1 were the lowest (0,18). Conclusion: The value of MHI at Karimunjawa was 200, which is in the medium category. The results suggest that there is a need to improve MHI as part of sustainable management based on the distribution and diversity of mangrove.",NA,"10.1166/asl.2017.9155",2024-09-26 01:07:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862731,"Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Risk Assessment Using Remote Sensing And Hydrodynamic Modeling: A Case Study Of Satluj Basin, Western Himalayas, India","Glacier-associated hazards are becoming a common and serious challenge to the high mountainous regions of the world. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are one of the most serious unanticipated glacier hazards, with the potential to release a huge amount of water and debris in a short span of time, resulting in the loss of lives, property, and severe damage to downstream valleys. The present study used multi-temporal Landsat and Google earth imageries to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamism of the selected glacial lake (moraine-dammed) in the Satluj basin of Western Himalayas. Furthermore, GLOF susceptibility of the lake was assessed using a multi-criteria decision-based method. The results show that the lake area has increased from 0.11 to 0.26 km(2) over the past 28 years from 1990 to 2018. The susceptibility index value for the lake was calculated as 0.75, which indicates that the lake is highly susceptible to the GLOF. The depth and volume of the lake were estimated to be 16 m and 57 x 10(5) m(3), respectively, using an empirical formula. HEC-RAS, HECGeo-RAS, and Arc-GIS software were utilized in this study to perform unsteady flow analysis and to determine the GLOF impact on the downstream area. The worst-case GLOF scenario (breach width of 75 m) was revealed during an overtopping failure of the moraine dam, resulted in a peak discharge of 4060 m(3)/s and releasing a total water volume of 57 x 10(5) m(3). The breach hydrograph has been routed to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of peak flood, inundation depth, velocity, water surface elevation, and flood peak arrival time along the river channel. The analysis further reveals that the routed flood waves reach the nearest settlement, i.e., Rajpur town, situated at a distance of 102 km in the downstream valley of the lake at 6 h after the beginning of the lake breach event with a peak discharge/flood of 1757 m(3)/s and maximum flow velocity of 1.5 m/s. With the ongoing climate warming and glacier retreat, moraine-dammed lakes are becoming more hazardous and thus increasing the total threat. Therefore, it is mandatory to monitor and assess such lakes at regular intervals of time to lessen the disastrous impacts of GLOFs on the livelihood and infrastructure in the downstream valleys. The findings of this study will aid in the creation of risk management plans, preparatory tactics, and risk reduction techniques for GLOF hazards in the region.","{""Ahmed, Rayees"",""Jain, Sanjay Kumar"",""Lohani, Anil Kumar"",""Rawat, Manish""}","10.1007/s11356-023-25134-1",2024-09-30 02:12:06,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Glacier recession; Glacial lake expansion; GLOF susceptibility; Glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF""}"
6691616,"The economic value of geological information: synthesis and directions for future research","Geological information can play a key role in addressing challenges of sustainable development such as land degradation and groundwater protection, and contribute to improved decision-making processes. In this paper we: (a) provide a review of previous research on the economic value of geological information and other earth observations as well as related products, services and infrastructure; and (b) identify important lessons from this work as well as methodological challenges that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research shows significant economic benefits attached to the generation of this type of public information. The value of geological information has typically been measured in terms of avoided costs. Still, it is difficult to compare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning which sectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in their treatment of potential (rather than only existing) users, and employ varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future research should devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of this type of information, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing the role of potential users. A number of specific methodological challenges also deserve further scrutiny in future research, such as the use of discount rates and benefit-transfer approaches.

In the environment, erosion, landslide, floods, water pollution, illegal solid waste disposal, damaged drainage structures with disconnected parts, clandestine sewage or effluent discharge, among others, can be cited as impacts of urbanization. In this context, watersheds can be used as a foundation for urban development with certain scales of prioritization. In literature, the discussion for watershed prioritization was mostly found based only on computational methods and models, and does not include the important influence of field investigation and analysis of the headwaters. This is an option for urban areas, since most urban rivers are considered as headwaters (order 1). Also, erosion and poorly managed drainage systems can be obstructed by vegetation and may not be seen from satellite images. The aim of this work was to integrate on a GIS environment a Rapid Environmental Impact Assessment Matrix analysis with data based on basin morphology and field investigation of vegetation, erosion, drainage infrastructure, and presence of solid waste and wastewater in the urban headwaters of a medium size city in Brazil to create an urban watershed management prioritization order. A field survey was carried in 27 urban headwaters and digital analysis of the physical characteristics of the watersheds was using the QSWAT+ tool with SRTM data, land cover and use by MapBiomas and pedology by ITCG. Results showed that higher levels of prioritization (lowest value of the environmental score – es) were most related to poorly managed vegetation, drainage structure problems and urbanization, for example headwaters 2b (es = −390), 3b (es = −330), 4a (es = −354), 5b (es = −346) and 5c (es = −322).

In order to meet the observational requirements of many societal benefit areas, a series of EO systems have been launched in both polar and geo synchronous orbits. Starting from Bhaskara, the first experimental EO satellite in 1979 to Cartosat-1 successfully launched in May 2005, a large number of sensors operating in optical and microwave spectral regions, providing data at resolutions ranging from 1 km to a meter have been built and flown. Data reception and processing facilities have been established not only in the country but also at various international ground stations. Remotely sensed data and its derived information have become an integral component of the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS), a unique concept evolved and established in the country.

6862920,"Ensemble Three-Dimensional Habitat Modeling Of Indian Ocean Immature Albacore Tuna (Thunnus Alalunga) Using Remote Sensing Data","This study evaluated the vertical distribution of immature albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the Indian Ocean as a function of various environmental parameters. Albacore tuna fishing data were gathered from the logbooks of large-sized Taiwanese longline vessels. Fishery and environmental data for the period from 1998 to 2016 were collected. In addition to the surface variable, the most influential vertical temperature, dissolved oxygen (OXY), chlorophyll, and salinity layers were found at various depths (i.e., 5, 26, and 53 m for SST; 200, 244, and 147 m for OXY; 508, 628, and 411 for SSCI; and 411, 508, and 773 m for SSS) among 20 vertical layers based on Akaike criterion information value of generalized linear model. Relative to the 20 vertical layers base models, these layers had the lowest Akaike information criteria. For the correlation between the standardized and predicted catch per unit effort (CPUE), the correlation values for the generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and random forest (RF) model were 0.798, 0.832, 0.841, and 0.856, respectively. The GAM-, BRT-, and RF-derived full models were selected, whereas the GLM-derived full model was excluded because its correlation value was the lowest among the four models. From March to September, a higher immature albacore standardized CPUE was mainly observed from 30°S to 40°S. A northward shift was observed after September, and the standardized CPUE was mainly concentrated at the south coast of Madagascar from November to January. © 2022 by the authors.","{""Lee, M.

6903555,"Review Of Remote Sensing-Based Methods For Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation: Progress, Challenges, And Prospects","Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for elucidating the global carbon cycle and the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,"10.3390/f14061086",2024-09-26 00:43:50,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863182,"Improved Radar Composites And Enhanced Value Of Meteorological Radar Data Using Different Quality Indices","Radar measurements are inherently affected by various meteorological and non-meteorological factors that may lead to a degradation of their quality, and the unwanted effects are also transferred into composites, i.e., overlapping images from different radars. The paper was aimed at answering the research question whether we could create ‘cleaner’ radar composites without disturbing features, and if yes, how the operational practice could take advantage of the improved results. To achieve these goals, the qRad and qPrec software packages, based on the concept of quality indices, were used. The qRad package estimates the true quality of the C-band radar volume data using various quality indices and attempts to correct some of the adverse effects on the measure-ments. The qPrec package uses a probabilistic approach to estimate precipitation intensity, based on heterogeneous input data and quality-based outputs of the qRad software. The advantages of the qRad software are improved radar composites, which offer benefits, among others, for aviation meteorology. At the same time, the advantages of the qPrec software are manifested through improved quantitative precipitation estimation, which can be translated into hydrological modeling or climatological precipitation mapping. Beyond this, the developed software indirectly contributes to sustainability and environmental protection—for instance, by enabling fuel savings due to the more effective planning of flight routes or avoiding runway excursions due to information on the increased risk of aquaplaning. © 2021 by the authors.

6862875,"Estimation Of Forage Mass In A Mixed Pasture By Machine Learning, Pasture Management And Satellite Meteorological Data","Measuring forage mass (FM) in the pasture, prior to grazing, is critical to determining the daily allocation of forage in pastoral animal production systems. FM is estimated by cutting forage in known areas, using allometric equations, or with the use of remote sensors (RS); however, the accuracy and practicality of the different methods for estimating FM is variable. The objective was to obtain predictive models using environmental and pasture management variables to predict FM. Regression models were fitted to estimate FM based on variables of pasture management (PM) or measurements obtained by RS, such as reflectance, air temperature, and rainfall. A mixed pasture grazed by beef cattle was studied for three years. With 80 % of data, models were built by ordinary least squares (OLS) or by machine learning (ML) algorithms. The remaining 20 % of the data was used to validate the models using the coefficient of determination and average bias between estimated and observed values. The base model of study was the relationship between pasture height before grazing and FM, this model was fitted using OLS; the r2 was 0.43. When models that included PM variables were fitted, the r2 was 0.45 for OLS and 0.63 for ML. When fitting models with PM and RS variables, the r2 was 0.71 for OLS and 0.96 for ML. ML-fitted model ensembles reduced the bias of FM estimates of the examined pasture. Overall, ML models better represented the relationship between pasture height before grazing and FM than OLS models, when fitted with pasture management variables and RS information. ML models can be used as a tool for daily decision-making in pastoral production systems. © 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

6691741,"Weather impacts on natural, social and economic systems","The EU project Weather Impacts on Natural, Social and Economic Systems (WISE) has analysed impacts of current climate variability to evaluate the sensitivity of today's society to extreme weather. Unlike studies of anticipated impacts of climate change, WISE did not rely on scenarios and projections, but on existing and newly collected data. The research involved (i) the statistical modelling of meteorological and sectoral time series, aimed at quantifying the impacts of changing weather variables on sector output, (ii) a population survey, aimed at investigating public perception of and behavioural response to unusually hot and dry summers and mild winters, and (iii) a management survey, aimed at obtaining insight into managers' awareness and perception of the importance of extreme weather on their operations. The three activities revealed a wealth of data and information, providing relevant insights into Germany's sensitivity to and perception of extreme weather events. Sectors that were analysed included agriculture, outdoor fire, water supply, human health, electricity and gas consumption and tourism. It appears from the statistical modelling that extreme weather can have impressive impacts on all sectors, especially when expressed in monetary terms. However, weather variability is generally considered a manageable risk, to which sectors in Germany appear reasonably well-adapted. The population and management surveys reveal both positive and negative impacts of extreme weather. People generally respond to these impacts by adjusting their activities. The utilities (electricity, gas and water) indicate that they are robsut to the current level of weather variability and do not consider climate change an important threat to their operations. The tourism sector experiences impacts but typically takes a reactive approach to adaptation, although it is also developing weather-insensitive products.","{""Flechsig, Michael""}","https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20108456",2024-04-26 22:55:03,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2000,"{}","{""ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES|WEATHER|SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS|CLIMATIC CHANGE|AGRICULTURE| FORESTS|HEALTH HA""}"
6862899,"Assessing Canal Seepage And Soil Salinity Using The Electromagnetic Remote Sensing Technology","Canal seepage and soil salinity are two major problems in irrigated areas of California's Central Valley, USA. Seepage is very common throughout the vast network of irrigation canals found in California. Most of these canals are earthen structures, where seepage contributes to the loss of millions of litres of water annually. Salinity problems are attributed to saline parent material, clayey soils, intensive irrigation, shallow water tables, and inadequate drainage that prevents the leaching of soluble salts. Several irrigation management practices, including sequential reuse of drainage waters within farm boundaries, are currently being tested in the region. Such practices are expected to reduce drainage volume, conserve irrigation water, and contribute to soil reclamation. Canal seepage and soil salinity can be assessed very accurately using the electromagnetic (EM) remote sensing technique. When coupled with a GPS and data logging capabilities, a mobilized EM system can provide automated and geo-referenced measurements over large areas. The study objectives were to locate seepage along irrigation canals and assess soil salinity in agricultural fields using the EM approach. Calibration of the EM data was performed following soil sampling. Samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity, texture, and moisture. Surface maps describing spatial distribution of these parameters were generated using GIS. The study suggested that the location of seepage could be detected rapidly and cost-effectively with the EM meter. The salinity assessment survey indicated that soil salinity levels ranged from 1 to 39 dS/m, with high spatial variability observed in most areas. Elevated salinity values were associated with poor drainage management. Growers and water agencies can utilize information from this study to develop water management and conservation strategies.","{""Cassel S, F."",""Zoldoske, D.""}","10.2495/si060071",2024-07-17 17:07:13,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2006,"{}","{California,""Canal seepage"",""Central Valley"",Drainage,""Electromagnetic induction"",""North America"",""Soil salinity"",""United States"",calibration,canal,""drainage water"",""electrical conductivity"",""electromagnetic method"",""management practice"",""remote sensing"",salinity,seepage,""water management""}"
6903543,"Spatio-Temporal Changes In Urban Green Space In 107 Chinese Cities (1990-2019): The Role Of Economic Drivers And Policy","Urban green space (UGS) has gained increasing attention due to its environmental and social functions. However, the compound effects of climate change, population growth and economic development on UGS are largely unknown. We selected 107 medium-sized and large cities in China to investigate dynamics in the spatial pattern of UGS in relation to government policy and other drivers based on remote sensing data for the period 1990 to 2019. To explore the effect of different levels of urbanization on changes in green space, we develop a new Normalized Urban Development Index (NUDI) to classify urban-suburban-rural gradients, viz. Long-term Builtup, New Built-up and Non-Built-up. Then, we analysed changes over time in the annual peak value of fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) for 380,000 cloud-free Landsat images, and regional UGS dynamics were evaluated using the proposed Regional Greenness Dynamic Index (RGDI). Finally, to reveal the major driver(s) of changes in UGS and estimate the extent to which patterns of urban greening are due to differences in economic development, we compared the observed UGS spatio-temporal dynamics with data on several climatic, social-economic and land use related factors for the same period. The NUDI are shown to be highly effective in mapping urban development gradients, with overall accuracy in the identified classes of 89\%. Annual maximum FVC analysis indicates that there was significant greening between 1990 and 2019 in both the long-term built up (10,667.52 km(2)) and the non-built up areas (529,310.47 km(2)), while there was a major increase in browning (25,110.43 km(2)) in the newly built-up areas. The RGDI results indicate that 65\% (71/107) of long-term built-up areas in cities trended greener over 2010 to 2019 under consideration. At the whole city scale, RGDI is negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), although when considering the long-term built-up areas only, economic growth exhibits a significant positive correlation during 2010 to 2019 (R = 0.62, p < 0.01). This study offers important insights as to the patterns of change in urban greening extent over time and its underyling drivers across urban-suburbanrural gradients against the background of urban expansion, afforestation, climate change and economic development.",NA,"10.1016/j.jag.2021.102525",2024-09-27 22:43:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863025,"'Tidy' And 'Messy' Management Alters Natural Enemy Communities And Pest Control In Urban Agroecosystems","Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice-woodchip mulching-on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a ""lazy gardener"" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.","{""Egerer, Monika"",""Philpott, Stacy M.""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0274122",2024-07-18 21:16:46,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2022,"{}",NA

6863022,"Accuracy Of Estimated Crop Evapotranspiration Using Locally Developed Crop Coefficients Against Satellite-Derived Crop Evapotranspiration In A Semiarid Climate","Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is measured or estimated using different methods, and its accuracy is critical for water management under precision agriculture. The objective of this study was to compare maize ETa estimated by the two-step approach using a locally developed crop coefficient curve with satellite-retrieved evapotranspiration by six models incorporated in the OpenET to identify the best evapotranspiration estimation alternatives to the two-step approach for water management in northern New Mexico. Maize (Zea mays L.) was planted at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center at Farmington from 2017 to 2022 and uniformly managed across years. Water management in plants was based on maize's actual evapotranspiration estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration and the local crop coefficient, which is described as a third-order polynomial function of the accumulated heat units by maize plants. For the same growing seasons, maize ETa was retrieved from satellite, and was estimated by six models listed within the OpenET from 2017 to 2022. The results show that maize daily ETa was consistently smaller when measured by SIMS and PT-JPL during maize initial and actively growing stages, while ETc(kc), SIMS and eeMETRIC showed similar maize daily ETa during maize full canopy development and mid-season, and which overcome the evapotranspiration estimated by DisALEXI, PT-JPL, geeSEBAL, and SSBop. ETc(kc) drastically dropped and became the lowest value among all ETa estimation models after the first fall snow or the first killing frost. Regarding the seasonal average, all six models included in OpenET showed smaller maize evapotranspiration. Maize seasonal evapotranspiration varied from 589.7 to 683.2 mm. eeMETRIC compares most similarly to the ETc(kc) model, followed by SIMS, with percent errors of 2.58 and 7.74\% on a daily basis and 2.43 and 7.88\% on a seasonal basis, with the lowest MBE and RMSE values, respectively, and could be used as an alternative for maize actual daily evapotranspiration for water management in northern New Mexico. The results of this study could be used by water managers and crop growers to improve water management in the Four Corners region, using eeMETRIC for crop water use to improve water management and conservation under sustainable agriculture.","{""Djaman, Koffi"",""Koudahe, Komlan"",""Mohammed, Ali T.""}","10.3390/agronomy13071937",2024-07-17 00:03:54,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""crop evapotranspiration; crop coefficients; remote sensing; OpenET; maize""}"
6863403,"Ecological Structure Of A Tropical Urban Forest In The Bang Kachao Peninsula, Bangkok","Rapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests. © 2016 by the authors.","{""Dell, B."",""Sommeechai, M."",""Srichaichana, J."",""Thangtam, N."",""Wachrinrat, C.""}","10.3390/f9010036",2024-07-17 19:34:22,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{Bangkok,""Banks (bodies of water)"",Biodiversity,""Central Region [Thailand]"",""Chao Phraya River"",Conservation,""Dry evergreen forest"",""Ecological structure"",Ecology,Ecosystems,Floods,""Krung Thep Mahanakhon"",Monitoring,""Normalized difference vegetation index"",""Shannon-weiner indices"",""Stand structure"",""Stand structures"",Thailand,Tropics,""Urban forest"",""Urban forests"",""Urban planning"",""Urban restoration"",Vegetation,""environmental restoration"",management}"
6863598,"Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol: A Commercial System-Of-Systems To Incentivize Forest Restoration And Management","Forest carbon sequestration offsets are methodologically uncertain, comprise a minor component of carbon markets and do not effectively slow deforestation. The objective of this study is to describe a commercial scale in situ measurement approach for determination of net forest carbon sequestration projects, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM, to address forest carbon market uncertainties. In contrast to protocols that rely on limited forest mensuration, growth simulation and exclusion of CO2 data, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM is based on standardized methods for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy covariance, a meteorological approach integrating forest carbon fluxes. NEE is used here as the basis for quantifying the first of its kind carbon financial products. The DMFCP differentiates physical, project and financial carbon within a System-of-SystemsTM (SoS) network architecture. SoS sensor nodes, the Global Monitoring PlatformTM (GMP), housing analyzers for CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2,13CO214CO2) and greenhouse gases are deployed across the project landscape. The SoS standardizes and automates GMP measurement, uncertainty and reporting functions creating diverse forest carbon portfolios while reducing cost and investment risk in alignment with modern portfolio theory. To illustrate SoS field deployment and operation, published annual NEE data for a tropical (Ankasa Park, Ghana, Africa) and a deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA) are used to forecast carbon revenue. Carbon pricing scenarios are combined with historical in situ NEE annual time-series to extrapolate pre-tax revenue for each project applied to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares) of surrounding land. Based on carbon pricing of $5 to $36 per ton CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) and observed NEE sequestration rates of 0.48 to 15.60 tCO2eq acre−1 yr−1, pre-tax cash flows ranging from $230,000 to $16,380,000 across project time-series are calculated, up to 5× revenue for contemporary voluntary offsets, demonstrating new economic incentives to reverse deforestation. The SoS concept of operation and architecture, with engineering development, can be extended to diverse gas species across terrestrial, aquatic and oceanic ecosystems, harmonizing voluntary and compliance market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming. The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of invalidation intrinsic to estimation-based protocols such as the Climate Action Reserve and the Clean Development Mechanism that do not observe molecular CO2 to calibrate financial products. Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, constrained by Kyoto Protocol era processes, will benefit from NEE measurement avoiding unsupported claims of emission reduction, fraud, and forest conservation policy failure.

6863237,"Price Tagging On Urban Farming Benefit In The Context Of Ecosystem Services","Rapid urbanisation, along with urban poverty, leads to social and environmental challenges that require cities to improve their resilience. Urban farming is promoted as an essential strategy for improving cities’ resilience by providing ecosystem services, namely strengthening the community, improving the urban environment and saving energy. The research aimed to estimate urban farming benefits in the context of ecosystem services in the monetary unit. It took place in Malang City, East Java–Indonesia, as a case study. The study utilised the Total Economic Value framework in conjunction with the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity concept to develop and estimate indicators of urban farming benefit into valuation through the direct market and stated preferences approaches. The study employed field surveys, in-depth interviews and remote sensing analysis. Here we show for the first time that the Total Economic Value of urban farming benefits reached up to US$ 13.11 in a square metre annually if all urban farming forms occupy a square metre each.

6863131,"Mapping Oilfield Brine-Contaminated Sites With Mid-Spatial Resolution Remotely Sensed Data","An environmental problem associated with petroleum production is the disposal of brine, which is produced during petroleum exploration and production. Oilfield brine, if improperly handled, transported, and disposed of, can pose a serious threat to surrounding water resources, arable lands, and plant communities. Although field checking of known oilfield brine-contaminated sites is relatively straightforward, the ability to detect and inventory brine-contaminated sites over remote and expansive areas can be time consuming and expensive. A more efficient and cost-effective method is needed to delineate brine-contaminated sites accurately. The chief aim of this project was to test a remote sensing method to map accurately and quantify contaminated oilfield brine sites in west Texas. Landsat ETM+ data of west Texas were obtained, de-correlated with a three-band dataset using principal component analysis (PCA), and classified into brine and non-brine locations using supervised classification with a maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Results show the Landsat ETM+ data is effective in quantifying previously unknown oilfield brine-contaminated areas larger than 2 acres in west Texas. Overall map accuracy was 91.67%, users accuracy was 87.50% for brine-contaminated sites, and the kappa statistic was 82.35%. Once contaminated brine sites have been mapped via remote sensing, the spatial location and quantity of the sites can make land reclamation and restoration decisions more timely and cost-effectively compared to traditional ground surveys. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","{""Bowes, C."",""Farrish, K."",""Hung, I.

6903479,"Hybrid Rough-Pso Approach In Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis","Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a very challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always the key features for classifying mixed pixels. This paper proposes an approach for pixel classification using a hybrid approach of rough set theory and particle swarm optimization methods. Rough set theory deals with incompleteness and vagueness among data, which property may be utilized for detecting arbitrarily shaped and sized clusters in satellite images. To enable fast automatic clustering of multispectral remote sensing imagery, in this article, we propose a rough set-based heuristical decision rule generation algorithm. For rough-set-theoretic decision rule generation, each cluster is classified using heuristically searched optimal reducts to overcome overlapping cluster problem. This proposed unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on rough set generated membership values. This approach addresses the overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using rough set generated membership values. Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, inspired from the social behavior of bird flock. Therefore, to predict pixel classification of remote sensing imagery, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based membership correction approach over rough set-based initial decision rule generation. We demonstrate our algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of the catchment area of Ajoy River. The newly developed algorithm is compared with fuzzy C-means and K-means algorithms. The new algorithm generated clustered regions are verified with the available ground truth knowledge. The validity analysis is performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms with K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms.",NA,"10.1007/978-81-322-2544-7_10",2024-09-26 00:36:46,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{calibration,validation}",NA
6863459,"Multilevel Segmentation Algorithm For Agricultural Parcel Extraction From A Semantic Boundary","Parcels are the basic unit of crop planting and management. Therefore, parcelwise farmland data become the fundamental basis for precision agriculture applications, and the extraction of parcels from high-resolution remote sensing images is of great importance. The deep learning-based edge detection methods have achieved superior performance, but these methods output edge intensity maps with pixel values from 0 to 255 in raster format. Vectorization, which transforms the rasterized data into vectors, is an important post-processing procedures. In this process, segmentation and thinning are two key steps for deriving the one-pixel-wide binary edge, however, the traditional method suffers deviation from the actual edge and the unclosed edge. To address these problems, based on the hypothesis that the larger the edge intensity value is, the greater the likelihood that the pixel is on or near the boundary, we developed a multilevel segmentation method for agricultural parcel extraction from a semantic boundary, which prioritizes using the pixels with high intensity to ensure that the extracted boundaries adhere closely to the actual boundaries and the pixels with low intensity connect the unclosed boundaries, thus simultaneously improving the fidelity and completeness of boundaries. We selected images acquired in Hangzhou Bay and Denmark to test our method, and the result demonstrates that our method can accurately extract agricultural parcels. Compared with the single threshold segmentation method, our method shows higher boundary fidelity and completeness. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves competitive performance in traditional metrics but outperforms edge preservation and one-to-one correspondence between the extracted parcel and actual parcel. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","{""Chen, T."",""Chen, Y."",""He, Z."",""Wu, N."",""Wu, W."",""Yang, H.""}","10.1080/01431161.2023.2174386",2024-09-30 21:39:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Agricultural parcel extraction"",Agriculture,""Basic units"",China,Denmark,""Edge intensities"",Extraction,""Hangzhou Bay"",""Image segmentation"",Pixels,Plantings,""Precision Agriculture"",Rasterization,""Remote sensing"",""Segmentation algorithms"",""Segmentation methods"",""Semantic boundary"",Semantics,Zhejiang,algorithm,""edge detection"",""machine learning"",""multilevel segmentation"",""one-pixel-wide binary edge"",pixel,segmentation,vector}"
6863447,"High-Resolution Mapping And Driving Factors Of Soil Erodibility In Southeastern Tibet","Quantifying the spatial distribution of soil erodibility (K factor) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is essential for global soil erosion management. However, many K factor maps have a coarse spatial resolution at the regional scale, and high-resolution mapping is still a challenge. Quantitative analysis of the influence of environmental factors such as soil, topography, climate, and vegetation, and human activities on the K factor is also lacking. Therefore, we mapped the high-resolution (90 m) spatial distribution of the K factor values in southeastern Tibet using a random forest model with multiple environmental variables, based on remote sensing, ground obser-vations (114 sampling points), and gridded datasets. The K factor estimates based on soil particle size compo-sition and organic carbon content ranged from 0.09 to 0.35, showing moderate variation. The random forest model yielded a coefficient of determination > 0.9 and provided detailed information on the spatial distribution of K factor values, especially in large unsampled areas. The predicted K factor values tended to be high in the eastern area and low in the western area. Partial least squares path modeling showed that soil physical properties such as fractal dimension and mean weight diameter of aggregates had the largest influence on the K factor (path coefficient 0.695). Climate and topography also had a considerable influence on the K factor (path coefficient-0.489 and-0.469, respectively), while the influence of vegetation and human activities was minimal. Accordingly, the random forest model is an effective tool for high-resolution spatial distribution mapping of the K factor with limited sampling data.","{""Jiang, Yefeng"",""Liang, Bo"",""Liang, Wandong"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wan, Dan"",""Yu, Wu""}","10.1016/j.catena.2022.106725",2024-09-27 22:59:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2023,"{}","{""Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; Soil erodibility; Machine learning; Driving factors""}"
6863280,"Digital Surface Models For Gnss Mission Planning In Critical Environments","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) surveys performed in critical environments (e.g., urban canyons, mountainous areas, or areas of dense vegetation) usually suffer from a lack of satellite coverage as a result of obstacles such as buildings and vegetation. GNSS mission-planning software provides an estimate of satellite visibility and dilution-of-precision (DOP) values along a planned trajectory to establish the best time frame over which to perform the survey. However, such an estimate is not reliable in a complex scenario because the surrounding environmental morphology is not considered. This paper introduces a new method to improve the prediction of GNSS satellite visibility. This method involves computing GNSS satellites position by means of the orbital parameters, as well as using three-dimensional digital surface models (DSMs) to develop a more reliable mission plan. The time evolution of key parameters describing the GNSS constellation is computed by means of a visibility georeferenced map for both dynamic and static surveys.","{""Ackermann, S."",""Angrisano, A."",""Del Pizzo, S."",""Gaglione, S."",""Gioia, C."",""Troisi, S.""}","10.1061/(asce)su.1943-5428.0000119",2024-07-17 19:35:41,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{""Navigation; Geodesy; Digital cartography; Surveying""}"

However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007-2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production.",NA,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105788",2024-09-26 00:39:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6862772,"Analyzing The Relationship Between Historic Canopy Dynamics And Current Plant Species Diversity In The Herb Layer Of Temperate Forests Using Long-Term Landsat Time Series","Current plant species diversity of the forest herb layer is influenced by site conditions, seed banks, stand age and historic canopy dynamics, induced for example by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Long-term Landsat time series allow for analyzing forest canopy dynamics over several decades at a spatial resolution of 30 m. These dynamics have not been related to plant diversity in the herb layer of forests yet. Here, we related canopy layer dynamics of 132 one hectare temperate forest plots derived from Landsat time series (1985–2015) to herb layer plant species diversity observed in 2015. To quantitatively characterize the dynamics in the canopy over this period, we applied Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation representation (SAX) to yearly NDVI time series of the plots and calculated the frequency of the representations of similar time series patterns, hereafter called SAX-metrics. We used the SAX-metrics as predictors to estimate with beta regression models the Simpson's diversity index of the herb layer of our forest plots subdivided into six forest types. Models including SAX-metrics, describing abrupt decreases in NDVI, and high, medium, or low NDVI values had pseudo R2 between 0.13 and 0.63. We conclude that disturbances, canopy closure, as well as stand age, as represented in NDVI time series, influence the diversity in the herb layer in five of the six examined forest types. Our study shows that information on historic canopy dynamics, detected from Landsat time series, can contribute to a better understanding of current herb layer diversity in some forest types.

6659452,"Identifying Associations Between Management Practices And Antimicrobial Resistances Of Sentinel Bacteria Recovered From Bulk Tank Milk On Dairy Farms","There is increasing emphasis on the need to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU) on dairy farms to reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria which could compromise animal health and impact human medicine. In addition to AMU, the role of farm management is an area of growing interest and represents an alternative route for possible interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of farm management practices and AMU on resistances of sentinel bacteria in bulk milk. Dairy farms from two, geographically separate locations within the British Isles were recruited as part of two study groups. Farm management data from study group 1 (n = 125) and study group 2 (n = 16) were collected by means of a face-to-face questionnaire with farmers carried out during farm visits. For study group 2, additional data on AMU was collated from veterinary medicine sales records. Sentinel bacterial species (Enterococcus spp. and E. coli), which have been reported to be of value in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) studies, were isolated from bulk tank milk to monitor antimicrobial susceptibilities by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). MIC data for both groups was used to generate an overall ""score"" for each farm. For both groups, this overall farm mean MIC was used as the outcome variable to evaluate the impact of farm management and AMU. This was achieved through use of elastic net modelling, a regularised regression method which also featured a bootstrapping procedure to produce robust models. Inference of models was based on covariate stabilities and bootstrapped P-values to identify farm management and AMU practices that have significant effects on MICs of sentinel bacteria. Practices which were found to be of importance with respect to Enterococcus spp. included management of slurry, external entry of livestock to the dairy herd, use of bedding materials and conditioners, cubicle cleaning routines and antibiotic practices, including use of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Practices deemed to be of importance for E. coli MICs included cubicle and bedding management practices, teat preparation routines at milking and the milking procedure itself. We conclude that a variety of routine farm management practices are associated with MICs of sentinel bacteria in bulk milk. Amendment of these practices offers additional possible routes of intervention, alongside alterations to AMU, to mitigate the emergence and dissemination of AMR on dairy farms.","{""Bradley, Andrew"",""Dottorini, Tania"",""Giebel, Katharina"",""Green, Martin"",""Hyde, Robert"",""Leach, Katharine"",""McLaughlin, Daniel""}","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105666",2024-04-11 22:15:37,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2022,"{cco}","{""Dairy; Antimicrobial resistance; Farm management; Regularised regression; Bootstrap""}"
6863195,"Multifactor Colorimetric Analysis On Ph-Indicator Papers: An Optimized Approach For Direct Determination Of Ambient Aerosol Ph","Direct measurement of the acidity (pH) of ambient aerosol particles/droplets has long been a challenge for atmospheric scientists. A novel and facile method was introduced recently by Craig et al. (2018), where the pH of size-resolved aerosol droplets was directly measured by two types of pH-indicator papers (pH ranges: 0-2.5 and 2.5-4.5) combined with RGB-based colorimetric analyses using a model of G-B (G minus B) vs. pH2. Given the wide pH range of ambient aerosols, we optimize the RGB-based colorimetric analysis on pH papers with a wider detection range (pH ∼ 0 to 6). Here, we propose a new model to establish the linear relationship between RGB values and pH: pHpredict D a • Rnormal C b • Gnormal C c • Bnormal. This model shows a wider applicability and higher accuracy than those in previous studies and is thus recommended in future RGBbased colorimetric analyses on pH papers. Moreover, we identify one type of pH paper (Hydrion® Brilliant pH dip stiks, lot no. 3110, Sigma-Aldrich) that is more applicable for ambient aerosols in terms of its wide pH detection range (0 to 6) and strong anti-interference capacity. Custommade impactors are used to collect lab-generated aerosols on this type of pH paper. Preliminary tests show that, with a collected particle size range of ∼ 0.4-2.2 μm, the pH paper method can be used to predict aerosol pH with an overall uncertainty = 0.5 units. Based on laboratory tests, a relatively short sampling time (∼ 1 to 4 h) is speculated for pH prediction of ambient aerosols. More importantly, our design of the impactors minimizes potential influences of changed environmental conditions during pH paper photographing processes on the predicted aerosol pH. We further show that the routinely adopted way of using pH color charts to predict aerosol pH may be biased by the mismatch between the standard colors on the color charts and the real colors of investigated samples. Thus, instead of using the producer-provided color charts, we suggest an in situ calibration of pH papers with standard pH buffers. © 2020 Author(s).","{""Cheng, Y."",""Klimach, T."",""Kuhn, U."",""Li, G."",""Li, M."",""Ma, N."",""Pöschl, U."",""Su, H."",""Zheng, G.""}","10.5194/amt-13-6053-2020",2024-09-30 16:56:12,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Indicator indicator"",""aerosol composition"",instrumentation,optimization,pH,""remote sensing"",""satellite data""}"
6862814,"Modeling Of Gully Erosion In Ethiopia As Influenced By Changes In Rainfall And Land Use Management Practices","Gully erosion is one of the most extreme land degradation processes that exhibit spatial and temporal variation depending on topography, soil, climate, and land use and management characteristics. This study investigated the impact of changes in rainfall, land use/land cover (LULC), and land use management (LUM) practices on gully erosion in two midland watersheds (treated Kecha and untreated Laguna) in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia by using the LANDPLANER model in combination with intensive field measurements and remote sensing products. We simulated gully erosion under past (in 2005), present (in 2021), and three potential future curve number conditions, each time under four rainfall scenarios (10, 30, 60, and 100 mm) using the dynamic erosion index (e), static topographic (esp), and erosion channel (esp\_channel) thresholds. Density plot analyses showed that gullies frequently occur in low-lying gentle slope areas with relatively higher curve number values. The best predictions of gullies identified through true positive rates (TPR) and true negative rates (TNR) were achieved considering the static esp\_channel > 1 for Kecha (TPR = 0.667 and TNR = 0.544) and the dynamic e > 0.1 for 60 mm of rainfall in Laguna (TPR = 0.769 and TNR = 0.516). Despite the 10 mm rainfall having negligible erosion-triggering potential in both watersheds, the 60 and 100 mm rainfall scenarios were 4-5 and 10-17 times, respectively, higher than the 30 mm rainfall scenario. While the LULC change in the untreated Laguna watershed increased the impact of rainfall on gully initiation by only 0-2\% between 2005 and 2021, the combination of LULC and LUM significantly reduced the impact of rainfall in the treated Kecha watershed by 64-79\%. Similarly, the gully initiation area in Kecha was reduced by 28\% (from 33\% in 2005 to 5\% in 2021) due to changes in LULC and LUM practices, whereas Laguna showed little increment by only 1\% (from 42\% in 2005 to 43\% in 2021) due to LULC change. In addition, the future predicted alternative land use planning options showed that gully initiation areas in Laguna could be reduced by 1\% with only LULC conversion; 39\% when only LUM practices were implemented; and 37\% when both were combined. These results indicate that LUM practices outweigh the impact of LULC on gully erosion in the studied paired watersheds. Overall, LANDPLANER successfully simulated the spatio-temporal variation of gully erosion with scenario-based analyses and hence can be used to predict gullies in the study area and other data-scarce regions with similar agro-ecological settings.","{""Ardizzone, Francesca"",""Berihun, Mulatu Liyew"",""De Geeter, Sofie"",""Ebabu, Kindiye"",""Fenta, Ayele Almaw"",""Haregeweyn, Nigussie"",""Meshesha, Taye Minichil"",""Nzioki, Benedict"",""Rossi, Mauro"",""Setargie, Tadesual Asamin"",""Sultan, Dagnenet"",""Tsubo, Mitsuru"",""Tsunekawa, Atsushi"",""Vanmaercke, Matthias"",""Yibeltal, Mesenbet""}","10.3390/land12050947",2024-09-27 23:01:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""LANDPLANER; topographic threshold; GIS"",""RS; sustainable land management; land use/land cover; runoff curve number; dryland""}"

The end point change rate (EPR) and linear regression rate were used to study the coastline change rate, the fractal dimension of the coastline in the study area was analyzed, and the change of the type of coastal surface cover was analyzed by the transition matrix. The results show that: (1) Form 1990 to 2018, a significant trend of a continuous increase in the total length of coastline was observed with an increase of 181.08 km (43.18\%). In the study area, the coastline of Laizhou had the greatest change rate with an EPR value of 33.67 m/a, whereas the coastline of Laishan had the smallest change rate with an EPR value of 0.30 m/a. (2) Over the past 30 years, with the rapid economic development of Yantai and the ensuant urbanization, the total surface area of the coastal zone in the study area has increased by 144.94 km(2), mainly in the areas covered by structures and forests/grasses, by 112.96 km(2) and 96.08 km(2), respectively, while the areas of desert/bare land and water have decreased by 92.26 km(2) and 12.32 km(2), respectively.

6691512,"Linking Poverty-Based Inequalities with Transportation and Accessibility Using Mobility Data: A Case Study of Greater Maputo","Accessibility is widely considered as the most crucial benefit of any transportation system. Low accessibility may cause compromise on living conditions, low economic growth, high unemployment, social seclusion, and long-term social inequalities. In developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, surveys fail to keep up with the pace of rapid urbanization. Additionally, numerous location-based data sets, including mobile phone location data and Google Maps travel time, enable near-real-time observations of actively changing mobility dynamics. In this study, we use these novel data sets to assess various facets of accessibility and corresponding poverty-based inequalities within the Greater Maputo region in Mozambique. A data-based approach is seldom used in the Sub-Saharan African context. Consistent poverty-based inequalities in access to opportunities by driving, transit, and walking are observed. The transit system was ascertained to be more inefficient in the poorer regions. The richer regions witnessed most decreased access to opportunities because of high congestion. People living in the poorest regions were observed to travel much longer distances to access facilities than did those living in the richest regions. These differences were particularly significant for essential services of education, healthcare, and employment. These results can help urban planners and policymakers identify disadvantaged communities and develop policies to ameliorate the conditions. This assists in measuring the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and investigating areas of concern. Moreover, this study shows the applicability of various data sets and methods in a data-deprived scenario in Africa, and motivates more scholars and practitioners to partake in this technology leapfrogging.","{""Mattal, Shagun""}","https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981221116623",2024-04-28 00:50:44,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{data,""data science|big data analytics|policy"",""organization|data for decision-making|sustainability"",resilience|transportation,""society|transportation in the developing countries""}"

6863281,"Developing An Integrated Urban Ecological Efficiency Framework For Spatial Ecological Planning: A Case On A Tropical Mega Metropolitan Area Of The Global South","Rapid urbanization has emerged as one of the most critical challenges to ecological sustainability in urban areas. In developing countries, the degradation of the ecosystem is more prominent due to the lack of urban planning. Thus, it has become urgent for researchers to identify the ecological efficiency (EE) changes imposed by urban expansion and promote sustainable land use planning. This study aims to develop a comprehensive urban ecological efficiency (UEE) framework in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India, from 2000 to 2020. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to develop a remote sensing-based UEE index (UEEI) based on five effective ecological parameters (Greenness, Dryness, Heat, Wetness and vegetation health. A single sensitivity parameter was also calculated to determine the role of a single parameter based on which management strategies can be carried out. The findings showed that (i) there were substantial deteriorations of UEE in the last 20 years. In 2000 the areas with good EE were about 65.5\% which declined to 53.72\% in 2010 and 20.87\% in 2020. The areas with good UEE decreased 68\% and 61\% from 2000 to 2020 and 2010 to 2020, respectively; (ii) the areas with good UEE were 52\% in 2000, while 38\% in 2010. Most urban centres (Bhadreshwar, Champdani, Srirampur, Bally, Howrah, Kamarhati, Baranagar, Dum Dum, South Dum Dum, Rajarhat, Bidhannagar) located around the Kolkata megacity are characterized by poor and very poor EE (ranges of 0.60-1.00). Thus, spatiotemporal pattern of UEE could assist to clarify the administrative responsibilities as well as obligations.

6863582,"Are Patagonia Grasslands Being Overgrazed? A Response To Marino Et Al. (2020)","Based upon primary productivity estimates, Oliva et al. (2019) concluded that, at the end of last century and after long periods of overgrazing, Patagonia's domestic stocks adjusted to regional-scale herbivore carrying capacity. Populations of guanaco, a native camelid, increased thereafter, driving combined grazing pressures once again over carrying capacity in some areas. Marino et al. (2020) argued that grazing is not really at equilibrium because domestic stocks are concentrated in areas that remain overgrazed. They support the ideas that guanaco density is auto-regulated by resource-defence territoriality, and that guanacos are weak competitors with domestic stock, occupying only marginal areas. In their view, Oliva et al. (2019) put guanacos in the role of scapegoats, leaving domestic stocks unchecked. Equilibrium at regional scale does not preclude overgrazing and under-grazing at local scales. By separating areas with and without domestic stocks, Marino et al. (2020) estimated overgrazing at 28\% in Chubut Province and 73\% in Santa Cruz Province. Our recalculations show 28\% and 47\% domestic overgrazing, respectively. However, when combined with guanaco densities, these increase to 48\% for Chubut and 108\% for Santa Cruz. We question the hypothesised lack of competitive value and efficient self-regulating mechanisms that would prevent guanaco populations from overshooting carrying capacity. A dataset of 13 sheep farms showed mean density of 26 +/- 3.8 guanacos/km(2)and high combined grazing pressures. This was also observed in a protected area of Chubut that reached 42 guanacos/km(2)and crashed during drought, with 60\% mortality. Thereafter, guanacos increased to 70 guanacos/km(2), with recruitment rates that showed a complex response of density dependence but remained relatively elevated at densities above the estimated carrying capacity. Synthesis and applications. Marino et al. (2020) are right to question the apparent equilibrium of domestic stocks that are concentrated in areas that may be still overgrazed. But ground data show that guanaco populations have inefficient density population regulation and can reach densities well over carrying capacity, even in the presence of sheep. This does not mean that the main control should be on growing guanaco populations but it stresses our conclusion that joint management of the native-domestic herbivore system is urgently needed. Joint management can be effected through local plans, as current guanaco management permits can only be issued in areas that are not overgrazed by sheep. Farm management plans may in this way transform an apparent competitor into a valuable resource, complementary to sheep raising.","{""Cepeda, Carla"",""Ferrante, Daniela"",""Oliva, Gabriel"",""Paredes, Paula"",""Rabinovich, Jorge""}","10.1111/1365-2664.13753",2024-09-30 01:27:59,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""domestic-wildlife spatial segregation; guanacos; herbivore carrying capacity; herbivore competition;""}"
6691555,"Landsat in Contexts: Deconstructing and Reconstructing the Data-to-Action Paradigm in Earth Remote Sensing","There is a common theme at play in our talk of data generally, of digital earth data more specifically, and of environmental monitoring most specifically: more data leads to more action and, ultimately, to societal good. This data-to-action framework is troubled. Its taken-for grantedness prevents us from attending to the processes between data and action. It also dampens our drive to investigate the contexts of that data, that action, and that envisioned societal good. In this dissertation, I deconstruct this data-to-action model in the context of Landsat, the United States' first natural resource management satellite.  First, I talk about the ways in which Landsat's data and instrumentation hold conflicting narratives and values within them. Therefore, Landsat data does not automatically or easily yield action toward environmental preservation, or toward any unified societal good. Furthermore, I point out a parallel dynamic in STS, where critique is somewhat analogous to data. We want our critiques to yield action, and to guide us toward a more just technoscience. However, critiques- like data- require intentional, reconstructive interventions toward change. Here is an opportunity for a diffractive intervention: one in which we read STS and remote sensingthrough each other, to create space for interdisciplinary dialogue around environmental preservation. A focus on this shared goal, I argue, is imperative. At stake are issues of environmental degradation, dwindling resources, and climate change. I conclude with beginnings rather than endings: with suggestions for how we might begin to create infrastructure that attends to that forgotten space between data, critique, action, and change.","{""Fried, Samantha""}","https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/89431/Fried_SJ_D_2019.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=",2024-04-22 23:38:10,"excluded","{""Value is not measured"",""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{critique,Gerald}","{""Remote Sensing|interdisciplinary|satellites|data|multispectral scanner|environmental science|militar""}"
6863085,"Title: Ecological Relevance Of Least Cost Path Analysis: An Easy Implementation Method For Landscape Urban Planning","Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners. © 2019","{""Balbi, M."",""Croci, S."",""Ernoult, A."",""Georges, R."",""Madec, L."",""Nabucet, J."",""Petit, E.

6903565,"The Climate Adaptive Characteristics Of Urban Inside/Outside Water Bodies Based On Their Cooling Effect In Poyang And Dongting Lake Regions, China","Most publications have focused on the cooling effect of urban inside water bodies. However, the climate adaptive characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies is seldom studied. In this paper, three types of water bodies, i.e., urban inside water bodies, urban outside discrete water bodies and large water bodies are identified according to their relative spatial relationships with built-up areas. The climate adaptive landscape characteristics of water bodies are analyzed based on water bodies' cooling effect (WCE) inside and outside cities in the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake regions. Seventy-three Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images acquired from 1989 to 2019 are employed. Landscape scale characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies are described by area, water depth, perimeter to area ratio (PARA) and distance-weighted area index (DWAI). Three temperature-related parameters are calculated to estimate the WCE in different conditions. Climate adaptive characteristics of water bodies inside/outside cities are determined by corre-lation and regression analysis. Results show that: 1) The long river shape, depth, orientation and fluidity of urban inside water bodies are benefit to enhance their cooling effect; 2) the distance of urban outside water bodies from built-up areas are positive correlated with their cooling effect; 3) the optimal acreage of large water bodies are >2500 km2 and 1111-1287.5 km2 for climate adaption of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, respectively. Simultaneously, the WCE of urban outside large water bodies is related with human activities and climate conditions. The results of our study provide a significant contribution to blue-space planning in cities, and provide insights into actionable climate adaption planning in inland large lake areas.",NA,"10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15974",2024-10-03 21:46:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6691666,"The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS): supporting the needs of decision making in societal benefit areas","Earth observations can help reduce the loss of life and property from natural and human induced disasters through increasing our understanding of complex environmental systems. In this context, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is being built through the coordination of efforts within the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), comprised of 80 Member States, the European Commission and 58 Participating Organizations, established in February 2005. The 10-Year Implementation Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose and scope, expected benefits for nine “Societal Benefit Areas” (SBAs) (disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity), technical and capacity building priorities, and the GEO governance structure. The full value of GEOSS lies in its ability to integrate information across disciplines. Thus, GEOSS is concerned with: interlinking weather forecasting systems with other Earth observation systems; supporting efforts to advance sustainable energy; and devising end-to-end information services and sustained observing systems essential for addressing climate variability and change. The international collaborative framework of GEO allows: water experts to define the data and systems needed for improved water-cycle forecasting; international teams to monitor ecosystems and generate maps and other decision support tools; development of an Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems that will integrate in-situ and space data from multiple fields; and comprehensive monitoring critical to the conservation and sustainable use of the world’s biological diversity. In particular, in the field of water, unique regional cooperative approaches are now on-going and under planning for making maximum use of, and contributing to, GEOSS. The current GEO Work Plan furnishes the blueprint for activities to implement GEOSS, and provides concrete examples of how decision makers can use the data and services available through GEOSS to address major global opportunities and challenges. This is why GEO strives to develop a GEOSS that would serve the needs of all SBAs through interconnecting existing and future Earth observation systems, interlinking observation systems, and promotion of open data sharing.","{""Koike, Toshio""}","http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVIII/part8/pdf/GEO11_20100324010955.pdf",2024-04-22 02:39:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2010,"{}","{""GEOSS|GEO|Earth observation|societal benefit|decision making|data sharing|water cycle|satellite|remo""}"
6862979,"Changes In Coastal City Ecosystem Service Values Based On Land Use A Case Study Of Yingkou, China","The valuation of ecosystem services is intended to facilitate the rational and sustainable utilization of natural resources. However, calculating the values of natural resources is complex, and research is underway in this regard. The change of land use types can reflect the changes in the area of each ecosystem; therefore, in this study, land use changes in Yingkou (located in the south of Liaoning Province and an important port city) over a 10-year period (2004-2014) are assessed using a geographic information systems platform and the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Thematic Mapper remotely sensed images of the area. The Costanza calculation method and classification system are used to estimate changes in the total values of ecosystem services in the Yingkou area from 2004 to 2014 and to investigate the causes of these changes. The ""change tendency"" of particular ecological communities is calculated using the Variable coefficient, the Gini coefficient, and the Theil index. The results reveal the following: (i) The total value of ecosystem services in the Yingkou area decreased drastically (i.e., from \$2567.60 million to \$2127.26 million, representing a 17.2\% decline) between 2004 and 2014. (ii) Aquatic ecosystem services are valued greater than terrestrial services. In Yingkou, a decline in the value of aquatic ecosystem services accounts for 88.6\% of the total decrease in ecosystem service value. (iii) Land reclamation in the Yingkou urban area emerges as the primary factor influencing ecosystem service values for the various ecological communities in the region. The ecosystem service value of each ecological community is different, and the differences between the contributions made by the various communities to the total ecosystem services value are increasing over time. (iv) The decline in ecosystem service values in Yingkou is linked to urban development. Following widespread land reclamation, an increase in land area intended for urban construction is associated with a decrease in water area.","{""Feng, Yu"",""Guo, Xiaorong"",""Li, Ying"",""Peng, Fei""}","10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.021",2024-07-15 23:12:59,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""Ecosystem services; Resource valuation; Coastal city; Yingkou; China""}"
6863273,"Temporal And Spatial Variations Of Eco-Asset Patterns And The Factors Driving Change In The Wanjiang Demonstration Area","With the rapid development of the society and the economy, people are paying more attention to the value of natural resources and the benefits of the ecological environment. Evaluating the value of eco-assets has become a focus of concern. Quantitative remote sensing measurements, land data and other auxiliary data were used to measure the eco-assets in 46 regions of the Wanjiang Demonstration Area from 1990 to 2013. This paper analyzes temporal and spatial variations of eco-assets’ distribution, composition, change patterns and the factors driving variations. The results show that the distribution of eco-assets in the regions is very uneven, the central region has higher ecological assets than other regions, and it declined first and then rose during the period 1990-2013. The total amount of eco-assets increased by 3.05%. The change in the amount of ecological assets was not large, but it is important that the amount of assets was basically stable, and increases in the proportion of degraded areas was small. Grassland and water body eco-assets decreased by 11.19% and 0.66%, respectively, and that of cultivated land decreased by 15.54%, but forest land increased by 6.42%. As for the change pattern of ecological as-sets, the per capita assets of Hefei had the largest reduction, and those of Xuancheng the second largest. The spatial and temporal changes of ecological assets in the Wanjiang Demonstration Area include natural factors and human factors. The government's macro-control and economic policies are the main driving factors for the spatial and temporal changes of the ecological assets pattern. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

6666308,"Effects Of Land Use Changes On The Ecosystem Service Values Of A Reclamation Farm In Northeast China","Intensive agricultural development can change land use, which can further affect regional ecosystem services and functions. With the rapid growth of the population and the national demand for food, the northeast of China, which is located in the high latitudes, has experienced four agricultural developments since the 1950s. The original wetlands of this area were developed for farmland. The evaluation of ecosystem services is conducted to reveal the ecosystem status and variable trends caused by land reclamation. The aim of this study is to provide scientific basis for environmental management and for the sustainable development of agriculture in Northeast China. With GIS-RS technology, a typical farm was chosen to analyze variations in the ecosystem service value in response to land use changes during the study period. The total ecosystem service value of the farm decreased from 7523.10 million Yuan in 1979 to 4023.59 million Yuan in 2009 with an annual rate of -1.6 % due to the decreasing areas of woodland and wetland. The increased areas of cropland, water area and grassland partly offset the loss of the total value, but the loss was still greater than the compensation. Waste treatment and climate regulation were the top two service functions with high service values, contributing to approximately 50 % of the total service value. The spatial difference of the ecosystem service value also was analyzed. The wetlands located in the central and northeastern sections of the farm changed significantly. From the aspect of ecosystem service value, the wetland and water area should be conserved, as they have the highest value coefficients. The accuracy of the value coefficient, however, needs to be studied further in future research. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","{""Hao, F."",""Lai, X."",""Ouyang, W."",""Song, K."",""Wei, X."",""Xu, Y.""}","10.1007/s00267-012-9923-5",2024-04-11 22:04:33,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2012,"{cco}","{""Agricultural development"",Agriculture,""Annual rates"",China,""Conservation of Natural Resources"",Ecosystem,""Ecosystem service value"",""Ecosystem service values"",""Ecosystem services"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental management"",Farm,Farms,""Geographic Information Systems"",""High Latitudes"",""Land reclamation"",""Land use"",""Land-use change"",Northeast,""Northeast China"",""Population statistics"",""Rapid growth"",""Service functions"",""Spatial differences"",""Total values"",""Waste treatment"",""Water areas"",Wetlands,""accuracy assessment"",""agricultural land"",""alternative agriculture"",""conservation management"",""ecosystem service"",""future prospect""}"
6863370,"Flood Hazard In Wadi Rahbaa Area, Egypt","In the last decade, attention has been devoted to the southern part of the Egyptian Red Sea coast due to the large touristic and mining activities. Egypt spares no effort to develop it, to build new urban communities, and to create new job opportunities. Many comprehensive planning studies have been conducted. Many luxurious tourist spots, airports, and harbors have been constructed. These areas are subjected to flash floods, which represent a frequent threat to these urbanization activities that may cause losses in livelihood. By analyzing the geomorphologic features of the study area, intense stream networks are detected that, with the available metrological data, require flood management and analysis to mitigate the possible negative effects and to benefit from the estimation of flood water. Rahbaa basin is a sub-catchment of wadi Hodin. Flash floods within this area threaten the Red Sea coastal plain as well as the main coastal roads. It also directly drained out to the sea, which leads to a loss of huge amounts of flood water that is useful for arid regions. Using geographic information system and remote-sensing tools with the application of a comprehensive graphical modeling (watershed modeling system) supports the hydrological modeling of HEC-1. The total amount of runoff is calculated and the hydrograph of the 50-year return period is computed using rainfall historical data.","{""Alfy, S. Z."",""El Feel, A.

6862881,"Mapping Deciduous Broad-Leaved Forested Swamps Using Alos/Palsar Data","Accurate, updated information on the distribution of wetlands is essential for estimating net fluxes of greenhouse gases and for effectively protecting and managing wetlands. Because of their complex community structure and rich surface vegetation, deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps are considered to be one of the most difficult types of wetland to classify. In this research, with the support of remote sensing and geographic information system, multi-temporal radar images L-Palsar were used initially to extract the forest hydrological layer and phenology phase change layer as two variables through image analysis. Second, based on the environmental characteristics of forested swamps, three decision tree classifiers derived from the two variables were constructed to explore effective methods to identify deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps. Third, this study focused on analyzing the classification process between flat-forests, which are the most severely disturbed elements, and forested swamps. Finally, the application of the decision tree model will be discussed. The results showed that: 1) L-HH band (a L band with wavelength of 0-235 m in HH polarization mode; HH means Synthetic Aperture Radars transmit pulses in horizontal polarization and receive in horizontal polarization) in the leaf-off season is shown to be capable of detecting hydrologic conditions beneath the forest; 2) the accuracy of the classification (forested swamp and forest plat) was 81.5\% based on hydrologic features, and 83.5\% was achieved by combining hydrologic features and phenology response features, which indicated that hydrological characteristics under the forest played a key role. The HHOJ (refers to the band created by the subtraction with HH band in October and HH band in July) achieved by multi-temporal radar images did improve the classification accuracy, but not significantly, and more leaf-off radar images may be more efficient than multi-seasonal radar images for inland forested swamp mapping; 3) the lower separability between forested swamps dominated by vegetated surfaces and forest plat covered with litter was the main cause of the uncertainty in classification, which led to misleading interpretations of the pixel-based classification. Finally, through the analysis with kappa coefficients, it was shown that the value of the intersection point was an ideal choice for the variable.","{""Bian Hongfeng"",""He Chunguang"",""Sheng Lianxi"",""Yan Tingting"",""Zhang Zhengxiang""}","10.1007/s11769-016-0805-2",2024-09-30 17:24:15,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2016,"{}","{""forested swamp; Palsar radar images; forest hydrological characteristics; multi-temporal technique; ""}"
6691660,"Uncertainty and risk in wildland fire management: A review","Wildland fire management is subject to manifold sources of uncertainty. Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them.

6863639,"Changes In Wetland Landscape Patterns On Yinchuan Plain, China","Wetlands, with their many values and important functions, are precious resources. They have, however, undergone great changes during economic development and population growth. Relying on recent advances in remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, this paper probes changes in wetland landscapes on Yinchuan Plain during 1978-2006. A series of remote sensing images was used to identify wetland landscape types. Landscape pattern indices, such as patch number, patch density, landscape shape, and Shannon's diversity, evenness, and contagion indices were calculated with GIS and landscape analysis software. Changes in wetland landscape patterns on Yinchuan Plain were analyzed. The analysis show that the total area of wetlands on Yinchuan Plain decreased from 391,540,239 m2 in 1978 to 267,979,957 m2 in 2006, a significant change over 28 years. The area of rivers and lakes has shrunk, and the area of paddies has increased consistently, with increasing wetland fragmentation and heterogeneity. The number of patches, patch density, and landscape shape index shows that wetland landscape patterns have undergone great changes. The landscape diversity, landscape evenness, and contagion indices indicate that wetland landscapes have become less heterogeneous.

6863138,"Application Of Hybrid Model-Based Machine Learning For Groundwater Potential Prediction In The North Central Of Vietnam","Groundwater resources are required for domestic water supply, agriculture, and industry, and the strategic importance of water resources will only increase in the context of climate change and population growth. For optimal management of this crucial resource, exploration of the potential of groundwater is necessary. To this end, the objective of this study was the development of a new method based on remote sensing, deep neural networks (DNNs), and the optimization algorithms Adam, Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimization (AEO), Pathfinder Algorithm (PFA), African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to predict groundwater potential in the North Central region of Vietnam. 95 springs or wells with 13 conditioning factors were used as input data to the machine learning model to find the statistical relationships between the presence and nonpresence of groundwater and the conditioning factors. Statistical indices, namely root mean square error (RMSE), area under curve (AUC), accuracy, kappa (K) and coefficient of determination (R2), were used to validate the models. The results indicated that all the proposed models were effective in predicting groundwater potential, with AUC values of more than 0.95. Among the proposed models, the DNN-AVOA model was more effective than the other models, with an AUC value of 0.97 and an RMSE of 0.22. This was followed by DNN-PFA (AUC=0.97, RMSE=0.22), DNN-FPA (AUC=0.97, RMSE=0.24), DNN-AEO (AUC=0.96, RMSE=0.25), DNN-Adam (AUC=0.97, RMSE=0.28), and DNN-WOA (AUC=0.95, RMSE=0.3). In addition, according to the groundwater potential map, about 25-30\% of the region was in the high and very high potential groundwater zone; 5-10\% was in the moderate zone, and 60-70\% was low or very low. The results of this study can be used in the management of water resources in general and the location of appropriate wells in particular.","{""Bui, Quang-Thanh"",""Dang, Dinh Kha"",""Dang, Ngo Bao Toan"",""Du, Quan Vu Viet"",""Nguyen, Cong Tuan"",""Nguyen, Huu Duy"",""Nguyen, Quoc-Huy"",""Nguyen, Van Hong"",""Tran, Quang Tuan"",""Truong, Quang Hai""}","10.1007/s12145-023-01209-y",2024-07-17 19:44:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{}","{""Groundwater; DNN; Water ressources; Machine learning; Vietnam""}"

Groundwater has become important source of water supply for domestic use in Ghana. In the present study, sixty-five (65) constructed wells in the Dixcove Belt Granitoids (DBG) and Sandstone Mudstone Slate Carbonate (SMSC) geological formations of the Sekondi-Takoradi metropolis were investigated for their non-carcinogenic health risk state for children (0–6 years) and adults. The hazard index (HI) method was used as a measure of public health risk. The results indicated the HI values ranged from 4.58 × 10−2 to 111 × 10−2 and 18.5 × 10−2 to 226 × 10−2 for the adult category in the SMSC and DBG respectively. For the children category the HI values were 32.9 × 10−2 to 217 × 10−2 and 39.7 × 10−2 to 403 × 10−2 respectively. On individual well basis, 2.1% and 12.5% of wells have HI > 1 for adults in the SMSC and DBG respectively. In the children category the values were 29.2% and 50% respectively. Using the mean HI values, HI < 1 in both geological formations indicating no potential health risk to adults. However the mean HI > 1 for children (1.01 and 1.18 SMSC and DBG respectively) indicating a potential health risk. At the 95th percentile level, children were 66.79% and 64.28% more at risk than adults in the SMSC and DBG, respectively.

6862736,"Monitoring Water Quality With Remote Sensing Image Data","Water covers approximately 74% of the Earth’s surface, and it plays many important roles in the lives of all human being. Inland and coastal waters in particular have a direct interface with human society by providing value for food supplies, industrial uses, transportation, commerce, and human health (UNEP 2006). However, many water bodies have encountered severe environmental problems (e.g., eutrophication) in recent decades as a result of human interventions and climate change (Ayres et al. 1996; Haddeland et al. 2014).

6862856,"Evaluating The Effects Of Human Activity Over The Last Decades On The Soil Organic Carbon Pool Using Satellite Imagery And Gis Techniques In The Nile Delta Area, Egypt","The study aims to clarify the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) and human activity under arid conditions, in the east area of the Nile Delta, Egypt. SOC is one of the critical factors in food production and plays an important role in the climate change because it affects the physio-chemical soil characteristics, plant growth, and contributes to sustainable development on global levels. For the purpose of our investigations, 120 soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected throughout different land uses and soil types of the study area. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship of SOC, soil characteristics, and environmental factors. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat 5 TM in July 1995 and operational land imager (OLI) in July 2018 were used to model SOC pool. The results revealed significant variations of soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) among different soil textures and land-uses. Soil with high clay content revealed an increase in the percentage of soil organic carbon, and had mean SOCP of 6.08 +/- 1.91 Mg C ha(-1), followed by clay loams and loamy soils. The higher values of SOCP were observed in the northern regions of the study area. The phenomenon is associated with the expansion of the human activity of initiating fish ponds that reflected higher values of SOC that were related to the organic additions used as nutrients for fish. Nevertheless, the SOC values decreased in southeast of the study area with the decrease of soil moisture contents and the increase in the heavy texture profiles. As a whole, our findings pointed out that the human factor has had a significant impact on the variation of soil organic carbon values in the Eastern Nile Delta from 1995 to 2018. As land use changes from agricultural activity to fish ponds, the SOCP significantly increased. The agriculture land-use revealed higher SOCP with 60.77 Mg C ha(-1) in clay soils followed by fish ponds with 53.43 Mg C ha(-1). The results also showed a decrease in SOCP values due to an increasing in land surface temperature (LST) thus highlighting that influence of temperature and ambient soil conditions linked to land-use changes have a marked impact on surface SOCP and C sequestration.","{""AbdelRahman, Mohamed A.

6670465,"Wildland Fire Management And Air Quality In The Southern Sierra Nevada: Using The Lion Fire As A Case Study With A Multi-Year Perspective On Pm2.5 Impacts And Fire Policy","Management of fire is an important and controversial policy issue. Active fire suppression has led to a backlog of fuels, limited the ecological benefits of fire, and reduced short-term smoke impacts likely delaying these emissions to future generations over a larger spatial extent. Smoke impacts can be expected to increase as fire size and intensity increase and the fuel backlog is consumed; whether through reintroduction of fire under desirable conditions or through stand replacing fire. Land Management Agencies would like to increase the use of naturally ignited fires to burn during favorable conditions as a way to reduce catastrophic fires. This study provides information about the levels of air quality impacts expected from these types of fires and discusses some of the policy controversies of managed fire that propagate inconsistencies between agencies and enter the public discourse. The Lion Fire, a primarily low intensity 8,370ha fire that was extensively monitored for Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), is used to quantify impacts to air quality. PM2.5 monitoring sites are used to assess exposure, public health impacts, and subsequently quantify annual air quality during a year with a fire that is within the historic normal fire size and intensity for this area. Ground level PM2.5 impacts were found to be localized with 99% of the hourly Air Quality Index readings in the moderate or good category for the sites impacted by the fire. PM2.5 concentrations at sites nearest the fire were below annual federal air quality standards for PM2.5 with annual 98th percentile at the most impacted sites (Johnsondale, Kernville, and Camp Nelson) of 35.0, 34.0, and 28.0μgm-3 respectively. Smoke impacts to PM2.5 concentrations were not found to reach the populated Central Valley. The findings suggest that this type of fire can be implemented with minimal public health impacts thus allowing an opportunity for air and fire managers to alter policy to allow additional burning in an area with severe anthropogenic air pollution and where frequent widespread fire is both beneficial and inevitable. The more extensive air quality impacts documented with large high intensity fire may be averted by embracing the use of fire to prevent unwanted high intensity burns. A widespread increase in the use of fire for ecological benefit may provide the resiliency needed in Sierra Nevada forests as well as be the most beneficial to public health through the reduction of single dose exposure to smoke and limiting impacts spatially. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","{""Cisneros, R."",""Schweizer, D.""}","10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.06.007",2024-04-11 22:19:25,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{cco}","{""Air Pollutants"",""Air quality"",California,""Conservation of Natural Resources"",Fires,Humans,""Particle Size"",""Particulate Matter"",Policy,""Public health"",""Sierra Nevada [California]"",""Smoke impacts"",""United States"",""Wildland fire"",""air monitoring"",""air pollutant"",""air pollution"",""air pollution control"",""air quality standard"",""ambient air"",analysis,article,control,""ecosystem resilience"",""environmental impact"",""environmental impact assessment"",""environmental management"",""environmental planning"",""environmental protection"",fire,""fire management"",fuel,human,""population density"",""prescribed burning"",prevention,procedures,""protocol compliance"",""satellite imagery"",smoke,wildfire,""wildland fire management""}"
6862942,"Characterizing Forest Succession With Lidar Data: An Evaluation For The Inland Northwest, Usa","Quantifying forest structure is important for sustainable forest management, as it relates to a wide variety of ecosystem processes and services. Lidar data have proven particularly useful for measuring or estimating a suite of forest structural attributes such as canopy height, basal area, and LAI. However, the potential of this technology to characterize forest succession remains largely untested. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse, mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random Forests) to classify six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracy > 95%. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others. This study highlights the utility of lidar data for accurately classifying forest succession in complex, mixed coniferous forests; but further research should be conducted to classify forest successional stages across different forests types. The techniques presented herein can be easily applied to other areas.

6863511,"Radiation Use Efficiency Of Forage Resources: A Meta-Analysis","Forage production is increasingly monitored through models based on remote sensing. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) is a key input to these models. However, no study has synthesized the published values of RUE of forage resources. Our objective was to quantitatively synthesize through a meta-analysis the variation of RUE of forage resources and its main controls. We gathered 496 RUE values and assessed their variation according to genotype, resource availability and phenological stage. Mean RUE was 1.93 +/- 1.2 g of dry matter (DM) per megajoule of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) (+/- SD). The RUE was most responsive to genotype and to direct and indirect manipulations of resource availability. Within genotype treatments, mean effect size of C-4 species identity, cultivar identity and C-3 species identity was 61, 58, and 42\%, respectively. Within resource availability treatments, mean effect size was 43\% for N fertilization, 40\% for shading and inter-annual environmental variation and 23\% for irrigation and defoliation frequency. For the phenology treatment, mean effect size of reproductive vs. vegetative stage did not differ from zero. This large variability implies a challenge to select RUE values as input to estimate productivity through plant-growth models, such as those based on remote sensing, but also highlight the margin for increasing RUE through breeding and management practices.","{""Druille, Magdalena"",""Oesterheld, Martin"",""Oyarzabal, Mariano""}","10.2134/agronj2018.10.0645",2024-07-19 20:24:13,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}",NA

However, the dermatologists can diagnose skin lesion diseases by carefully examining the high-quality images at their clinics or from a distance area. Further, the computerized automatic diagnostic system may assist primary health professionals for quick and accurate diagnosis of these skin diseases. Thus, there is a need for medical image processing and analysis of skin lesion images to enhance their visibility properties. An efficient and effective skin lesion detection and identification software tool will provide a better classification system and may enhance the automation of skin lesion diagnosis. In this work, detection of skin lesions from human skin images is conducted by utilizing three image processing segmentation methodologies namely-Edge Detection using Ant Colony Optimization, Color Space-based Thresholding, Genetic Algorithm-based Segmentation and FCM-Based Image Segmentation. In order to quantitatively collate the working of three techniques, the entropy values of skin lesion images are considered.

Due to these data transmissions, the number of connections to the existing computer networks is increased. Being interoperable and interconnected these personalized medical devices provide great benefits like improved sensing capabilities and actuating capabilities. But the problem with high connectivity computer networks is that it exposes medical device to high cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The main targets are the pacemakers and institutions like hospitals and clinics. Hackers can easily hack medical devices and change prescriptions. So a cybersecurity breach can leak a patient's sensitive and confidential data and risk the patient's life.

6863421,"Spatiotemporal Variations In Soil Loss Across The Biodiversity Hotspots Of Western Ghats Region, India","Quantifying the soil loss in the Western Ghats Region (WGR) is challenging due to limited long-term observation data and accessibility issues, as well as the WGR spanning multiple administrative units. This study aimed to estimate long-term spatiotemporal variations in soil loss rates across the WGR. Using remote sensing inputs, such as LANDSAT-8, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and rainfall records to estimate soil loss rates using the USLE method from 1990 to 2020. Results indicated that the average soil loss for the WGR was 32.3, 46.2, 50.2, and 62.7 Tons ha(-1) yr(-1) for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively, showing a concerning 94\% increase, and an consistently increasing trend. The state-wise increase is highest in Tamil Nadu (121\%), followed by Gujarat (119\%), Maharashtra (96\%), Kerala (90\%), Goa (80\%), and Karnataka (56\%). These high rates of increase in soil loss are unsustainable to support the biodiversity of WGR and can lead to permanent destruction. The study highlights the importance of considering the long-term effects of land use change on soil erosion and the need for sustainable land management practices, and benefits of using open source satellite products for monitoring. The results can be used to sensitise government agencies on the need to protect the natural land cover, which will reduce soil erosion. The need for conservation and preservation of the WGR is of paramount importance, and steps must be taken to ensure that the natural land cover is protected and soil erosion is reduced.","{""Chinnasamy, Pennan"",""Honap, Vaishnavi U.""}","10.1007/s12040-023-02098-x",2024-07-17 21:41:47,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Western Ghats; biodiversity conservation; soil erosion; USLE; sustainable land management""}"
6691701,"A political history of U.S. Commercial remote sensing, 1984-2007: conflict, collaboration, and the role of knowledge in the high-tech world of earth observation satellites","The political history of U.S. commercial remote sensing began in 1984 when the U.S. government first attempted to commercialize its civil earth observation satellite system – Landsat. Since then, the high technology of earth imaging satellite systems has generated intense debates and policy conflicts, primarily centered on U.S. government concerns over the national security and foreign policy implications of high-resolution commercial satellite systems. Conversely, proponents of commercial observation satellites have urged U.S. policymakers to recognize the scientific and socio-economic utility of commercial remote sensing and thus craft and implement regulatory regimes that allow for a greater degree of information openness and transparency in using earth observation satellite imagery. This dissertation traces and analyzes that tumultuous political history and examines the policy issues and social construction of commercial remote sensing to determine the role of knowledge in the effective crafting and execution of commercial remote sensing laws and policies.\nAlthough individual and organizational perspectives, interests, missions, and cultures play a significant role in the social construction of commercial observation satellite systems and programs, the problem of insufficient knowledge of the myriad dimensions and complex nature of commercial remote sensing is a little studied but important component of this social construction process. Knowledge gaps concerning commercial remote sensing extend to various dimensions of the subject matter, such as the global, economic, technical, and legal/policy aspects.\nNumerous examples of knowledge voids are examined to suggest a connection between deficient knowledge and divergent policy perceptions as they relate to commercial remote sensing. Relevant knowledge voids are then structurally categorized to demonstrate the vastness and complexity of commercial remote sensing policy issues and to offer recommendations on how to fill such knowledge gaps to effect increased collaboration between the US government and the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry. Finally, the dissertation offers suggestions for future STS studies on policy issues, particularly those that focus on the global dimensions of commercial remote sensing or on applying the knowledge gap concept advanced by this dissertation to other areas of science and technology policymaking.","{""Kenneth, Thompson""}","https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/30235",2024-04-22 02:28:19,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2007,"{}","{""Remote Sensing|Satellite|DigitalGlobe|Orbimage|Space Imaging|GeoEye|NOAA|GSD|Ikonos|QuickBird|Orbvie""}"
6862886,"Winter Wheat Yield Forecasting In Ukraine Based On Earth Observation, Meteorological Data And Biophysical Models","Ukraine is one of the most developed agriculture countries and one of the biggest crop producers in the world. Timely and accurate crop yield forecasts for Ukraine at regional level become a key element in providing support to policy makers in food security. In this paper, feasibility and relative efficiency of using moderate resolution satellite data to winter wheat forecasting in Ukraine at oblast level is assessed. Oblast is a sub-national administrative unit that corresponds to the NUTS2 level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) of the European Union. NDVI values were derived from the MODIS sensor at the 250 m spatial resolution. For each oblast NDVI values were averaged for a cropland map (Rainfed croplands class) derived from the ESA GlobCover map, and were used as predictors in the regression models. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the best time for making reliable yield forecasts in terms of root mean square error was identified. For most oblasts, NDVI values taken in April-May provided the minimum RMSE value when comparing to the official statistics, thus enabling forecasts 2-3 months prior to harvest. The NDVI-based approach was compared to the following approaches: empirical model based on meteorological observations (with forecasts in April-May that provide minimum RMSE value) and WOFOST crop growth simulation model implemented in the CGMS system (with forecasts in June that provide minimum RMSE value). All three approaches were run to produce winter wheat yield forecasts for independent datasets for 2010 and 2011, i.e. on data that were not used within model calibration process. The most accurate predictions for 2010 were achieved using the CGMS system with the RMSE value of 0.3 t ha(-1) in June and 0.4 t ha(-1) in April, while performance of three approaches for 2011 was almost the same (0.5-0.6 t ha(-1) in April). Both NDVI-based approach and CGMS system over-estimated winter wheat yield comparing to official statistics in 2010, and underestimated it in 2011. Therefore, we can conclude that performance of empirical NDVI-based regression model was similar to meteorological and CGMS models when producing winter wheat yield forecasts at oblast level in Ukraine 2-3 months prior to harvest, while providing minimum requirements to input datasets.

6691515,"Landscape Analysis of Cobalt Mining Activities from 2009 to 2021 Using Very High Resolution Satellite Data (Democratic Republic of the Congo)","The cobalt mining sector is well positioned to be a key contributor in determining the success of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite the important contribution to the DRC’s economy, the rapid expansion of mining operations has resulted in major social, health, and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the cumulative impact of mining activities on the landscape of a prominent cobalt mining area in the DRC. To achieve this, an object-based method, employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, was used to map land cover across the city of Kolwezi and the surrounding mining areas, where long-term mining activity has dramatically altered the landscape. The research used very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery (2009, 2014, 2019, 2021) to map the spatial distribution of land cover and land cover change, as well as analyse the spatial relationship between land cover classes and visually identified mine features, from 2009 to 2021. Results from the object-based SVM land cover classification produced an overall accuracy of 85.2–90.4% across the time series. Between 2009 and 2021, land cover change accounted to: rooftops increasing by 147.2% (+7.7 km2); impervious surface increasing by 104.7% (+3.35 km2); bare land increasing by 85.4% (+33.81 km2); exposed rock increasing by 56.2% (+27.46 km2); trees decreasing by 4.5% (−0.34 km2); shrub decreasing by 38.4% (−26.04 km2); grass and cultivated land decreasing by 27.1% (−45.65 km2); and water decreasing by 34.6% (−3.28 km2). The co-location of key land cover classes and visually identified mine features exposed areas of potential environmental pollution, with 91.6% of identified water situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature, and vulnerable populations, with 71.6% of built-up areas (rooftop and impervious surface class combined) situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature. Assessing land cover patterns over time and the interplay between mine features and the landscape structure allowed the study to amplify the findings of localised on-the-ground research, presenting an alternative viewpoint to quantify the true scale and impact of cobalt mining in the DRC. Filling geospatial data gaps and examining the present and past trends in cobalt mining is critical for informing and managing the sustainable growth and development of the DRC’s mining sector.","{""Brown, Chloe""}","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14159545",2024-04-26 18:47:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""cobalt|child labour|Copperbelt|sustainable mining|land cover""}"

First, the region defined by the TRMM measurements is partitioned into approximately 28 000 nonoverlapping clusters using a recursive k-means clustering scheme. Next, a statistical model is used characterize the extreme precipitation events occurring in each cluster. Instead of applying the block maxima approach used in the existing system, in which the generalized extreme value probability distribution is fit to the annual precipitation maxima at each site separately, the present work adopts the peak-over-threshold method of classifying points as extreme if they exceed a prespecified threshold. Theoretical considerations motivate using the point process framework for modeling extremes. The fitted parameters are used to estimate trends and to construct simple and intuitive average recurrence interval (ARI) maps that reveal how rare a particular precipitation event is. This information could be used by policy makers for disaster monitoring and prevention. The new method eliminates much of the noise that was produced by the existing models because of a short data record, producing more reasonable ARI maps when compared with NOAA's long-term Climate Prediction Center ground-based observations. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied to other extreme climate records. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","{""Demirdjian, L."",""Huffman, G.

6863023,"Recent Ogallala Aquifer Region Drought Conditions As Observed By Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies From Grace","Recent severe drought events have occurred over the Ogallala Aquifer region (OAR) during the period 2011–2015, creating significant impacts on water resources and their use in regional environmental and economic systems. The changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS), as indicated by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), reveals a detailed picture of the temporal and spatial evolution of drought events. The observations by GRACE indicate the worst drought conditions occurred in September 2012, with an average TWS deficit of ~8 cm in the northern OAR and ~11 cm in the southern OAR, consistent with precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project. Comparing changes in TWS with precipitation shows the TWS changes can be predominantly attributable to variations in precipitation. Power spectrum and squared wavelet coherence analysis indicate a significant correlation between TWS change and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and the influence of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures on TWS change is much stronger in the southern OAR than the northern OAR. The results of this study illustrate the value of GRACE in not just the diagnosis of significant drought events, but also in possibly improving the predictive power of remote signals that are impacted by nonregional climatic events (El Nino), ultimately leading to improved water resource management applications on a regional scale.

6862815,"A Citsci Approach For Rapid Earthquake Intensity Mapping: A Case Study From Istanbul (Turkey)","Nowadays several scientific disciplines utilize Citizen Science (CitSci) as a research approach. Natural hazard research and disaster management also benefit from CitSci since people can provide geodata and the relevant attributes using their mobile devices easily and rapidly during or after an event. An earthquake, depending on its intensity, is among the highly destructive natural hazards. Coordination efforts after a severe earthquake event are vital to minimize its harmful effects and timely in-situ data are crucial for this purpose. The aim of this study is to perform a CitSci pilot study to demonstrate the usability of data obtained by volunteers (citizens) for creating earthquake iso-intensity maps in a short time. The data were collected after a 5.8 Mw Istanbul earthquake which occurred on 26 September 2019. Through the mobile app ""I felt the quake"", citizen observations regarding the earthquake intensity were collected from various locations. The intensity values in the app represent a revised form of the Mercalli intensity scale. The iso-intensity map was generated using a spatial kriging algorithm and compared with the one produced by The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), Turkey, empirically. The results show that collecting the intensity information via trained users is a plausible method for producing such maps.","{""Gokceoglu, Candan"",""Kocaman, Sultan"",""Yalcin, Ilyas""}","10.3390/ijgi9040266",2024-07-19 20:36:57,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2020,"{}","{""citizen science; CitSci; earthquake; intensity mapping; disaster mitigation; spatial kriging""}"

6691556,"Use of the McHargian LUSA in agricultural research and decisionmaking in the age of non-stationarity and big earth observation data","In the past fifty years, there have been two major changes that are of methodological and consequential importance to the McHargian land-use suitability analysis (LUSA): increasing evidence of nonstationarity of global and regional ecological conditions and increasing availability of high resolution spatial-temporal earth observation data. For fifty years, the McHargian LUSA has been an important analysis tool for designers and planners for both regional conservation planning and development. McHarg's LUSA is a decision support tool that reduces the dimensions of spatial-temporal data. This makes the technique relevant beyond decision support to spatial identification and prediction of areas of socio-ecological opportunity, risk, and priority. In this article, I use a set of recent studies relating to agricultural LUSA to reveal relationships between the traditional McHargian LUSA and related spatialtemporal research methods that are adapting to more data and non-stationary ecological conditions. Using a classification based on descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive research activities, I organize these related methods and illustrate how linkages between research activities can be used to assimilate more kinds of spatial “big data,” address non-stationarity in socio-ecological systems, and suggest ways to enhance decision-making and collaboration between planners and other sciences.","{""Lim, Theodore""}","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42532-019-00022-6",2024-04-23 22:32:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""big earth observation data|agriculture|land use suitability|non-stationarity""}"

Our study investigated changes in ecosystem services in response to land use changes caused mainly by climate change and human activities on the Zoige Plateau, a region in the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau with large areas of grassland and wetland. The aim was to provide guidance for sustainable management of high, cold pasture areas. We used remote sensing to evaluate land use changes, and then applied a fast method for evaluating ecological service values in 1975, 1990, and 2005. The value of ecosystem services dropped from 61.46 x 10(9) yuan in 1975 to 58.61 x 10(9) yuan in 2005, exhibiting an accelerating rate of decrease, mainly due to the degradation of wetlands and, to a lesser extent, high-cover grassland. Waste treatment and water supply were the two largest service functions, contributing about 42\% of the total service value. The results suggest that future land use planning should emphasize the protection of wetlands, high-cover grassland, and woodland, which have the highest ecosystem service values and showed the greatest degradation during the study period.

6863148,"Minimizing Signal Detection Time In Postmarket Sequential Analysis: Balancing Positive Predictive Value And Sensitivity","Purpose: Outcome misclassification in retrospective epidemiologic analyses has been well-studied, but little is known about such misclassification with respect to sequential statistical analysis during surveillance of medical product-associated risks, a planned capability of the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System. Methods: Using a vaccine example, we model and simulate sequential database surveillance in an observational data network using a variety of outcome detection algorithms. We consider how these algorithms, as characterized by sensitivity and positive predictive value, impact the length of surveillance and timeliness of safety signal detection. We show investigators/users of these networks how they can perform preparatory study design calculations that consider outcome misclassification in sequential database surveillance. Results: Non-differential outcome misclassification generates longer surveillance times and less timely safety signal detection as compared with the case of no misclassification. Inclusive algorithms characterized by high sensitivity but low positive predictive value outperform more narrow algorithms when detecting rare outcomes. This decision calculus may change considerably if medical chart validation procedures were required. Conclusions: These findings raise important questions regarding the design of observational data networks used for pharmacovigilance. Specifically, there are tradeoffs involved when choosing to populate such networks with component databases that are large as compared with smaller integrated delivery system databases that can more easily access laboratory or clinical data and perform medical chart validation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","{""Brown, J.

6862961,"Temporal And Phenological Profiles Of Open And Dense Caatinga Using Remote Sensing: Response To Precipitation And Its Irregularities","Caatinga is a typical biome of Brazil's semiarid regions and subject to climate changes. Research is needed on the relation of its features to climate events. This study analyzed the influence of rainfall and its irregularities in open and dense woody Caatinga vegetation. Phenological curves were generated by means of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time profiles in the Grota do Angico Conservation Unit study area in Sergipe State. Rainfall data from 2000 to 2018 were collected and phenological curves generated using various estimate methods that produced the following variables: {[}start of season, end of season, peak of season position, length of season, mean growing season and maximum seasonal]. Rainfall showed a standard intra-annual behavior, with inter-annual variations related to irregularities influencing Caatinga response. Dense Caatinga vegetation had higher values of NDVI in all periods, even in anomalous years compared to open Caatinga, in addition to having longer leaf coverage over the year, with an anticipated start and a more extended seasonal end. The analysis of the rainfall regime made it possible to assess its influence on the Caatinga and phenological profiles proved to be fundamental to understand periods of physiological change of open and dense Caatinga. These results indicate that dense Caatinga maintains physiological activity longer, which may be associated with greater moisture maintenance in a semiarid region. In addition, because it has a greater leaf cover for longer periods, the soil may be preserved and maintain its characteristics longer, reducing the effects of desertification. The results may be associated with the type of forest management and conservation in this region. The total or partial suppression of individual remnants of Caatinga should be avoided, since the most open areas have lower photosynthetic capacity, affected to a considerable extent from the effects of adverse climatic conditions. Additionally, open Caatinga has a reduced capacity for regenerating naturally and its use by communities in this semiarid region should be limited.","{""Barreto, Ikaro Daniel de Carvalho"",""Hillebrand, Fernando Luis"",""Kuplich, Tatiana Mora"",""da Rosa, Cristiano Niederauer"",""de Jesus, Janisson Batista""}","10.1007/s11676-020-01145-3",2024-09-27 23:49:32,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""Semiarid; Tropical dry forest; NDVI; MODIS; Phenopix""}"

Previous studies have evaluated the layout and quality of public space in residential areas based on residents' subjective satisfaction, however, there still lack studies exploring residents' behavior patterns and the use of public spaces based on objective measurement standards. Therefore, this paper selected the public space in the large affordable housing areas in the suburbs as the research object and used social network analysis (SNA) to objectively evaluate the network density, clustering coefficient and small-world value of the public space in affordable housing from the perspective of the physical spatial network of the built public space. Based on the network structure characteristics of existing public spaces, this paper further explores the relationship between the frequency of public space use in and the characteristics of nodes' social networks and their own attributes, and the influence of public space layout structure on the behavioral patterns of affordable housing residents. This paper puts forward proposals for the renovation and optimization of public space according to the behavioral preferences of affordable housing residents, so as to complete the network of public space, promote the interaction and communication of residents in the residential area, enhance the residents' experience of using public space and improve the living standard of residents in the residential area.","{""Liu, Lingbo"",""Peng, Zhenghong"",""Shang, Zhourui"",""Yu, Yang"",""Zhao, Jie""}","10.3390/land10090955",2024-07-18 21:06:31,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2021,"{}","{""affordable housing; public space; social network analysis; space layout optimization""}"
6691743,"Potential benefits of climate forecasting to agriculture","Climate variability leads to economic and food security risks throughout the world because of its major influences on agriculture. Accurate forecasts of climate 3–6 months ahead of time can potentially allow farmers and others in agriculture to make decisions to reduce unwanted impacts or take advantage of expected favorable climate. However, potential benefits of climate forecasts vary considerably because of many physical, biological, economic, social, and political factors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential economic value of climate forecasts for farm scale management decisions in one location in the Southeast USA (Tifton, GA; 31°23′N; 83°31′W) for comparison with previously-derived results for the Pampas region of Argentina. The same crops are grown in both regions but at different times of the year. First, the expected value of tailoring crop mix to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases for a typical farm in Tifton was estimated using crop models and historical daily weather data. Secondly, the potential values for adjusting management of maize (Zea maize L.) to different types of climate forecasts (perfect knowledge of (a) ENSO phase, (b) growing season rainfall categories, and (c) daily weather) were estimated for Tifton and Pergamino, Argentina (33°55′S; 60°33′W). Predicted benefits to the farm of adjusting crop mix to ENSO phase averaged from US$ 3 to 6 ha−1 over all years, depending on the farmer’s initial wealth and aversion to risk. Values calculated for Argentina were US$ 9–15 for Pergamino and up to US$ 35 for other locations in the Pampas. Varying maize management by ENSO phase resulted in predicted forecast values of US$ 13 and 15 for Tifton and Pergamino, respectively. The potential value of perfect seasonal forecasts of rainfall tercile on maize profit was higher than for ENSO-based forecasts in both regions (by 28% in Tifton and 70% in Pergamino). Perfect knowledge of daily weather over the next season provided an upper limit on expected value of about US$ 190 ha−1 for both regions. Considering the large areas of field crop production in these regions, the estimated economic potential is very high. However, there are a number of challenges to realize these benefits. These challenges are generally related to the uncertainty of climate forecasts and to the complexities of agricultural systems.","{""Jones, J.W.""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00225-5",2024-04-26 18:51:52,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2000,"{}","{""Climate prediction|Crop models|Forecast value|Optimal management|El Niño|La Niña""}"
6691629,"Quantifying the Cost Reduction Potential for Earth Observation Satellites","In the present budget environment, there is a strong need to dramatically drive down the cost of space missions. There is the perception that SmallSats are inherently much lower cost than more traditional larger satellites and can play a central role in reducing overall space mission cost, but this effect has been difficult to quantify. Without quantifiable evidence of their value, SmallSats are under-utilized as a method for reducing space mission cost. The purpose of this study is to quantify the relationship between cost and performance for space systems, by creating a Performance-Based Cost Model (PBCM). Today, most acquisition performance analyses focus on cost overruns, or how much the system costs relative to what it is expected to cost. Instead, PBCM allows us to focus on more important questions, such as, how much performance we can achieve for a given cost, or what the cost is for a given level of performance. In this paper, we present the relationship between cost vs. orbit altitude for a fixed resolution and coverage requirement, cost vs. resolution, and cost vs. coverage. Traditional cost models for space systems are typically weight-based, primarily because mass allocation is determined early in mission design and has historically correlated well with actual hardware cost. To provide the underlying cost data for this study, we apply 3 cost models widely used throughout the aerospace cost modeling community: the Unmanned Space Vehicle Cost Model (USCM), the Aerospace Corp. Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM), and the NASA Instrument Cost Model (NICM). Our first application of the PBCM is for Earth observation systems. Past Earth observation systems have used traditional space technology to achieve the best possible performance, but have been very expensive. In addition, low-cost, responsive dedicated launch has not been available for SmallSats. Space system mass is proportional to the cube of the linear dimensions—equivalent to saying that most spacecraft have about the same density. This means that by flying at lower altitudes, satellites can reduce their payload size and therefore the entire mass of the satellite, thus reducing the cost of the system dramatically. We conclude that for an Earth observation system, an increase in performance, reduction in cost, or both, is possible by using multiple SmallSats at lower altitudes when compared to traditional systems. Specifically,\nBy using modern microelectronics and light-weight materials such as composite structures, future SmallSats\nobservation systems, operating at a lower altitude than traditional systems, have the potential for:\n– Comparable or better performance (resolution and coverage)\n– Much lower overall mission cost (by a factor of 2 to 10)\n– Lower risk (both implementation and operations)\n– Shorter schedules\nRelevant secondary advantages for the low-altitude SmallSats include:\n– Lower up-front development cost\n– More sustainable business model\n– More flexible and resilient\n– More responsive to both new technologies and changing needs\n– Mitigates the problem of orbital debris\nThe principal demerits of the approach are the lack of low-cost launch vehicles, the need for a new way of doing business, and changing the way we think about the use of space assets. This paper provides the basis for this assessment, estimates for the level of cost reduction, and reports on additional results since the 2013 Reinventing Space Conference and AIAA Space 2014 Conference.","{""Shao, Anthony""}","https://smad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RS-Paper_Final.pdf",2024-04-25 02:44:29,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2014,"{}","{""Reinventing Space| Cost Reduction| Observation Satellites|Low-altitude| SmallSats|Cost Estimation|Co""}"
6863476,"Estimation Of Degraded Grassland Aboveground Biomass Using Machine Learning Methods From Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data","Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important indicator for grassland ecosystem assessment, management and utilization. Remote sensing technologies have driven the development of grassland AGB estimation from labor-intensive to highly-efficient. However, optical image-based remote sensing methods are fraught with uncertainty issues due to the saturation effects. In this study, we evaluated the capability of the emerging terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technique in estimating grassland AGB in the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China. Seven variables (i.e., canopy cover, canopy volume, mean height, maximum height, minimum height, range of height, and standard deviation of height) were extracted from the TLS data of 30 plots across the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China, and were used to build regression models with field measured AGB using four regression methods, which are simple regression (SR) model, stepwise multiple regression (SMR) model, random forest (RF) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results demonstrate that TLS is a feasible technique for extracting grassland structural parameters. Mean grass height and canopy cover obtained from TLS data have good correspondence with field measurements (R2 > 0.7, p-values < 0.001). Among the four regression models, the SMR model yields the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 48.89 g/m2), followed by the RF model (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 68.72 g/m2), the SR model (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 86.4 g/m2), and the ANN model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 101.40 g/m2). Minimum grass height and canopy coverage are the two most important variables influencing the prediction accuracy of the SMR model, and the prediction accuracy of the SMR model increases with the increase of point density. The results of this study can provide guidance for choosing the optimal model and data collection method for estimating degraded grassland AGB using TLS in agro-pastoral ecotone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","{""Guo, Q."",""Hu, T."",""Jin, S."",""Li, Y."",""Liu, H."",""Liu, J."",""Ma, Q."",""Su, Y."",""Wang, R."",""Xu, K."",""Zhai, Q."",""Zhang, J.""}","10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105747",2024-07-17 21:27:43,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{calibration}","{""Aboveground biomass"",""Aboveground biomass (AGB)"",""Agro-pastoral ecotones"",""Artificial neural network models"",Biomass,China,""Decision trees"",""Degraded grassland"",Ecosystems,Forecasting,""Geometrical optics"",""Laser applications"",""Learning systems"",""Machine learning"",Management,""Neural networks"",""Northern agro-pastoral ecotone"",""Regression analysis"",""Remote sensing"",""Remote sensing technology"",Scanning,""Seebeck effect"",""Steel beams"",""Stepwise multiple regression"",""Surveying instruments"",""Terrestrial laser scanning"",""Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)"",""accuracy assessment"",degradation,ecotone,""environmental assessment"",""estimation method"",girders,grass,grassland,""laser method"",methodology,""numerical model"",""uncertainty analysis"",utilization}"
6863548,"Sentinel-1 Polarimetry To Map Apple Orchard Damage After A Storm","Climate change increases extreme whether events such as floods, hailstorms, or storms, which can affect agriculture, causing damages and economic loss within the agro-food sector. Optical remote sensing data have been successfully used in damage detections. Cloud conditions limit their potential, especially while monitoring floods or storms that are usually related to cloudy situ-ations. Conversely, data from the Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) are operational in all-weather conditions and are sensitive to the geometrical properties of crops. Apple orchards play a key role in the Italian agriculture sector, presenting a cultivation system that is very sensitive to high-wind events. In this work, the H-α-A polarimetric decomposition technique was adopted to map damaged apple orchards with reference to a stormy event that had occurred in the study area (NW Italy) on 12 August 2020. The results showed that damaged orchards have higher H (entropy) and α (alpha angle) values compared with undamaged ones taken as reference (Mann–Whitney one-tailed test U = 14,514, p < 0.001; U = 16604, p < 0.001 for H and α, respectively). By contrast, A (anisotropy) values were significantly lower for damaged orchards (Mann–Whitney one-tailed test U = 8616, p < 0.001). Based on this evidence, the authors generated a map of potentially storm-dam-aged orchards, assigning a probability value to each of them.

6691532,"Decision Support Model and Visualization for Assessing Environmental Phenomena, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, and Satellite Design Using Earth Observation Data","With the increasing availability of Earth Observation (EO) data has come a commensurate rise in EO applications. To address the dual needs of processing data for applications and designing missions with applications in mind, we present a multi-disciplinary, integrated modeling framework to advance environmental management, policymaking, and observation platform design. This core modeling framework is called Environment-Vulnerability-DecisionTechnology (EVDT). EVDT is not the model itself, it is the framework that guides the creation of an integrated model customized to each application with a specific set of stakeholders in mind and designed using Systems Architecture. The EVDT framework can be customized to build integrated models specific to a certain application. Individual models in the framework include certain core models (Environment, Vulnerability, Decision, Technology) and optional models such as Public Health which are added when needed for a specific application. The Environment Model uses earth science methods to estimate the state of environmental phenomena; The Vulnerability Model captures societal impact of environmental changes including ecosystem services; the Decision Model captures human behavior and policy consequences; and the Technology Model provides tools to design earth observation systems or select among earth observation technologies such as satellites, airborne sensors, and in-situ sensors. The intent in developing this framework and its applications is to lead to the development of a standard to facilitate the re-use of models and the design of future remote observation systems.

6691664,"Economic and social benefits of meteorology and climatology in Switzerland","National Meteorological Services provide meteorological data, information, forecasts and various related products, which are important for the smooth functioning of many aspects in economy, administration and society. The merit of meteorological services cannot be deduced directly from the consumption of services. Rather, it emerges from the improvement of decisions by economic stakeholders thanks to weather and climate information. These services are purchased by users in order to be able to offer optimally or demand a certain service or, with respect to security, these services aim at helping to prevent damage from extreme events.\n\nA rough estimate for a number of selected sectors shows that benefits from weather services in Switzerland are in the region of hundreds of millions Swiss Francs (1 Swiss Franc ∼ €0.66, US$0.83 as at 2008).\n\nThis pilot study shows that it is not possible to estimate one single figure representing the overall benefit from weather services in a country. Concerning the economic sector, a benefit analysis should therefore concentrate on those sub-sectors where weather services are particularly relevant, i.e. agriculture, construction, energy, insurance, telecommunication, tourism, transport, logistics and water availability. Analysis of benefits from climate data is of particular interest to MeteoSwiss since the Federal Office is the main source for climate data in Switzerland. Climate data form the basis on which climate change and possible climate threats can be detected.\n\nThis study estimates for the first time the socio-economic benefits of meteorological and climatic information in Switzerland as a small developed European country and gives an outlook of how a further study might be designed.","{""Frei, Thomas""}","https://doi.org/10.1002/met.156",2024-04-26 23:09:37,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2010,"{}","{""meteorological information|weather service|public goods|economic stakeholders|climate change""}"

6862769,"Direct Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals Using Modis Reflectance Data And Machine Learning Over East Asia","Anthropogenic aerosols have rapidly increased since the industrial revolution and are harmful to human health. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are critical for retrieving aerosol properties worldwide. However, current MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products require extensive computations and a precalculated lookup table. This study proposes assumption-free high-resolution AOD retrieval models based on the light gradient boosting machine method using MODIS data and ground-based observations over East Asia. The models were developed with three spatial resolutions: 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km. The results showed that 77.8% of the 250 m AOD values were within the MODIS expected error (EE) range, while 76.5%, 76.3%, and 70.08% of the 500 m, 1 km, and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD values were within the EE range, respectively. Furthermore, an analysis of the time series and detailed spatial distribution of the proposed model-derived AOD based on data from the Korea–United States Air Quality campaign demonstrated the excellent quality of the 250 m AOD via further validation using a spatially independent dataset. The Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis identified the sensor zenith angle and top-of-atmosphere reflectance of the blue band as the key contributors to the models. In addition, while MAIAC has limited spatial coverage, the spatial frequency of the proposed direct AOD retrieval was nearly 1.5-times higher than that of the MAIAC AOD. Our findings confirmed that machine learning-based high-resolution AOD estimates can be obtained using only satellite data. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","{""Im, J."",""Kang, E."",""Kim, M."",""Park, S."",""Song, C.

6862925,"Ecological Risk Pattern Based On Land Use Changes In Jiangsu Coastal Areas","In order to assess ecological risk caused by land use changes in a region with a rapidly developing economy, based on remote sensing data of land use in Jiangsu coastal areas in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015, this study analyzed the land use changes and its transformation, quantitatively supported by Geographic Information System(GIS). The present study built an ecological risk index based on the landscape disturbance index and vulnerability index, and then the spatial and temporal dynamic changes of landscape ecological risk were quantitatively evaluated using geostatistical analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results showed that the ecological security of Jiangsu coastal areas had improved, and the average ecological risk value of the entire region decreased from 0.1563 in 1990 to 0.1529 in 2015. In the last 25 years, the moderate ecological risk level covered the largest area of the study region; the higher ecological risk level was mainly distributed in the cultivated land of the southwestern region and the waters of the western region of the study area, and its area decreased. Grade reduction zones of ecological risk were mainly concentrated in the higher ecological risk area, moderate ecological risk area, and lower ecological risk area. Meanwhile, grade increase zones of ecological risk were mainly concentrated in the lower ecological risk area and moderate ecological risk area, that is, the grassland and waters of the eastern region of the study area and the cultivated land of the southwestern region. The rapid development of the port industry and new coastal town resulted in the intensification of land use change, which damaged the balance of the ecosystems. The overall spatial difference of ecological risk in the study area had increased, showing the high-high aggregation and low-low aggregation in the local area. The area of high value primarily aggregated gathered south along the western boundary of the study area, and the low value aggregation region was largely distributed in the northeast of the study area and the eastern coastal areas. In addition, arable land, waterbodies, and construction land were the main sources of ecological risk in the study area. The results of the present study could provide a scientific theoretical basis and reliable technical support for the realization of land sustainable utilization, promoting the coordinated development of land use and environment protection, and the policy making of ecological risk management. © 2018 Science Press.

6863231,"Evaluate The Effect Of Topographic Factors And Lithology On Forest Cover Distribution: A Case Study Of The Moroccan High Atlas","Understanding the relationship between the spatial distribution of forest vegetation and influencing factors provides valuable information to decision-makers in land planning, for the sustainable development of forests and efficient monitoring of environmental and ecological issues. This paper aims to understand the effect of topographic factors and lithology on forest cover distribution around Bin El Ouidane dam in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, using remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), field observation, and statistical analysis. The forest vegetation was quantified by calculating the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) from Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDVI was classified according to the density of forest vegetation into four levels: bare soil, low density of forest cover, moderate density of forest cover, and high density of forest cover. The correlation analysis between NDVI, interpreted as forest densities and topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect), derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), showed that elevation has the most significant positive correlation with forest density, with r = 0.563 and a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, moderate and high densities of forest vegetation are optimal in the terrain aspect of the South-East and North-West, respectively. However, the NDVI variation cannot be interpreted only by altitude and terrain aspect. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification has been used to map and to separate the forest vegetation types. The statistical results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the altitude is the most important topographic factor affecting the distribution of forest species. The analysis of frequency histograms revealed that Holm oaks are increasing at high altitudes, and are more abundant in the North-West, while the Thuya species prefer moderate altitudes and are more abundant in the South-East-facing aspects. In our study area, the Holm oak develops on limestone formations. On the contrary, Thuya does not thrive in lithological conditions, and is found with a decreasing level of predominance on limestones, marls-limestones, and sandstones, respectively. The conclusion of the study shows that a combination of topographic factors and lithological conditions affects the spatial distribution of forest vegetation. The adaptation of the forest species to specific topography and lithological conditions should be considered for forest management. It can be helpful in selecting potential sites for reforestation of these species, for conservation of the natural resources, including water and soil.","{""Daghor, Lamia"",""El Moutaki, Saida"",""Lhissou, Rachid"",""Maimouni, Soufiane"",""Oukassou, Mostafa""}","10.1007/s10666-021-09785-3",2024-07-17 19:10:51,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""NDVI; Spectral Angle Mapper; Remote sensing; DEM; GIS; Forest species; Moroccan High Atlas""}"

Both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budgets are examined. Four reasons for recent NOAA satellite funding increases are discussed: (1) responsibilities shifted from NASA to NOAA; (2) NASA decisions that required NOAA system changes; (3) an expanded NOAA satellite mission; and (4) exceptional inflation in the aerospace industry. The analysis reveals a decrease in the real cost of the service component of the satellite program over the years. It also concludes that there has been no growth in the cost of those program components traditionally funded by NOAA, and that only a few percent increase in cost has been experienced in the sum of program funding provided by both NOAA and NASA over the 15-year period.

6863517,"Grazing Influences Biomass Production And Protein Content Of Alpine Meadows","Alpine grasslands are essential for carbon sequestration and food supply for domestic and wild herbivores inhabiting mountainous areas worldwide. These biomes, however, are alternatively threatened by the abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices leading to a fast-growing shrubification process while other mountain grasslands are suffering from the impacts of overgrazing. The functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems is primarily driven by climatic conditions, land-use legacies and grazing. However, although it is critically important, the role of large herbivores on the aboveground biomass and protein content of palatable plants is poorly understood for most alpine meadows. In this work, we explore the effects of grazing on grassland vegetation at two different spatial and temporal scales in the Eastern Pyrenees, Spain. Remote sensing was used to assess the effect of high and moderate grazing (HG and MG respectively) on grass biomass using the leaf area index (LAI) at the meso-scale (patches between 2.3 and 38.7 ha). We also explored the impact of null (NG), overgrazing (MO, mimicked overgrazing) and high (HG) grazing intensities at local scale setting eighteen 1 m2 exclusion boxes in six meadows (three boxes each) commonly used by domestic and wild ungulates. Historical satellite data showed that LAI values are greater in high than in low grazed areas (HG, mean = 0.66, LG, mean = 0.55). Along the same lines, high and moderate grazing pressures improved biomass production at the local-scale (HG, mean = 590.3 g/m(2), MO, mean = 389.3 g/m(2) and NG, mean = 110.8 g/m(2)). Crude protein content reached higher values under MO pressure than under HG pressure. Our results confirm that grazing intensity exerts significant changes on the above-ground biomass production and the protein content of plants consumed by domestic (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (Southern Chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica). We can conclude that ungulates sustain biomass and nutritive values of grass exerting a negligible effect on biomass and protein content of woody vegetation. Our results will inform management guidelines to support profitable grazing activities and promote conservation of the open landscapes in the alpine ecosystems under the current global change scenario.","{""Albanell, Elena"",""Bartolome, Jordi"",""Calleja, Juan Antonio"",""Colom-Cadena, Andreu"",""Espunyes, Johan"",""Fernandez-Aguilar, Xavier"",""Galvez-Ceron, Arturo"",""Gasso, Diana"",""Ibanez, Miguel"",""Jarque-Bascunana, Laia"",""Krumins, Jennifer Adams"",""Lopez-Martin, Josep Maria"",""Serrano, Emmanuel"",""Villamuelas, Miriam""}","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151771",2024-09-27 23:43:24,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Grassland management; Mountain stock farming; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Rupicapra pyrenaica; Bioma""}"

We consider a scenario, where Internet-of-Things devices on the ground operate with sensing and communication in a time-division manner, and can process the sensing results locally, at the edge, or in the cloud via the satellite communication link. Based on the proposed framework, we formulate a multi-dimensional optimization problem to maximize the utility performance of sensing, communication, and computing abilities. After decomposing the original optimization problem into two subproblems, we first derive the closed-form solution of the optimal task partitioning strategy for terrestrial users and satellite users. Then, we develop the joint subframe allocation and task partitioning strategy to optimize the overall performance, by means of which the Pareto optimal solutions can be obtained along the Pareto frontier. Extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which is 10% to 60% superior compared with the benchmarks.

6863478,"Site-Specific Seeding For Maize Production Using Management Zone Maps Delineated With Multi-Sensors Data Fusion Scheme","Uniform rate seeding (URS) density may result in under- or over-optimal plant population that negatively affects crop growth and yield. Site-specific seeding (SSS) is one of the solutions to manage in-field soil variation by optimizing the input seed rate to match soil fertility. This study has evaluated the agronomic and economic response of maize to SSS compared to the URS using a data fusion scheme. Two fields of 5.5 ha and 10 ha in Belgium and France, respectively, were scanned using an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy sensor to measure soil pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), moisture content (MC), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Crop normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were retrieved from several Sentinel-2 images. Measured crop yield, retrieved NDVI and on-line measured soil attributes were then fussed using k-means clustering algorithm to delineate management zone (MZ) maps, whose classes were ranked based on their fertility level and crop yield. A parallel strips experiment was overlaid upon the MZ map, to allow comparing the performance of SSS against URS. Two SSS treatments were implemented in the strip experiment, e.g., the “Kings” approach that recommended the highest seeding density for the highest fertile MZ class and vice versa, and the “Robin Hood” approach followed the opposite principle. Results revealed that SSS treatments increased maize grain yield by 0.25–0.70 Mg ha−1 and thus improved gross margin by 26.7–92.67 € ha−1, compared to the URS. Besides, the SSS-Kings treatment outperformed the URS and SSS-Robin Hood in both fields, whereas the SSS-Robin Hood outperformed the URS treatment only in one field. Soil OC, MC, Mg, and pH revealed a positive correlation each with grain yield in the SSS-Kings treatment. The SSS-Kings treatment is therefore recommended to manage in-field soil variation, which can result in optimizing input seed rates for increasing maize productivity and profitability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","{""Haesaert, G."",""Mouazen, A.

6863425,"A Combined Optimization-Assimilation Framework To Enhance The Predictive Skill Of Community Land Model","Land Surface Model (LSM) predictions are affected by unknown parameters, uncertain meteorological forcings, inaccurate initial conditions, and incomplete process representation. While parameter optimization (PO) algorithms have been used to estimate the model parameter for best model performance, the use of data assimilation (DA) has been receiving increased prominence to characterize the uncertainties in such models. However, it is still an open question that how DA techniques can be used together with PO algorithms to enhance the performance of LSMs for different applications. In this study, a combined framework composed of the PO algorithm-Adaptive Surrogate Modeling Based Optimization (ASMO) and the DA algorithm-Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM), is used to improve the soil moisture (SM) estimates of Community Land Model (CLM) across the Tibetan Plateau in China. The SM data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite are used as the benchmark data for model improvement. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, the simulated SM values are validated against the SM observations collected from the in situ networks in the Tibetan Plateau, China. The findings revealed that the joint application of ASMO and EPFM algorithms results in more accurate and reliable SM estimates of CLM compared to when they are solely employed. This study suggests that the combined optimization-assimilation framework can be utilized for improving the predictive skill of the other large-scale complex LSMs while accounting for the uncertainties associated with both model parameters and state variables.","{""Abbaszadeh, Peyman"",""Duan, Qingyun"",""Gong, Wei"",""Moradkhani, Hamid"",""Xu, Lei"",""Zhang, Chong""}","10.1029/2021wr029879",2024-07-18 22:40:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{algorithm}","{""parameter optimization; data assimilation; Community Land Model; uncertainty quantification""}"

6862853,"Using Morphometric Analysis For Assessment Of Flash Flood Susceptibility In The Mediterranean Region Of Turkey","Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters around the world because of their rapid and unpredictable nature. It is expected that the frequency and intensity of flood events will increase because of extreme rainfall events induced by climate change. In this context, the generation of a flood susceptibility map contributes to effective flood management in a basin. The present study aims to generate a flash flood susceptibility map for the Imali Stream Basin (ISB) situated within the Mediterranean region of Turkey. For this purpose, morphometric analysis, geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used in this study. ASTER GDEM (v.3) was used to delineate 9 sub-watersheds and to obtain the required morphometric parameters. To generate a flash flood susceptibility map, the original compound values ​​calculated for each sub-watershed were transformed into values ​​between 0 and 1 by using the min–max normalization method. Then, these values were divided into 3 classes called low, moderate, and high by using the equal interval classification method in ArcGIS. According to both flash flood susceptibility maps produced by using morphometric analysis and PCA, sub-watershed 5 has the highest flash flood susceptibility in the basin. The flash flood that occurred in sub-watershed 5 in 2016 contributes to these results. Therefore, flood management based on morphometric analysis can be a highly effective method for decision-makers and planners in the Mediterranean region, one of the hotspots to be affected by climate change. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","{""Dutal, H.""}","10.1007/s10661-023-11201-0",2024-07-15 16:16:06,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Climate change"",""Decision making"",Disasters,""Environmental Monitoring"",""Flash flood susceptibility"",Flash-floods,""Flood control"",""Flood event"",""Flood management"",Floods,""Geographic information systems"",""Mediterranean region"",""Morphometric analysis"",""Natural disasters"",""Principal component analysis"",""Principal-component analysis"",""Remote sensing"",""Soil conservation"",""Susceptibility maps"",Turkey,""Water conservation"",""Water management"",""Watershed management"",Watersheds,""Watersheds management"",""flash flood"",""flood frequency""}"

However, rapid urbanization in China has led to a tremendous farmland loss and to the degradation of farmland quality. Based on remote sensing and geographic information system technology, this study developed a semiautomatic procedure for designating PFPAs using high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI), which involved object-based image analysis, farmland composite evaluation, and spatial analysis. It was found that the HRSIs can provide elaborate land-use information, and the PFPA demarcation showed strong correlation with the farmland area and patch distance. For the benefit of spatial planning and management, different demarcation rules should be applied for suburban and exurban areas around a metropolis. Finally, the overall accuracy of HRSI classification was about 80\% for the study area, and high-quality farmlands from evaluation results were selected as PFs. About 95\% of the PFs were demarcated within the PFPAs.

6862745,"High-Resolution Riparian Vegetation Mapping To Prioritize Conservation And Restoration In An Impaired Desert River","In highly impaired watersheds, it is critical to identify both areas with desirable habitat as conservation zones and impaired areas with the highest likelihood of improvement as restoration zones. We present how detailed riparian vegetation mapping can be used to prioritize conservation and restoration sites within a riparian and instream habitat restoration program targeting 3 native fish species on the San Rafael River, a desert river in southeastern Utah, United States. We classified vegetation using a combination of object-based image analysis (OBIA) on high-resolution (0.5m), multispectral, satellite imagery with oblique aerial photography and field-based data collection. The OBIA approach is objective, repeatable, and applicable to large areas. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80\% (Cohen's =0.77). We used this high-resolution vegetation classification alongside existing data on habitat condition and aquatic species' distributions to identify reaches' conservation value and restoration potential to guide management actions. Specifically, cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima) density layers helped to establish broad restoration and conservation reach classes. The high-resolution vegetation mapping precisely identified individual cottonwood trees and tamarisk thickets, which were used to determine specific locations for restoration activities such as beaver dam analogue structures in cottonwood restoration areas, or strategic tamarisk removal in high-density tamarisk sites. The site prioritization method presented here is effective for planning large-scale river restoration and is transferable to other desert river systems elsewhere in the world.","{""Gifford, Suzanne J."",""Laub, Brian G."",""Macfarlane, William W."",""McGinty, Christopher M.""}","10.1111/rec.12425",2024-07-16 23:45:30,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""GIS; habitat assessment; native fish; object-based image analysis; San Rafael River; vegetation clas""}"
6863508,"Development Of A Low Cost, Gps-Based Upgrade To A Standard Handheld Gamma Detector For Mapping Environmental Radioactive Contamination","A low cost extension to a standard handheld radiation monitor was developed, allowing one to perform outdoor georeferenced gamma measurements. It consists of a commercial wireless Bluetooth® GPS receiver, a commercial RS-232 to Bluetooth® converter combined with a standard Bluetooth® enabled pocket personal computer (PPC). The system is intended for use in difficult to access areas, typically for foot campaigns. As the operator walks, a straightforward homemade visual basic program alternately reads GPS position and gamma dose rate into the PPC, creating a data log. This allows a single operator on foot to map between 50 and 200 ha of environmental radiation per day in very rugged areas, depending on the accessiblity of the terrain and the detail required. On a test field with known contamination, a spatial precision of about 5-10 m was obtainable.

6691671,"The ECORS system: A mobility decision-making tool based on earth observation data","This study describes the decision-making system ECORS, dedicated to soils and roads characterization for mobility purposes in operational contexts. This project was initiated by the DGA (Délégation Générale à l’Armement, France) and left to a consortium’s care for the technical realization. This consortium integrates different laboratories, research centers and private companies, specialized in such problematic. The objectives of such study are first to analyze and evaluate current operational technologies able to characterize roads, tracks, and cross-country for mobility either in France or in international contexts. The main data sources authorized are those coming from remote sensors, including remote-sensing data, existing databases, i.e., Topobase Defense, Corinne Landcover, NOAA, etc or opensource data. These data are stored into a GIS oriented tool used for calculating the capacities for vehicles to run on a specific operational theatre. This last operation involves different techniques of data fusion or transformation for estimating the vehicles speed. For this purpose, vehicles performances tables, depending on the theatre features, are established for several climatic scenarios. We describe here the ECORS system, including the selected data sources used in the different processing steps, the technical specifications related to the system architecture and the validation protocols where different decision-making maps are compared to validation data observed on the field.","{""Grandjean, Gilles""}","https://10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417657",2024-04-26 18:45:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2009,"{}","{""Decision making|Earth|Remote sensing|Databases|Military computing|Prototypes|Soil moisture|Roads|Dis""}"
6691639,"Earth observation from space – The issue of environmental sustainability","Remote sensing scientists work under assumptions that should not be taken for granted and should, therefore, be challenged. These assumptions include the following:\n 1. Space, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO), will always be available to governmental and commercial space entities that launch Earth remote sensing missions. \n 2. Space launches are benign with respect to environmental impacts. \n 3. Minimization of Type 1 error, which provides increased confidence in the experimental outcome, is the best way to assess the significance of environmental change. \n 4. Large-area remote sensing investigations, i.e. national, continental, global studies, are best done from space. \n 5. National space missions should trump international, cooperative space missions to ensure national control and distribution of the data products. \nAt best, all of these points are arguable, and in some cases, they’re wrong. Development of observational space systems that are compatible with sustainability principles should be a primary concern when Earth remote sensing space systems are envisioned, designed, and launched. The discussion is based on the hypothesis that reducing the environmental impacts of the data acquisition step, which is at the very beginning of the information stream leading to decision and action, will enhance coherence in the information stream and strengthen the capacity of measurement processes to meet their stated functional goal, i.e. sustainable management of Earth resources. We suggest that unconventional points of view should be adopted and when appropriate, remedial measures considered that could help to reduce the environmental footprint of space remote sensing and of Earth observation and monitoring systems in general. This article discusses these five assumptions in the context of sustainable management of Earth’s resources. Taking each assumption in turn, we find the following: \n(1) Space debris may limit access to Low Earth Orbit over the next decades. \n(2) Relatively speaking, given that they’re rare event, space launches may be benign, but study is\nmerited on upper stratospheric and exospheric layers given the chemical activity associated with rocket combustion by-products. \n(3) Minimization of Type II error should be considered in situations where minimization of Type I error\ngreatly hampers or precludes our ability to correct the environmental condition being studied. \n(4) In certain situations, airborne collects may be less expensive and more environmentally benign,\nand comparative studies should be done to determine which path is wisest. \n(5) International cooperation and data sharing will reduce instrument and launch costs and mission redundancy. Given fiscal concerns of most of the major space agencies e e.g. NASA, ESA, CNES e it seems prudent to combine resources.","{""Durrieu, Sylvie""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003",2024-04-22 02:43:34,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{}","{""Space remote sensing|Earth observation systems|Space junk|Sustainability|Sustainable management|Lida""}"
6903494,"Using Gis To Develop A Model For Forest Fire Risk Mapping","Forests are the most beautiful natural resources around the world and play a pivotal role in preserving environmental balance. An important measure taken for managing and protecting forest areas as well as for decreasing the potential damages caused by the fire is the detection of regions susceptible to forest fire through forest fire risk mapping with different models and methods. In recent years, a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) have been successfully applied in the production of forest fire risk maps. In this study, GIS-based analytical network process as MCDA method was employed in order to provide the fire risk map of Noshahr Forests (North Iran) using slope, slope aspect, altitude, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index, annual rainfall, annual temperature, distance to settlements, and distance to road as input data. Furthermore, to prepare the map of the distribution of occurred fires, MODIS fire product and wide-field observations were used. Thereafter, each of these subcriteria of the utilized factors was standardized according to their significance in a forest fire and then with the extracted coefficients in the analytical network process model merged in ArcGIS software. Finally, the fire risk map was generated. Evaluation of the results obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the designed model has good accuracy with a value of under curve area of 0.783. According to the map prepared, 57.45% of the study area (1034.41 km2) is located in the high and very high-risk classes. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",NA,"10.1007/s12524-019-00981-z",2024-09-30 00:43:15,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6862991,"Monitoring And Mapping Of Rice Cropping Pattern In Flooding Area In The Vietnamese Mekong Delta Using Sentinel-1a Data: A Case Of An Giang Province","Cropping intensity is one of the most important decisions made independently by farmers in Vietnam. It is a crucial variable of various economic and process-based models. Rice is grown under irrigated triple- and double-rice cropping systems and a rainfed single-rice cropping system in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). These rice cropping systems are adopted according to the geographical location and water infrastructure. However, little work has been done to map triple-cropping of rice using Sentinel-1 along with the effects of water infrastructure on the rice cropping intensity decision. This study is focused on monitoring rice cropping patterns in the An Giang province of the VMD from March 2017 to March 2018. The fieldwork was carried out on the dates close to the Sentinel-1A acquisition. The results of dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1A data show a strong correlation with the spatial patterns of various rice growth stages and their association with the water infrastructure. The VH backscatter (sigma degrees) is strongly correlated with the three rice growth stages, especially the reproductive stage when the backscatter is less affected by soil moisture and water in the rice fields. In all three cropping patterns, sigma degrees VV and sigma degrees VH show the highest value in the maturity stage, often appearing 10 to 12 days before the harvesting of the rice. A rice cropping pattern map was generated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of Sentinel-1A data. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80.7\% with a 0.78 Kappa coefficient. Therefore, Sentinel-1A can be used to understand rice phenological changes as well as rice cropping systems using radar backscattering.","{""Avtar, Ram"",""Kurasaki, Masaaki"",""Minh, Huynh Vuong Thu"",""Misra, Prakhar"",""Mohan, Geetha""}","10.3390/ijgi8050211",2024-07-19 19:26:35,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{calibration}","{""rice phenology; water infrastructure; rice cropping pattern mapping; SAR backscattering""}"
6863391,"Satellite-Aided Land Mobile Radio Experiments, Applications And Problems","Radio communications between vehicles or individuals and base stations are essential to many public safety, law enforcement and commercial users in urban areas. Present day communications are limited to nearly line-of-sight distances from the vehicle or hand portable units to a base station or repeater. It is probable that many potential users in rural, remote and offshore areas would benefit if the communications were available everywhere on land and territorial waters. Geosynchronous satellites can serve as repeaters for mobile and personal radios, and they appear to be a cost effective means of providing the service. Voice bandwidth communication and automatic position monitoring of an automobile were tested using the VHF transponders of NASAs ATS-3 and ATS-1 satellites. Voice communications were reliable and position fixes were accurate to one fourth mile, with 0.3 mile precision of individual fixes. Demonstrations for potential users have included emergency medical voice and telemetry communications between ambulances and hospitals. While technical feasibility of satellite-aided mobile and personal communications has been demonstrated, and its potential value is appreciated by a small segment of the user community, many problems remain before an operational system could be implemented. Solutions to the problems require an experimental satellite with a multibeam antenna. The satellite or its associated ground terminals should incorporate computer controlled network switching to test demand assignment of channels. Prolonged experience by many users of the experimental satellite in their routine operations would aggregate user needs and define the capital investment that would be justified to implement a commercial operating system. © 1980.","{""Anderson, R.

6863230,"Evaluating Conservation Program Success With Landsat And Swat","In the United States, many state and federally funded conservation programs are required to quantify the water quality benefits resulting from their efforts. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of conservation practices subsidized by the Oklahoma Conservation Commission on phosphorus and sediment loads to Lake Wister. Conservation practices designed to increase vegetative cover in grazed pastures were evaluated using Landsat imagery and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Several vegetative indices were derived from Landsat imagery captured before and after the implementation of conservation practices. Collectively, these indicators provided an estimate of the change in vegetative soil cover attributable to conservation practices in treated fields. Field characteristics, management, and changes in vegetative cover were used in the SWAT model to simulate sediment and phosphorus losses before and after practice implementation. Overall, these conservation practices yielded a 1.9\% improvement in vegetative cover and a predicted sediment load reduction of 3.5\%. Changes in phosphorus load ranged from a 1.0\% improvement to a 3.5\% increase, depending upon initial vegetative conditions. The use of fertilizers containing phosphorus as a conservation practice in low-productivity pastures was predicted by SWAT to increase net phosphorus losses despite any improvement in vegetative cover. This combination of vegetative cover analysis and hydrologic simulation was a useful tool for evaluating the effects of conservation practices at the basin scale and may provide guidance for the selection of conservation measures subsidized in future conservation programs.","{""Busteed, Philip"",""Phillips, Shannon J."",""Stoodley, Scott"",""Storm, Daniel E."",""White, Michael J.""}","10.1007/s00267-010-9458-6",2024-07-12 19:33:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2010,"{}","{""SWAT; Modeling; Watershed management; Nutrients; Nonpoint source pollution; Remote sensing""}"

Currently, the heat risk study often focuses on the severity of heat risk to human health while the vegetation cooling is often ignored. Here, we proposed a new supply-demand matching model combining the vegetation cooling supply with the cooling demand induced by the high temperature. The cooling demand was assessed based on a heat exposure, population exposure, and heat vulnerability. The vegetation cooling supply was calculated by using a remote sensing-driven evapotranspiration (ET) model. Results showed: (1) The supply-demand matching model can identify cooling supply-demand mismatch zones in urban areas. (2) The vegetation ET model based on remote sensing can better represent the cooling benefits of vegetation compared to the vegetation abundance such as NDVI; (3) There was a special cluster of heat risk and cooling supply-demand mismatch in blocks of Beijing.

6862956,"Combining High-Resolution Images And Lidar Data To Model Ecosystem Services Perception In Compact Urban Systems","In this study, we aim to understand how the provision of ecosystem services (ESS) is spatially distributed within a compact urban system considering the structure and spatial arrangement of green spaces in relation to built-up areas and other infrastructures. For this purpose, we devised an approach to assess the ESS provided by urban green spaces through the integration of social data (i.e., stakeholders' perception of the multiple benefits of green spaces) with remotely sensed data, such as high-resolution satellite images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point-cloud. We developed a spatially explicit indicator (or metric) called Normalized Difference Green-Building Volume (NDGB), derived from remote sensing, that can be used to predict the way people perceive the ESS conveyed by green spaces in cities. We designed the NDGB metric using the city of Bad, Southern Italy, as a case example by involving four groups of stakeholders (n = 202) to assess ten urban green spaces. Our results show a strong positive relationship between the NDGB and the way stakeholders perceive the ESS provided by these urban green spaces. Thus, our indicator accurately expresses the relationship between stakeholders' perceptions of ESS provided by green spaces and the physical data (i.e., green space structure) produced by remote sensing technology. The green space most highly evaluated by the NDGB indicator, the periurban park ""Lama Balice"", was also the one on which all stakeholder group responses converged, including the group of NGOs and associations, which assigned average low scores for perceived ESS across all the green spaces presented in the study. The study was developed using the city of Bari in Southern Italy as testbed. There is a need to further extend and replicate our approach to other urban systems across different regions (e.g., Northern Europe, North America, Asia), especially those which are in the process of pursuing more sustainable green infrastructure planning and development, as they could be inclined to adopt our approach in ongoing decision making processes. We believe our approach can inform planners and decision makers on ESS provision and supply them with evidence of the local co-benefits of green spaces as well as of the spatial distribution of ESS within compact urban systems.","{""Giannico, Vincenzo"",""Lafortezza, Raffaele""}","10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.014",2024-07-17 21:49:51,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Green infrastructure; Urban green spaces; Scaling up; Remote sensing; Urban planning""}"

Yet estimates of the benefits of weather warning systems are sparse, perhaps because there is often no clear counterfactual of how individuals would have fared without a particular warning system. This paper enriches the literature and informs policy decisions by using conditional variation in the initial broadcast dates of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) transmitters to produce both cross-sectional and fixed effects estimates of the causal impact of expanding the NWR transmitter network. Results suggest that from 1970 to 2014, expanding NWR coverage to a previously untreated county was associated with an almost 40% reduction in injuries and as much as a 50% reduction in fatalities. The benefits associated with further expansion of this system have likely declined over time.","{""Miller, Benjamin M.""}","10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0093.1",NA,NA,NA,2018,"{duplicate}",NA

6863649,"Satellite Remote-Sensing Observations For Definitions Of Areas For Marine Conservation: Case Study Of The Scotian Slope, Eastern Canada","Characterizing offshore areas for marine conservation faces impediment from logistics and costs of in situ data collection. This study leveraged the high spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote-sensing ocean colour products, and the concept of biogeographical classification to delineate areas in the pelagic environment with application to marine conservation. Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada. We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004-2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define ""dynamic"" boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions. The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons. In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary. Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster. The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area. Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years. This methodology incorporates ocean-colour data and modelled estimates of multiple biological and physical characteristics to objectively refine areas of ecological interest at a spatial scale relevant for the management of marine conservation areas.","{""Breeze, H."",""Devred, E."",""McIver, R.""}","10.1016/j.rse.2018.05.017",2024-07-17 19:20:24,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Remote sensing; EBSA; Ecological provinces; Phytoplankton; Northwest Atlantic Ocean""}"
6863019,"New Methods For Studying The Spatiotemporal Variation Of Snow Cover Based On Combination Products Of Modis Terra And Aqua","Based on multi-day combination of Terra and Aqua MODIS snow cover products (cloud cover less than 10\%), this study developed new snow cover index (SCI), snow-covered duration/days (SCD) map, snow cover onset dates (SCOD) map and snow cover melting dates (SCMD) map, one each per hydrological year, to further examine the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover. Daily in situ snow depth observations in northern Xinjiang, China from 2001 to 2005 were used to validate the new maps. Our results indicate that the SCD maps had an overall agreement of 90\% with in situ observations of snow cover days at 20 stations in the study area, and the SCOD and SCMD maps also had good agreements with the in situ measurements, with a mean value of 1 week forward shift and 1 week back-ward shift, respectively, due to transient snowfall events in early fall and in late spring. The snow cover index (SCI) (km(2) day), first proposed here, contains both snow cover duration and extent for 1 hydrological year and indicates that the 2001-2002 hydrologic year had the most snow cover while the 2005-2006 had the least. While the SCD map provides the snow cover duration/days of each pixel in a hydrologic year, the SCOD and SCMD maps give specific dates when the snow cover begins and when it melts away at the pixel. Together, SCD, SCI, SCOD and SCMD can provide crucial information on spatiotemporal variation of snow cover conditions for any region of interest. This could potentially be critical information for local water agencies for planning water use and for mitigating snow-caused disaster. Long term availability of MODIS type of snow cover data for producing such datasets is key to study the connection between snow cover change and global climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

6863351,"Plant Life In Campo Rupestre: New Lessons From An Ancient Biodiversity Hotspot","The years 2011–2020 represent the United Nations Decade of Biodiversity, aiming to inspire worldwide actions to support biodiversity conservation. This Special Issue illustrates the current knowledge of plant life in campo rupestre, a megadiverse, highly-endemic vegetation complex, and one under alarming and unprecedented threats. The major research areas grouping the 27 contributions to the Special Issue are: i) plant diversity, ii) species coexistence, regeneration niche and climate change, iii) ecology of species interactions, iv) plant life on canga, and v) fire, regeneration ecology, and conservation. We highlight knowledge gaps in plant life in campo rupestre and suggest priority avenues of future research and steps forward to understand and preserve ancient ecosystems worldwide. Such efforts include the need to: 1) better assess the ecology of herbaceous species, 2) understand the effects of global change drivers on the vulnerability of endemic species, 3) understand how plant functional diversity and plant–animal interactions shape community structure and function, 4) apply new technologies (cameras, drones and remote sensing proxies) to understand plant phenology in space and time, 5) unravel diversification patterns and distinguish paleoendemism from neoendemism, 6) to disentangle the ecological and evolutionary role of fire, 7) gain insight into the factors that limit ecological restoration in degraded campo rupestre, 8) increase awareness and value of ecosystem services, 9) identify essential variables, key measures and areas to conserve campo rupestre, 10) promote reviews and research comparing old ecosystems. Therefore, burgeoning literature on campo rupestre will benefit from long-term multi- and trans-disciplinary research investigating a wide array of topics, from plant ecology to ecosystem functioning to biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. All knowledge must reach stakeholders, and it should be translated into an ecosystem services assessment for guiding the rational stewardship of campo rupestre and for benefiting local people. A key step forward in the understanding of plant life in campo rupestre is the OCBIL Theory (old, climatically-buffered, infertile landscapes), which provides a theoretical framework of testable hypotheses and cross-continental comparisons. We anticipate this Special Issue will foster collaborative research leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of one of the world's most ancient ecosystems. © 2017","{""Morellato, L. P.

6903473,"Developments In Organ Preserving Treatments For Renal Cell Cancer: Open Surgery","Recent trends in cancer surgery have shown that the same cure rates can be achieved with more organ and tissue sparing techniques and multimodal approaches. Developments in technology and better patient care now render most operations to be possible. In the past radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) used to save many lives because most of the patients were presenting at advanced stages. Thanks to modern imaging techniques and health awareness of the public, today, most of the patients are presenting with small incidentally detected renal masses. Apart from patients requiring organ preservation for absolute and relative indications, most patients today are enjoying the benefits of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in an elective setting. The crucial step in NSS is to get control of the renal vessels first and to expose the whole kidney to look for satellite cortical lesions. A safe rim of healthy tissue has to be removed together with the tumor. All bleeders are sutured, and if the collecting system is entered, it should be repaired. The parenchyma is sutured for approximation with absorbable sutures. The long term results with NSS show acceptable oncological outcome. The rate of complications of NSS has dramatically decreased with better patient selection, improved techniques and better management. All patients should be informed of the complications, recurrence rates and follow-up conditions. The advances in laparoscopic techniques now render NSS possible in selected patients. However, this is an extremely challenging operation, and can only be performed in expert hands. New technology is also emerging utilizing new forms of energy for tumor destruction and ultimately for nephron sparing approaches in localized RCC. As we are detecting more small renal masses, some of which are benign, NSS will remain to be the treatment of choice for these patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

6863377,"Modelling Landscape Vulnerability To The Bracken Fern (Pteridium Aquilinum) Invasion In A Remnant Urban Sandstone Sourveldt Grassland Ecosystem","The Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) is one of the world's most pervasive alien invasive plants, exerting adverse effects on the sustainability and balance of remnant urban green ecosystems and thereby threatening the provision of valuable ecological goods and services in urban landscapes. To identify vulnerable landscapes and future distribution of the fern, this study aimed to model landscape vulnerability to the Bracken fern invasion using bio-physical, climatic, and remotely sensed data using Maxent species distribution model. Furthermore, the study sought to evaluate the value of variable selection on Maxent's modelling performance. Vulnerability to invasion was modelled based on four scenarios of different bio-climatic, physical and remotely sensed data inputs and model performance assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The results show that Model 1 (topographic variables) and Model 2 (topographic variables and Sentinel-2 spectral bands) predicted the western part of the eThekwini Municipal as highly suitable for the Bracken fern invasion, while Model 3 (topographic and bio-climatic variables) and Model 4 (topographic variables, Sentinel-2 spectral bands and bio-climatic variables), i.e., all variables predicted the central and western parts of the area as highly vulnerable to the Bracken fern invasion. Results also showed that elevation and rainfall wettest month (Bio13) were the most influential variables in determining the potential spread of the Bracken fern invasion and the model built using solely topographic and all the variables had the lowest (AUC of 0.895) and highest (AUC of 0.978) performance.

6863313,"Cost-Efficiency Assessments Of Marine Monitoring Methods Lack Rigor—A Systematic Mapping Of Literature And An End-User View On Optimal Cost-Efficiency Analysis","Global deterioration of marine ecosystems, together with increasing pressure to use them, has created a demand for new, more efficient and cost-efficient monitoring tools that enable assessing changes in the status of marine ecosystems. However, demonstrating the cost-efficiency of a monitoring method is not straightforward as there are no generally applicable guidelines. Our study provides a systematic literature mapping of methods and criteria that have been proposed or used since the year 2000 to evaluate the cost-efficiency of marine monitoring methods. We aimed to investigate these methods but discovered that examples of actual cost-efficiency assessments in literature were rare, contradicting the prevalent use of the term “cost-efficiency.” We identified five different ways to compare the cost-efficiency of a marine monitoring method: (1) the cost–benefit ratio, (2) comparative studies based on an experiment, (3) comparative studies based on a literature review, (4) comparisons with other methods based on literature, and (5) subjective comparisons with other methods based on experience or intuition. Because of the observed high frequency of insufficient cost–benefit assessments, we strongly advise that more attention is paid to the coverage of both cost and efficiency parameters when evaluating the actual cost-efficiency of novel methods. Our results emphasize the need to improve the reliability and comparability of cost-efficiency assessments.

6863232,"Random Forest Regression Model For Estimation Of The Growing Stock Volumes In Georgia, Usa, Using Dense Landsat Time Series And Fia Dataset","The forest volumes are essential as they are directly related to the economic and environmental values of the forests. Satellite-based forest volume estimation was first developed in the 1990s, and the accuracy of the estimation has been improved over time. One of the satellite-based forest volume estimation issues is that it tends to overestimate the large volume class and underestimate the small volume class. Free availability of the major satellite imagery and the development of cloud-based computational platforms facilitate an immense amount of satellite imagery in the estimation. In this paper, we set three objectives: (1) to examine whether the long Landsat time series contributes to the improvement of the estimation accuracy, (2) to explore the effectiveness of forest disturbance record and land cover data as ancillary spatial data on the accuracy of the estimation, and (3) to apply the bias correction method to reduce the bias of the estimation. We computed three Tasseled-cap components from the Landsat data for preparation of short (2014–2016) and long (1984–2016) time series. Each data entity was analyzed with harmonic regressions resulting in the coefficients and the fitted values recorded as pixel values in a multilayer raster database. Data included Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) unit field inventory measurements provided by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the National Land Cover Database and disturbance history data added as ancillary information. The totality of the available data was organized into seven distinct Random Forest (RF) models with different variables compared against each other to identify the ones with the most satisfactory performance. A bias correction method was then applied to all the RF models to examine the effectiveness of the method. Among the seven models, the worst one used the coefficients and fitted values of the short Landsat time series only, and the best one used coefficients and fitted values of both short and long Landsat time series. Using the Out-of-bag (OOB) score, the best model was found to be 34.4% better than the worst one. The model that used only the long time series data had almost the same OOB score as the best model. The results indicate that the use of the long Landsat time series improves model performance. Contrary to the previous research employing forest disturbance data as a feature variable had almost no effect on OOB. The bias correction method reduced the relative size of the bias in the estimates of the best model from 3.79% to −1.47%, the bottom 10% bias by 12.5 points, and the top 10% bias by 9.9 points. Depending on the types of forest, important feature variables were differed, reflecting the relationship between the time series remote sensing data we computed for this research and the forests’ phenological characteristics. The availability of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and accessibility of the precise locations of the FIA data are likely to improve the model estimates further. © 2021 by the authors.

6863489,"Linking Critical Zone With Watershed Science: The Example Of The Heihe River Basin","Watersheds are the basic unit of Earth's terrestrial systems and are therefore ideal units for the study of critical zones (CZs). However, grand challenges remain regarding the observation, modeling, and management of CZs and watershed systems. We synthesize the progress and breakthroughs associated with watershed science and CZ research in the Heihe River basin (HRB), a large-scale endorheic river basin with unique mountain cryosphere-oasis-desert landscapes and prominent human-nature competition for water resources. The HRB observation system consists of mountain cryosphere, agricultural oasis, and natural oasis observatories and is promoted by large-scale comprehensive experiments to achieve multiscale observations. A watershed system model that couples ecohydrological models with socioeconomic models is developed to investigate the complex interactions among water, ecology, and socioeconomics in the HRB. The model is embedded in a decision support system to bridge science and decision-making and to better serve river basin sustainability. Significant progress and breakthroughs have been made in CZ and watershed process research (e.g., cryospheric hydrological processes, ecological and hydrological interactions, and surface-groundwater interactions) in the HRB. Nevertheless, observation and modeling of geochemical and geomorphological processes in the CZ have not been well addressed in integrated watershed studies of the HRB. In the future, new observation technologies, agent-based models, machine learning, and data assimilation will benefit both watershed science and CZ science and help to address complexity and dynamics in the CZ at the river basin scale. Overall, the HRB has successfully demonstrated how an experimental river basin can link CZ science with watershed science.","{""Che, Tao"",""Cheng, Guodong"",""Fu, Bojie"",""Kang, Shaozhong"",""Li, Xiaoyan"",""Li, Xin"",""Li, Xiubin"",""Liu, Shaomin"",""Ran, Youhua"",""Song, Changqing"",""Wang, Haibo"",""Xia, Jun"",""Yang, Dawen"",""Zhang, Ling"",""Zheng, Chunmiao"",""Zheng, Yi"",""Zhou, Yanzhao""}","10.1029/2022ef002966",2024-09-30 01:47:55,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""watershed science; critical zone; observation; remote sensing; watershed system model; data assimila""}"
6863316,"Willow Cover As A Stream-Recovery Indicator Under A Conservation Grazing Plan","Many rangeland streams and associated fisheries have suffered from livestock grazing as a cost of upland-forage utilization. Due to damage from intensive usage, restoration of damaged streams is now a common land-management objective. The Squaw Valley Ranch of Elko County, Nevada, US, in cooperation with the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Barrick Gold Corp., is attempting to improve those portions of the Rock Creek watershed negatively affected by past ranch operations. The watershed includes both historical and occupied habitat for the threatened Lahonton cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi {[}Richardson]). From 2003, and continuing to the present, hot-season livestock grazing on Squaw Valley Ranch private and permitted public-land riparian areas was greatly reduced. To assess the effectiveness of this conservation effort, we (1) evaluated BLM archived images of riparian photo points in the watershed, (2) tested for change over time using data from systematic, intermittent, aerial sampling that acquired 2-cm resolution images from low-altitude surveys conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2006, and (3) compared Landsat scenes of the area from before and after 2003. Willow (Salix spp.) cover was chosen as the primary ecological indictor of riparian condition and we introduce willow canopy (m(2)) per m of stream length in the image field-of-view, as a practical measure of willow status. Archived images from photo points show mostly low-condition riparian plant communities, often with little or no willow canopy evident before 2003, but with conspicuous improvement thereafter. This subjective perception is supported by objective analyses finding, (1) the relative increase in willow cover nearly tripled on one stream, more than doubled on three others, and increased on all but one (fire affected) and (2) a highly significant post-2003 increase in willows in the Landsat record. Thus, the post-2003 increase in willow cover documented in three complementary lines of evidence from ground, air, and space support the predicted ecological benefits of reduced hot-season riparian grazing and the utility of 2-cm imagery as a tool for assessing watershed-wide conservation benefits from a federal cost-share-eligible conservation practice. This appears to be the first use of willow measurements from an aerial survey as a particular indicator of riparian condition and trend and the first demonstration of change detection based on objective measurements from a watershed-scale riparian monitoring effort that used systematic sampling (versus subjective selection) and high sample density to address the large Type II error (false negative) risk common to conventional land-management survey efforts.

However, tourism may also play positive roles in natural resource conservation, which has rarely been verified in practice, although some researchers have demonstrated this in theory. In this article, taking the Jiuzhaigou Biosphere Reserve as a case study area, we conducted an analysis for the environmental impacts from tourism development based on social survey and interpretation of remote sensing images. The results show that the natural environment was not degraded and some indicators are even improving because all the residents have participated in tourism and given up farming and hunting.

6691720,"Weather satellites and the economic value of forecasts: evidence from the electric power industry","Data from weather satellites have become integral to the weather forecast process in the United States and abroad. Satellite data are used to derive improved forecasts for short-term routine weather, long-term climate change, and for predicting natural disasters. The resulting forecasts have saved lives, reduced weather-related economic losses, and improved the quality of life. Weather information routinely assists in managing resources more e0ciently and reducing industrial operating costs. The electric energy industry in particular makes extensive use of weather information supplied by both government and commercial suppliers. Through direct purchases of weather data and information, and through participating in the increasing market for weather derivatives, this sector provides measurable indicators of the economic importance of weather information. Space weather in the form of magnetic disturbances caused by coronal mass ejections from the sun creates geomagnetically induced currents that disturb the electric power grid, sometimes causing signi4cant economic impacts on electric power distribution. This paper examines the use of space-derived weather information on the U.S. electric power industry. It also explores issues that may impair the most optimum use of the information and reviews the longer-term opportunities for employing weather data acquired from satellites in future commercial and government activity.","{""Hertzfeld, Henry""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2004.05.015",2024-04-26 23:11:01,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2004,"{""space weather""}",NA

6691683,"Potential value of GCM-based seasonal rainfall forecasts for maize management in semi-arid Kenya","We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October–February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions – representing upper and lower bounds of predictability – and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15–30% of the average gross value of production and 24–69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study’s assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.","{""Hansen, James""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2009.03.005",2024-04-25 02:33:30,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2009,"{}","{""General circulation model (GCM)|Seasonal climate forecast|Crop simulation models|Risk|Kenya""}"
6862887,"Assessment Of Spatial And Temporal Variation In No2 Levels Over Tourist Reception Areas In Poland","Featured Application: Recognizing the temporal and spatial variation in NO2 pollution will allow more effective management of tourist reception areas. Air quality in tourist reception areas can be a significant health concern. It also plays an increasingly important role when it comes to choosing tourist destinations. NO2 is a harmful gas that can cause an increased number of cancer or respiratory diseases. The development of satellite remote sensing techniques now enables a much broader spectrum of air quality analysis than mere point measurements at environment monitoring stations. In the study, the spatial diversity of nitrogen dioxide air pollution over tourist reception areas in Poland was assessed. The lowest pollution was found in national parks and tourist regions. The most polluted air was found in tourist reception areas located near industrial regions and large urban agglomerations. Temporal variation—annual and monthly—and spatial variation were determined (for the period 2019–2021). The highest concentrations, exceeding the WHO recommended value (40 μmol/m2), occurred in the winter and autumn. Low pollution was found in most reception areas in the summer (except cities). In 2020, due to restrictions related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the NO2 pollution decreased (10–20%). In the cold half of the year (October–April), NO2 concentrations greater than 40 μmol/m2 occurred for about 20% of national parks, 50% of health resorts, 30% of tourist regions, and 100% of provincial capitals. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Mochocki, D."",""Zgłobicki, W.""}","10.3390/app13169477",2024-07-17 19:37:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""air pollution"",""health risk"",""protected areas"",tourism,wellbeing}"
6903572,"Effects Of Long-Term Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Ecosystem Service Values: An Example From The Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia","Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the world. The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs). Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. Additionally, the study facilitated the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs in the Central Rift Valley. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1973 and 2020 using four Landsat images from 1973, 1990, 2005 and 2020. The value transfer valuation method was used to estimate the changes in ESVs due to LULC changes. Among the seven major identified LULC classes, farmlands, settlements, and bare lands showed positive changes, while forestlands, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the last 47 years. The expansion of farmlands, for example, has occurred at the expense of grasslands, forestlands and shrublands. The changes in LULC over a period of 47 years resulted in a total loss of US \$62,110.4 x 10(6) in ESVs. The contributors to the overall loss of ESVs in decreasing order are provisioning services (US \$33,795.1 x 10(6)), cultural services (US \$28,981.5 x 10(6)) and regulating services (US \$652.9 x 10(6)). The results imply that addressing the degradation of land and water resources is crucial to reversing the loss of ecosystem services and achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG 15).",NA,"10.3390/land10121373",2024-09-26 01:03:08,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863564,"The Drawing Of A National Blue Product Space And Its Evolution","As countries transition to a blue economy to increase the long-term benefits of the sustainable use of marine resources, the different pathways toward the blue growth engine depend on identifying profitable ocean-related sectors and activities that offer advantages when competing with other countries. The ability to identify and establish the processes of blue product exports can be viewed as an essential part of a long-term strategy aimed at supporting blue growth and sustainable development. This paper proposes a method for defining a blue product space based on the product space model introduced by Hidalgo et al. in 2007, which is used to draw and analyze export strengths and the evolution of different countries with respect to a list of blue products. Although this descriptive analysis addresses only a small part of the overall concept of blue economy/growth, the method can identify blue products that may be competitive or potentially competitive in the world market by analyzing product export performance. An example from China is used to clarify the method of drawing the blue product space and analyzing its evolution, which is followed by a discussion of the method's limitations and possible contributions to policymakers and stakeholders when formulating blue industry policies.","{""Qi, Xiaofei"",""Xiao, Wenwen"",""Zhang, Jianghua"",""Zhao, Bingxin""}","10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103773",2024-07-19 23:39:35,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2020,"{}","{""Product space; Blue economy; Blue product; Evolution; Sustainable development; Exports""}"
6862976,"Implications Of Changing Urban Land Use On The Livelihoods Of Local People In Northwestern Bangladesh","Bangladesh is one of the emerging economies in the Global South, and rapid urbanization is the driving force behind its economic development. Urban growth and development are closely associated with land use/land cover changes in any area, which sometimes negatively affect the livelihood and wellbeing of local people. We investigated the impacts of urban land use changes on the local people of northwestern Bangladesh using Nilphamari Sadar as a case study site. In order to identify land use patterns and variations in land cover, a 10-year period of land use/land cover changes from 2000 to 2020 was monitored using satellite imagery and the supervised classification method. Primary data were collected through household surveys and focus group discussions. Our analysis suggests that land use has changed over the past 20 years in the study area. As a result, the land area under settlements has substantially increased from 19 square kilometers in 2000 to 48 square kilometers in 2020. Waterbodies were 24 square kilometers in 2010, dropping to 4 square kilometers in 2020, whereas croplands decreased to 218 square kilometers in 2020 from 259 square kilometers in 2000. These changes have proportionately and adversely affected the lives and livelihoods of the local people by altering their longstanding traditional livelihood options, limiting their access to common resources, failing to adapt to new environmental arrangements and economic structures, and creating new forms of vulnerability. We suggest that urban planning processes should consider local people's interests with the entitlement of local and marginalized people to the benefits generated by urbanization.","{""Huq, Hamidul"",""Mukul, Sharif A.

6903558,"Improved Understanding Of Vegetation Dynamics And Wetland Ecohydrology Via Monthly Uav-Based Classification","Vegetation classification is an essential prerequisite for understanding vegetation-water relations at a range of spatial scales. However, in site-specific applications, such classifications were mostly based on a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight, which can be challenging in grasslands and/or herbaceous-dominated systems, as those communities are small in size and highly mixed. Here, we conducted monthly UAV flights for two years in a riparian wetland in Germany, with acquired imagery used for vegetation classification on a monthly basis under different strategies (with or without auxiliary information from other flights) to increase understanding in ecohydrology. The results show that multi-flight-based classification outperformed single-flight-based classification due to the higher classification accuracy. Moreover, improved sensitivity of temporal changes in community distribution highlights the benefits of multi-flight-based classification - providing a more comprehensive picture of community evolution. From reference to the monthly community distribution, we argue that a combination of two or three flights in early- and late-summer is enough to achieve comparable results to monthly flights, while mid-summer would be a better timing in case only one flight is scheduled. With such detailed vegetation mapping, we further interpreted the complex spatio-temporal heterogeneity in NDVI and explored the dominant areas and developmental progress of each community. Impacts from management (mowing events) were also evaluated based on the different responses between communities in two years. Finally, we explored how such vegetation mapping could help understand landscape ecohydrology, and found that the spatio-temporal distribution of minimal soil moisture was related to NDVI peaks of local community, while grass distribution was explained by both topography and low moisture conditions. Such bi-directional relationships proved that apart from contributing to an evidence base for wetland management, multi-flight UAV vegetation mapping could also provide fundamental insights into the ecohydrology of wetlands. © 2023 The Authors.

6863700,"Ecological Conditions Influence Sentinel Decisions","Ecological conditions can influence decisions relating to antipredator behaviour through impacts on the likelihood of detecting predators and the ability to hear vocalizations. Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

In this study, an early landslide detection method based on the D-InSAR technique is proposed. First, SAR data are used to monitor landslide deformation in the Wudongde hydropower reservoir. Then, the ground surface deformation is derived by using the D-InSAR technique, which includes both soil and non-soil deformations. To remove the non-soil deformation, the vertical deformation filter method and slope deformation filter method for extracting soil deformations are established, and the error of D-InSAR results is analyzed. By using two methods, Permanent Scatterers InSAR and Corner Reflectors InSAR, the errors caused by the atmospheric delay are estimated quantitatively. Additionally, the relationship between the landslide deformation and the temporal-spatial change of the SAR data is analyzed, and used to identify landslides. Finally, through the proposed early landslide detection method, the Jinpingzi landslide in the Wudongde area is investigated to validate the proposed method, and the other unknown landslides in this area are also detected, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method.

6862732,"The Effects Of Climate And Land Use On British Bumblebees: Findings From A Decade Of Citizen-Science Observations","Bumblebees are important pollinators but are suffering from population declines due to land use intensification and climate change. In-depth knowledge of species' relationships with different land use and climate variables is invaluable to guide conservation efforts, as well as enable predictions to be made about the impacts of future changes in these variables. Here we use 10 years of bumblebee abundance data from the UK, collected by citizen scientists as part of the BeeWalk scheme, to investigate associations between 14 bumblebee species and various land use, habitat and climate variables. National-scale land cover and climate data were complemented with observer-collected habitat data. Bumblebee presence and abundance showed strong relationships with environmental variables. However, interspecific variation was far stronger than commonalities, which suggests that targeted conservation work is required to effectively safeguard particular species. Within species, we found evidence of different habitat associations between reproductive and worker castes. The results also showed that wetland and riparian habitats had consistently positive associations with a number of species, while semi-natural, arable and urban areas had strongly species-specific associations. Synthesis and applications. This study reveals strong effects of specific habitats occurring within broad land cover types on the presence and abundance of bumblebees, with several distinct habitats having importance for different species and castes. Consequently, conservation efforts need to be carefully tailored to particular species. Nevertheless, reversing the loss of semi-natural areas such as wetlands may be the single most generally effective action for bumblebee conservation while improving habitats in urban and arable areas could benefit particular (rare) species. Our results also suggest that the combination of long-term, detailed monitoring data of both species and habitats, here collected by citizen scientists, with remotely sensed landcover and climate data is essential to extend knowledge of species' habitat requirements and to support future research and conservation. © 2022 The Authors.

As a response, transparency and inclusiveness became a major focus of regulatory science activities in the GMO impact area. Nevertheless, nearly three decades of controversies resulted in a heavily polarized policy environment, calling for further efforts. Against this backdrop the EU funded project GRACE explored the value of evidence synthesis approaches for GMO impact assessment and developed an evidence synthesis framework with a strong emphasis on openness, stakeholder engagement, transparency, and responsiveness to tackle regulatory science challenges. This framework was tested and implemented in the course of 14 systematic reviews or maps conducted on selected review questions spanning potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of GMOs. An inclusive development and pri-oritisation of review questions is of key importance in evidence synthesis as it helps to provide a better link between stakeholder demands and concerns and policy relevant outcomes. This paper, therefore, places a particular focus on the stakeholder involvement strategy developed and experiences gathered during this particular step in the course of the GRACE project.

Most sites reached their maximum greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments, 2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive rangelands at the expense of forested lands. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","{""Potter, C.""}","10.1007/s11852-014-0308-1",2024-07-19 18:21:11,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{}","{California,""Central Coast"",""Coastal climate""}"

6862739,"Contribution Of Phytoecological Data To Spatialize Soil Erosion: Application Of The Rusle Model In The Algerian Atlas","Among the models used to assess water erosion, the RUSLE model is commonly used. Policy makers can act on cover (C-factor) and conservation practice (P-factor) to reduce erosion, with less costly action on soil surface characteristics. However, the widespread use of vegetation indices such as NDVI does not allow for a proper assessment of the C-factor in drylands where stones, crusted surfaces and litter strongly influence soil protection. Two sub-factors of C, canopy cover (CC) and soil cover (SC), can be assessed from phytoecological measurements that include gravel-pebbles cover, physical mulch, annual and perennial vegetation. This paper introduces a method to calculate the C-factor from phytoecological data and, in combination with remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), to map it over large areas. A supervised classification, based on field phytoecological data, is applied to radiometric data from Landsat-8/OLI satellite images. Then, a C-factor value, whose SC and CC subfactors are directly derived from the phytoecological measurements, is assigned to each land cover unit. This method and RUSLE are implemented on a pilot region of 3828 km(2) of the Saharan Atlas, composed of rangelands and steppe formations, and intended to become an observatory. The protective effect against erosion by gravel-pebbles (50\%) is more than twice that of vegetation (23\%). The C-factor derived from NDVI (0.67) is higher and more evenly distributed than that combining these two contributions (0.37 on average). Finally, priorities are proposed to decision-makers by crossing the synthetic map of erosion sensitivity and a decision matrix of management priorities.

6863149,"Synergistic Use Of Landsat 8 Oli Image And Airborne Lidar Data For Above-Ground Biomass Estimation In Tropical Lowland Rainforests","Developing a robust and cost-effective method for accurately estimating tropical forest's carbon pool over large area is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). This study aims at examining the independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to accurately estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) of primary tropical rainforests in Sabah, Malaysia. Thirty field plots were established in three types of lowland rainforests: alluvial, sandstone hill and heath forests that represent a wide range of AGB density and stand structure. We derived the height percentile and laser penetration variables from the airborne LiDAR and calculated the vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation values, and the texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data. We found that there are moderate correlations between the AGB and laser penetration variables from airborne LiDAR data (r = −0.411 to −0.790). For Landsat 8 OLI data, the 6 vegetation indices and the 46 texture measures also significantly correlated with the AGB (r = 0.366–0.519). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the estimation models for independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI data. The results showed that the model based on a combination of the two remote sensing data achieved the highest accuracy (R2adj = 0.81, RMSE = 17.36%) whereas the models using Landsat 8 OLI data airborne LiDAR data independently obtained the moderate accuracy (R2adj = 0.52, RMSE = 24.22% and R2adj = 0.63, RMSE = 25.25%, respectively). Our study indicated that texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data provided useful information for AGB estimation and synergistic use of Landsat 8 OLI and airborne LiDAR data could improve the AGB estimation of primary tropical rainforest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","{""Coomes, D.

6863007,"Fine Identification And Biomass Estimation Of Mangroves Based On Uav Multispectral And Lidar","Mangroves are special types of woody plants that grow exclusively in the intertidal zones of the tropics and the subtropics. With respect to environmental and ecological values, mangroves protect the shoreline from tides, winds, and storms and act as the first line of defense against extreme weather in coastal areas. Moreover, mangroves have a continuous carbon fixation capacity, which is much higher than those of peat swamp and coastal salt marsh. Mangroves are an important part of the earth carbon cycle system and considered an important blue carbon sink on the sea and land margin. However, mangrove habitat is threatened all over the world due to human development and utilization activities. Therefore, monitoring the spatial distribution of mangrove types and biomass will help guide policy-makers in taking effective utilization and protection measures. In this paper, on the basis of UAV multispectral images and LiDAR point cloud data, the support vector machine classification method is used for mangrove identification. Furthermore, mangrove species are distinguished according to different heights and distribution areas using the elevation information in the UAV LiDAR point cloud data. The structure characteristics of mangrove single wood are extracted by the point-cloud-based cluster segmentation method, and an estimation model of the tree height, canopy, and aboveground biomass obtained by LiDAR remote sensing is constructed, Finally, the aboveground biomass of mangrove in the study area is calculated, and its spatial distribution information is analyzed. The classification result of the species types of mangroves, which is combined with the multi spectrum and LiDAR point cloud data, can reach 90.69% in total accuracy. The kappa coefficient is 0.88. The accuracies of the algorithm in identifying single trees of Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculata are 86.71% and 60.21%, respectively. Among them, the middle errors of the heights of K. candel and A. corniculata are 0.36 and 0.18 m, respectively, and the crown width extraction precision of K. candel is higher than that of A. corniculata. The regression models of the aboveground biomass of K. candel and A. corniculata are constructed. The accuracy of the fusion model is the highest, and the respective decision coefficients (R²) are 0.678 and 0.832 for K. candel and A. corniculata. Mangroves are mostly planted artificially in the study area and distributed in a belt perpendicular to the dam: K. candel—Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Acanthus ilicifolius L. —A. corniculata. The area of A. corniculata is the largest, which is approximately 8.91 hm2 and distributed on both sides of the tidal ditch far from the dam. The area of K. candel is 4.69 hm2, which is distributed in the area near the dam. C. malaccensis Lam. and A. ilicifolius L. are scattered in small areas among the different types of objects. The aboveground biomass of mangrove is calculated by the estimation model of above ground biomass. The aboveground biomass follows the order Sonneratia apetala > A. corniculata > C. malaccensis Lam. > K. candel > A. ilicifolius L.

6862792,"Land Use Optimization Through Bridging Multiobjective Optimization And Multicriteria Decision-Making Models (Case Study: Tilabad Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran)","This study aims to present an efficient methodology for land use optimization based on minimization of runoff and sediment and maximization of economic benefits, occupational opportunities, and land use suitability in the Tilabad watershed in northeast of Iran. The land use map of the area was prepared using the Landsat satellite images and field surveys. The amounts of runoff and sediment were estimated via SWAT model. The TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was applied on the results of the multiobjective optimization (MOO) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to choose the final optimal solution among the Pareto solutions front generated by MOO. The results indicated that the area of agriculture and rangelands should decrease, and the area of forests should increase to achieve the defined objectives. Overall, results indicated that integration of MOO and MCDM provides an efficient procedure for land use optimization in a complex watershed. Recommendations for Resource Managers The optimization of land use allocation across a complex watershed requires the combined application of several models and techniques to achieve a sustainable decision-making process. By optimization of land use patterns according to the final solution, the surface runoff and sediment load of the watershed will decline, while the economic profit and land use suitability will improve. Despite using a maximization objective function, the land-based job opportunities might decrease across a watershed by optimization of land use allocation, but this can be considered as an opportunity for provision of manpower to other socioeconomic sectors.","{""Fathabadi, Abolhasan"",""Mahiny, Abdolrassoul Salman"",""Ownegh, Majid"",""Salmani, Hossein"",""Sheikh, Vahedberdi""}","10.1111/nrm.12301",2024-07-15 15:54:57,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""genetic algorithm NSGA\\&\\#8208; II; land use planning; multiple objective programming; SWAT; the Til""}"
6862757,"From Landsat To Leafhoppers: A Multidisciplinary Approach For Sustainable Stocking Assessment And Ecological Monitoring In Mountain Grasslands","We present a case study illustrating a multidisciplinary approach for characterizing, mapping and monitoring the bio-ecological properties of Mediterranean mountain grasslands in extensive grazing systems. The approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including 22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data. Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type, intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity, respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for monitoring the actual ""sustainability"" of livestock loads on different aspects of grassland ecosystems.

Here, NDVI, EVI, GI, LAI, PVI, SI, BI and NDMI have been used to assess vegetation status (VS). Indices have been classified into five categories following natural breaks classification method. Apart from BI, all the indices represented higher value in forest cover area. Weights for all the themes and sub-themes were assigned following multi-criteria decision analysis with consistency ratio of 0.0685, and weighted overlay analysis technique had been employed for the assessment of the vegetation status. Very low, low and moderate VS was found mainly over the water body, urban and agricultural area, which is covering more than half of the basin. The rest of the area is covered with high and very high VS, representing fragmented and dense Sal forest and covering 15.81\% and 22.88\% basin area, respectively. Accuracy assessment and thorough field verification were done with 90.43\% classification accuracy. Our result is quite similar to land use land cover map of Bhuvan, ISRO.

6691589,"Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES): A framework for monitoring environmental changes from Earth Observations","Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale.This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.","{""Giuliani, Gregory""}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.040",2024-04-23 21:59:20,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""Earth Observations|Big Data|Monitoring|Environmental changes|Sustainable development|Interoperabilit""}"
6863383,"Forests And Trees: A Public Health Perspective","Forests have historically supplied humans with timber, fuel, and forage. They have also provided goods and services associated with human physical, mental, social, and spiritual health. Given competing priorities for funding in healthcare, research on forests and health is important from a health economics perspective. Engagement with forests (including wilderness areas, managed production forests, and urban forests) for enhanced human health and wellbeing, and perhaps for illness prevention at a fraction of the cost of medical interventions, is a major opportunity for forest management in the 21st century. Despite this general recognition, there is a lack of information regarding public health policies and approaches that exist in relation to forests and trees. The available literature suggests that the majority in the field of public health view the natural environment with ambivalence. However, a paradigm shift is underway and there is an emerging field working with the positive impacts that trees and forests have on human health and wellbeing. While the value of forests has been noted by many health practitioners in Europe and Japan, health practitioners and the associated health industry in North America remain largely focused on treatment rather than preventative approaches. Largely as a result of advocacy from forestry and recreational organizations, this view is beginning to change, but the focus in the healthcare industry on treatment rather than prevention remains deeply entrenched. © S.F.S.P.. Tous droits réservés pour tous pays.; Historiquement, les forêts ont été une source de bois de construction, de combustible et de fourrage pour les sociétés humaines. Elles leur ont également fourni des biens et services liés à la santé physique, mentale, sociale et spirituelle. Compte tenu des priorités concurrentes pour le financement des soins de santé, la recherche sur les forêts et la santé est importante dans une perspective d’économie de la santé. La fréquentation des forêts (y compris les zones sauvages, les forêts exploitées et les forêts urbaines) pour améliorer la santé et le bien-être de l’homme, et peut-être pour prévenir les maladies à une fraction du coût des interventions médicales, constitue un important débouché pour la gestion forestière au xxie siècle. Bien que ces bienfaits soient largement reconnus, on constate un manque d’information en ce qui concerne les politiques et les approches de santé publique en relation avec les forêts et les arbres. La littérature disponible suggère que la majorité des acteurs dans le domaine de la santé publique ont une perception ambivalente de l’environnement naturel. Cependant, un changement de paradigme est en cours, et un nouveau domaine de recherche s’intéresse aux impacts positifs des arbres et des forêts sur la santé et le bien-être humains. Alors qu’en Europe et au Japon, de nombreux praticiens de la santé soulignent les vertus de la forêt, les professionnels de la santé et l’industrie de la santé associée en Amérique du Nord restent largement axés sur le traitement plutôt que sur des approches préventives. Ce point de vue commence à changer – en grande partie grâce au plaidoyer de la foresterie et des organisations de loisirs – mais la priorité au traitement plutôt qu’à la prévention reste une attitude profondément ancrée dans l’industrie de la santé. © S.F.S.P..

6691536,"Monitoring sustainable development by means of earth observation data and machine learning: a review","This paper presents and explores the different Earth Observation approaches and their contribution to the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A review on the Sustainable Development concept and its goals is presented followed by Earth Observation approaches relevant to this field, giving special attention to the contribution of Machine Learning methods and algorithms as well as their potential and capabilities to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, it is observed that Earth Observation plays a key role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals given its cost-effectiveness pertaining to data acquisition on all scales and information richness. Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.","{""Ferreira, Bruno""}","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00397-4",2024-04-18 19:14:12,"excluded","{""Value is not measured""}",2020,"{}","{""Sustainable development|Sustainable development goals|Earth observation data|Machine learning""}"
6863524,"Selection Of Independent Variables For Crop Yield Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network Models With Remote Sensing Data","Knowing the expected crop yield in the current growing season provides valuable information for farmers, policy makers, and food processing plants. One of the main benefits of using reliable forecasting tools is generating more income from grown crops. Information on the amount of crop yielding before harvesting helps to guide the adoption of an appropriate strategy for managing agricultural products. The difficulty in creating forecasting models is related to the appropriate selection of independent variables. Their proper selection requires a perfect knowledge of the research object. The following article presents and discusses the most commonly used independent variables in agricultural crop yield prediction modeling based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Particular attention is paid to environmental variables, such as climatic data, air temperature, total precipitation, insolation, and soil parameters. The possibility of using plant productivity indices and vegetation indices, which are valuable predictors obtained due to the application of remote sensing techniques, are analyzed in detail. The paper emphasizes that the increasingly common use of remote sensing and photogrammetric tools enables the development of precision agriculture. In addition, some limitations in the application of certain input variables are specified, as well as further possibilities for the development of non-linear modeling, using artificial neural networks as a tool supporting the practical use of and improvement in precision farming techniques.","{""Hara, Patryk"",""Niedbala, Gniewko"",""Piekutowska, Magdalena""}","10.3390/land10060609",2024-07-17 21:35:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""crop yield prediction; independent variables; ANN; remote sensing""}"
6903557,"Forecasting Models For Surface Water Quality Using Predictive Analytics","Modeling surface water quality has become crucial in providing better strategies for managing surface water resources, and adequate findings need accurate and geographically dispersed data. Hydrogeological modeling of these data sets is possible using empirically-based models. The other statistical models are also an alternative approach. In this study, a process with maximum probability is considered with the help of machine learning tools (MLT) to have optimized and valid output. The proposed method combines remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS and GIS) and MLT, which are appropriate for the predicament of neither small, large scale, nor long-term simulations. MLT methods such as VAR and ARIMA are developed in the Python programming with Jupyter notebook and tested according to the data in the spatial prediction for surface water quality parameters such as Tr, pH, Ec, TDS, AL, Ca++, NO3-, So, Cl, F-, Fe, and Mg2+ in the Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India-lower delta part. The delta with susceptible zones was identified using RS and GIS as those areas are prone to direct exposure to surface water contaminants from aquaculture, agricultural runoff, small- and medium-scale businesses, and household trash. Achieving effective surface water management for this ecosystem is critical for regional water management. The geographical information about the concentrations acquired via the RS and GIS was compared to the statistical modeling findings and verified using real-time measurements. MLT modeling seems more realistic than the experimental setting; data from the previous 20 years (2000-2020) were used for modeling, and the predicted values presented in the paper are predicted for the year 2021. The computed R-2 value of ranges between 0.75 and 0.96\% is recorded with ARIMA, and VAR posted range between 0.56 and 0.75\% with the trained and tested data. The findings show the potential for MLT of geographically dispersed hydrogeological data to be used for pollution-free surface water management. From the surface water management perspective, combining RS and GIS and MLT offers an alternate data analysis approach for obtaining quick results utilizing a less laborious process that produces acceptable results.",NA,"10.1007/s10668-023-03280-3",2024-09-27 22:46:38,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863709,"Peat Consumption And Carbon Loss Due To Smouldering Wildfire In A Temperate Peatland","Temperate peatlands represent a substantial store of carbon and their degradation is a potentially significant positive feedback to climate change. The ignition of peat deposits can cause smouldering wildfires that have the potential to release substantial amounts of carbon and to cause environmental damage from which ecosystem recovery can be slow. Direct estimates of the loss of carbon due to smouldering wildfires are needed to inform global estimates of the effect of wildfire on carbon dynamics and to aid with national emissions accounting. We surveyed the effect of a severe wildfire that burnt within an afforested peatland in the Scottish Highlands during the summer of 2006. The fire ignited layers of peat which continued to burn as a sub-surface smouldering wildfire for more than a month after the initial surface fire and despite several episodes of heavy rain. The smouldering fire perimeter enclosed an area of 4.1 ha. Analysis of weather records showed that the fire coincided with unusually warm, dry conditions and a period when the Canadian Fire Weather Index system predicted both generally high danger conditions (high Fire Weather Index) and low fuel moisture content in deep organic soil layers (high Drought Code values). Remaining peat layers in the burn area had comparatively low fuel moisture contents of ca. 250\% dry weight. Within the smouldering fire's perimeter, mean depth of burn was estimated at 17.5 +/- 2.0 cm but ranged from 1 to 54 cm. Based on field measurements, our estimates suggested that, in total, the smouldering wildfire burnt 773 +/- 120 t of organic matter corresponding to 396 +/- 63 t of carbon and a carbon loss per unit area burnt of 96 +/- 15 t ha(-1) (9.6 +/- 1.5 kg m(-2)). This corresponds to between 0.1\% and 0.3\% of the estimated total amount of carbon sequestered annually by UK peatlands. Our results also provide circumstantial evidence that afforestation of peatland soils, and associated site preparation, may contribute to an increased risk of peat fires. Smouldering fires are difficult to detect using remotely sensing techniques due to their low temperature and low heat release and the fact that the tree canopy remains intact for months afterwards. If similar smouldering fires are underreported in other temperate, boreal and tropical peatland regions then emissions from peatland burning may well be a substantially greater issue than currently assumed.

The object-oriented segmentation method was used to segment the cultivated land patches and obtain cultivated land management patches. The landscape pattern software Fragstats 4.2, SPSS statistical software, and the geographical detector model were used to analyze the spatial distribution of centralized contiguous management of cultivated land in the four towns of Yunzhou District as well as its main influencing factors. The results show that the four towns of Yunzhou District were primarily located in the hinterland of Datong Basin with flat terrain, and the aggregation index was >80. The overall distribution of cultivated land patches was relatively concentrated, and the cultivated land with concentrated contiguous status of Ⅲ and Ⅳ was larger than those of status Ⅰ and Ⅱ, accounting for 58.63%. In addition, the explanatory power of influencing factors on the centralized contiguous management of cultivated land in descending order was：the transfer rate of cultivated land, the proportion of daylily area, per capita income, the proportion of people with higher education, the proportion of agricultural farmers, the number of cooperatives, and the source of income; the differentiation determination index（q） values of these factors were >0.1. Moreover, the interaction effect exhibited both nonlinear and mutual enhancement, in which the interaction of the planting area of daylily with number of cooperatives was prominent, highlighting the essential role of the planting area of daylily in the centralized contiguous management of cultivated land. The effective transfer of cultivated land, the cultivation of daylily, and the establishment of cooperatives have promoted the centralized contiguous management of cultivated land. © 2023, Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

6863357,"Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Selective Logging In The State Of Mato Grosso Between 1992 And 2016","Selective logging is a forestry activity that includes harvesting a group of tree species in native forests, usually those of higher value or commercial interest. Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km(2) of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km(2). Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km(2).year(-1) and 268.18 km(2).year(-1) of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso. Finally, it was concluded that selective logging is annually disturbing a considerable extension of native forests in the state of Mato Grosso and, therefore, needs to be adequately considered and monitored by environmental agencies due to its potential forest impacts and to support the definition of public policies to ensure the future sustainability of forest production in that state.","{""Ferreira, Nilson Clementino"",""Miguel, Eder Pereira"",""Moretti, Mariana Soares"",""Pedlowski, Marcos Antonio"",""Trondoli Matricardi, Eraldo Aparecido"",""da Costa, Olivia Bueno""}","10.5902/1980509836802",2024-07-19 23:44:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Forest disturbances; Tropical forest; Amazon; Remote Sensing; Geographic Information System""}"
6863544,"Water Lead Exposure Risk In Flint, Michigan After Switchback In Water Source: Implications For Lead Service Line Replacement Policy","In February of 2016, the City of Flint, Michigan commenced the FAST start initiative with the aim “to get the lead out of Flint” by replacing lead and galvanized steel service lines throughout the city. An estimated 29,100 parcels are scheduled for service line replacement (SLR) at an expected cost of $172 million. The lead exposure benefits of SLR are evaluated by analyzing Sentinel data on hundreds of repeatedly sampled homes in Flint from February 16, 2016 to July 21, 2017, comparing water lead (WL) in homes with and without lead service lines. Samples taken from homes with lead service lines were significantly more likely to exceed specified thresholds of WL than homes without lead service lines. Second, regardless of service line material type, sampled homes experienced significant reductions in WL with elapsed time from Flint's switchback to water provided by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department. Third, the risk of exceedance of WL > 15 μg/L was uncorrelated with service line material type. These results are robust to sample restrictions, period stratification, time operations, reference group definitions, and statistical modeling procedures. On the question of what is gained from SLR over optimal corrosion control techniques, we simulated age-specific lead uptake (μg/day) and blood lead levels (μg/dL) for children in Flint at 16 and 90 weeks of elapsed time from Flint's switchback to Detroit water. At 90 weeks from the switchback in water source, the quantity of water lead consumed by children in homes with lead service lines decreased 93%, as compared to 16 weeks. Lead exposure benefits of SLR have declined in time, with modest differences in lead uptake across homes with different service lines. In light of results, policy considerations for Flint and nationwide are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","{""Keyes, C."",""McElmurry, S.

6863615,"Identifying The Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of Forest Ecotourism Values With Remotely Sensed Images And Social Media Data: A Perspective Of Public Preferences","Ecotourism, as a cultural ecosystem service, is an essential part of rural economic growth. Developing feasible methods and indicators for ecotourism values is vital to exploring the interactions between public preferences and ecosystems, thus providing information for sustainable ecosystem management. However, forest ecotourism value assessments at the regional scale still lack scientific frameworks covering the spatiotemporal dimension. Here, we proposed a framework to assess forest ecotourism values and explore the contributions of public preferences, selecting a typical and abundant forest area, Lin'an County, China. First, we applied a text mining approach on social comments to identify key variables related to public preferences. Then, we mapped these variables with remote sensing and GIS data and incorporated them with a Maxent model. This model revealed the spatiotemporal patterns of forest ecotourism value and its interaction with public preferences, over two periods, i.e., 2010-2014 and 2015-2019. Our results showed that albeit with a minor change magnitude in the entirety of ecotourism values (1-3\% overall decrease), about 34\% and 44\% of forests were observed as significant increases and decreases in ecotourism values, respectively. A large number of increases were concentrated in the village scenic areas, while decreases were observed in planted areas. Such notable changes were mainly attributable to changes in accessibility variables with 67\% of contributions in 2010-2014 and 72\% in 2015-2019. Variables related to human perception and vision (forest attribute and color diversity) also played a part. Our findings infer that local rural-building policies have an evident influence on the distribution and intensity of forest ecotourism. Our proposed framework provides references for evaluating the response and effectiveness of local policies and to make proactive efforts for forest protection, restoration and management.","{""Chen, Binjie"",""Deng, Jinsong"",""Gan, Muye"",""Lin, Yue"",""Wang, Ke"",""Xu, Zhihong"",""You, Shixue"",""Zheng, Qiming"",""Zhu, Congmou""}","10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130715",2024-07-17 16:56:46,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Recreation; Aesthetic; Cultural ecosystem service; Text mining; Maxent""}"
6863437,"Improved Deep Learning-Based Vehicle Detection For Urban Applications Using Remote Sensing Imagery","Remote sensing (RS) data can be attained from different sources, such as drones, satellites, aerial platforms, or street-level cameras. Each source has its own characteristics, including the spectral bands, spatial resolution, and temporal coverage, which may affect the performance of the vehicle detection algorithm. Vehicle detection for urban applications using remote sensing imagery (RSI) is a difficult but significant task with many real-time applications. Due to its potential in different sectors, including traffic management, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and defense, the detection of vehicles from RS data, such as aerial or satellite imagery, has received greater emphasis. Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), has proven to be effective in vehicle detection tasks. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely utilized to detect vehicles and automatically learn features from the input images. This study develops the Improved Deep Learning-Based Vehicle Detection for Urban Applications using Remote Sensing Imagery (IDLVD-UARSI) technique. The major aim of the IDLVD-UARSI method emphasizes the recognition and classification of vehicle targets on RSI using a hyperparameter-tuned DL model. To achieve this, the IDLVD-UARSI algorithm utilizes an improved RefineDet model for the vehicle detection and classification process. Once the vehicles are detected, the classification process takes place using the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) model. Finally, a Quantum-Based Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (QDMO) algorithm is applied to ensure an optimal hyperparameter tuning process, demonstrating the novelty of the work. The simulation results of the IDLVD-UARSI technique are obtained on a benchmark vehicle database. The simulation values indicate that the IDLVD-UARSI technique outperforms the other recent DL models, with maximum accuracy of 97.89\% and 98.69\% on the VEDAI and ISPRS Potsdam databases, respectively.","{""Abdushkour, Hesham A."",""Alshareef, Abdulrhman M."",""Alyoubi, Khaled H."",""Khadidos, Adil O."",""Khadidos, Alaa O."",""Ragab, Mahmoud""}","10.3390/rs15194747",2024-07-16 22:58:23,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2023,"{}","{""urban applications; remote sensing images; vehicle detection; object detector; deep learning""}"
6863581,"Quantification Of Groundwater Storage Variations And Stressed Areas Using Multi-Temporal Grace Data: A Case Study Of Upper Indus Plains, Pakistan","Groundwater is depleting at a more rapid rate than its replenishment in Indus Basin due to increased demand attributed to urbanization, inefficient water management practices especially in the agricultural sector and increase in impervious area in the name of development that can expose the country to severe challenge in the future. Through an unregulated groundwater exploitation now farmers often meet inadequacy in surface water supplies. The concurrent use of surface water and groundwater water now takes place on more than 70% of irrigated lands. Therefore, water resources should be monitored on frequent intervals to sensitize policy makers to formulate an optimal framework for water management practices. This study assessed the competence of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE)—based estimation of changes in Ground Water Storage (GWS) as a substitute approach for groundwater quantitative approximation for management of groundwater resources in the Indus basin. The GRACE satellite Total Water Storage (TWS) data from 2011 to 2015 was used to calculate GWS. A common reduction trend was seen in the Upper Indus Plain (UIP) where the average net loss of groundwater was observed to be 1701.39 km3 of water amid 2011-2015. A net loss of around 0.34 km3/year groundwater storage was deduced for the UIP where flooding in 2014 assumed a fundamental part in natural replenishment of groundwater aquifer of the UIP. In view of TWS varieties three out of four doabs Bari, Rachna, Thal demonstrated a decrease in groundwater capacity though Chaj doab brought about increment of 0.09 km3. Based on this study, GRACE-Tellus satellite data is competent enough to hint for groundwater storage variations, however there is a vibrant need to calibrate GRACE-Tellus data with hydrological stations data periodically in order to take a maximum advantage for utility of GRACE to monitor groundwater variations on regional scale. Future studies should focus on this aspect. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","{""Amin, M."",""Jamil, A."",""Khan, M.

6863225,"Spatial Prediction Of Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Distribution Using A Combination Of Remotely Sensed And Field-Observed Environmental Data","Context. In New Zealand, the introduced brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, is a reservoir of bovine tuberculosis and as such poses a major threat to the livestock industry. Aerial 1080 poisoning is an important tool for possum control but is expensive, creating an ongoing need for ever more cost-effective ways of using this technique. Aims. To develop geographic information system (GIS) models to better predict spatial variation in the distribution of unmanaged possum populations, to facilitate better targeting of control activities. Methods. Relative abundance of possums and their distribution among habitat types were surveyed in a dry high-country area of the northern South Island. Two GIS-based models were developed to predict the relative abundance of possums on trap lines. The first model used remotely sensed (digital) environmental data; the second complemented the remotely sensed data with fine-scale habitat and topographic data collected on the ground. Key results. Digital environmental factors and habitat features proved to be key predictors of relative possum abundance. In both GIS models, height above valley floor, presence of forest cover and mean annual temperature were the strongest predictors. Conclusions. Predictive maps (projections) of relative possum abundance produced from these models can provide useful decision-support tools for pest-control managers, by enabling possum control to be targeted spatially. Implications. Spatially targeted pest control could allow effective control activities for invasive species or disease vectors to be applied at a lower cost for the same benefit.","{""Byrom, Andrea E."",""McKenzie, Joanna"",""Nugent, Graham"",""Porphyre, Thibaud"",""Shepherd, James"",""Yockney, Ivor""}","10.1071/wr13028",2024-07-19 18:47:33,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{}","{""disease management; invasive species; predictive map; relative abundance; spatial modeling; spatiall""}"
6863714,"Information Content Of In Situ And Remotely Sensed Chlorophyll-A: Learning From Size-Structured Phytoplankton Model","Chlorophyll-a measurements in the form of in situ observations and satellite ocean colour products are commonly used in data assimilation to calibrate marine biogeochemical models. Here, a two size-class phytoplankton biogeochemical model, with a OD configuration, was used to simulate the surface chlorophyll-a dynamics (simulated surface Chl-a) for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies off East Australia. An optical model was then used to calculate the inherent optical properties from the simulation and convert them into remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). Subsequently, R-rs was used to produce a satellite-like estimate of the simulated surface Chl-a concentrations through the MODIS OC3M algorithm (simulated OC3M Chl-a). Identical parameter optimisation experiments were performed through the assimilation of the two separate datasets (simulated surface Chl-a and simulated OC3M Chl-a), with the purpose of investigating the contrasting information content of simulated surface Chl-a and remotely-sensed data sources. The results we present are based on the analysis of the distribution of a cost function, varying four parameters of the biogeochemical model. In our idealized experiments the simulated OC3M Chl-a product is a poor proxy for the total simulated surface Chl-a concentration. Furthermore, our result show the OC3M algorithm can underestimate the simulated chlorophyll-a concentration in offshore eddies off East Australia (Case I waters), because of the weak relationship between large-sized phytoplankton and remote-sensing reflectance. Although Case I waters are usually characteristic of oligotrophic environments, with a photosynthetic community typically represented by relatively small-sized phytoplankton, mesoscale features such as eddies can generate seasonally favourable conditions for a photosynthetic community with a greater proportion of large phytoplankton cells. Furthermore, our results show that in mesoscale features such as eddies, in situ chlorophyll-a observations and the ocean colour products can carry different information related to phytoplankton sizes. Assimilating both remote-sensing reflectance and measurements of in situ chlorophyll-a concentration reduces the uncertainty of the parameter values more than either data set alone, thus reducing the spread of acceptable solutions, giving an improved simulation of the natural environment.","{""Baird, Mark E."",""Doblin, Martina A."",""Laiolo, Leonardo"",""Matear, Richard"",""Soja-Wozniak, Monika""}","10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.03.005",2024-09-30 21:28:17,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Satellite oceanography; Remote sensing; Ocean colour; Data assimilation; Primary production; Biogeoc""}"
6863323,"Integrating Remote Sensing And Diver Observations To Predict The Distribution Of Invasive Lionfish On Bahamian Coral Reefs","The ongoing invasion of coral reefs in the greater Caribbean region by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) poses challenges for managers. Although the dynamics and ecological effects of lionfish invasions have been examined in detail at the scale of individual reefs, relatively little information is available on the patterns of the invasion over larger areas. This study combined species counts and microhabitat observations from SCUBA surveys with satellite-derived bathymetry and habitat data to create predictive species distribution maps of lionfish in a 58 km(2) region along the southern edge of the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Models predicted lionfish presence, absence, and density, and were created iteratively using various resolutions and types of data to mimic the datasets that may be available to management in the region. The best-fit model for presence and absence, which combined physical variables derived from remotely sensed satellite data and diver-collected microhabitat data, predicted 89\% of lionfish presence and absence. The best-fit model for lionfish density used 2 resolutions of physical habitat data as well as biological data on densities of large native groupers and accurately predicted 67\% lionfish density. These results suggest that physical habitat may be more important for initial lionfish presence and that biotic interactions influence lionfish density on the reefs. Understanding the limitations and value of each type of data when creating models may be advantageous for planning targeted lionfish removals and prioritizing sites for conservation efforts.","{""Davis, Alexandra C.

6862981,"A Call For Viewshed Ecology: Advancing Our Understanding Of The Ecology Of Information Through Viewshed Analysis","There has been rapid increase of interest in the role that information acquisition plays in ecological process and in shaping life histories and their evolution. Compared to auditory and olfactory cues, the range at which visual cues are likely to be informative to animals is particularly sensitive to the spatial structure of the environment. However, quantification of and accounting for availability of visual information in fundamental and applied ecological research remains extremely limited. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of animal behaviour in a spatial context would greatly benefit from objective quantification of the area an animal can potentially obtain visual information from and therefore draw broad attention to viewshed analysis. This analysis identifies all cells of a gridded surface that are connected by lines-of-sight to a viewpoint, hence, providing information on how much of the environment surrounding a location can be seen. Although heavily used in non-ecological disciplines including civil planning and archaeology, viewshed analysis has seldom been applied in an ecological context. Here, we highlight the opportunity to make use of viewshed approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional remote sensing data and data from animal tracking to make major progress in understanding how visual information influences animal spatial behaviour, ecology and evolution.","{""Aben, Job"",""Pellikka, Petri"",""Travis, Justin M.

6863645,"Spatial And Temporal Evolution Of Carbon Stocks In Dongting Lake Wetlands Based On Remote Sensing Data","Wetlands are one of the important carbon reservoirs on earth, assessing the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetland carbon stocks and their driving mechanisms is critical for stabilizing and enhancing the carbon sink function of wetlands. In this study, the carbon stocks of Dongting Lake wetland during 1995-2020 were estimated using the Integrate Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Tool (InVEST) model and land use/cover data derived from remote sensing data. Subsequently, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was utilized to explore the driving mechanisms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks based on natural and socio-economic factors. Finally, evolution of land use status and carbon stocks was simulated based on patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model during 2030-2050 under different scenarios. The results showed that: 1) over the past 25 years, carbon stocks have been fluctuating in a 'decrease-increase-decrease' pattern, with an average decrease of 39.70 x 10(6) t per year; 2) compared with socio-economic factors, climate conditions have a greater influence on the change of carbon stocks distribution; 3) under the natural variation scenario, the carbon stocks in 2030 is 1345.36 x 10(6) t, which is increased compared with the year of 2020. However, the carbon stocks in 2040-2050 started to show a decreasing trend. Under the ecological conservation scenario, the increase in forest area leads to a significant increase in carbon stocks from 2030 to 2050, which showed a continuous growth trend and obviously enhanced the carbon sequestration capacity of the Ecological and Economic Circle around Dongting Lake. The results of this study are expected to provide a scientific basis for carbon balance, land use restructuring and wetland resource management planning in the ecological and economic circle around Dongting Lake.","{""An, Xuexian"",""Chen, Shudan"",""Jin, Wenping"",""Long, Xiangren"",""Qi, Shuaiyang"",""Zhang, Meng""}","10.1080/10106049.2022.2093412",2024-07-19 18:48:03,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Wetland; carbon stocks; InVEST; driving mechanisms; simulation""}"
6903637,"Multi-Scale Model Analysis Of Boundary Layer Ozone Over East Asia","This study employs the regional Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to examine seasonal and diurnal variations of boundary layer ozone (O-3) over East Asia. We evaluate the response of model simulations of boundary layer O-3 to the choice of chemical mechanisms, meteorological fields, boundary conditions, and model resolutions. Data obtained from surface stations, aircraft measurements, and satellites are used to advance understanding of O-3 chemistry and mechanisms over East Asia and evaluate how well the model represents the observed features. Satellite measurements and model simulations of summertime rainfall are used to assess the impact of the Asian monsoon on O-3 production. Our results suggest that summertime O-3 over Central Eastern China is highly sensitive to cloud cover and monsoonal rainfall over this region. Thus, accurate simulation of the East Asia summer monsoon is critical to model analysis of atmospheric chemistry over China. Examination of hourly summertime O-3 mixing ratios from sites in Japan confirms the important role of diurnal boundary layer fluctuations in controlling ground-level O-3. By comparing five different model configurations with observations at six sites, the specific mechanisms responsible for model behavior are identified and discussed. In particular, vertical mixing, urban chemistry, and dry deposition depending on boundary layer height strongly affect model ability to capture observed behavior. Central Eastern China appears to be the most sensitive region in our study to the choice of chemical mechanisms. Evaluation with TRACE-P aircraft measurements reveals that neither the CB4 nor the SAPRC99 mechanisms consistently capture observed behavior of key photochemical oxidants in springtime. However, our analysis finds that SAPRC99 performs somewhat better in simulating mixing ratios of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) at flight altitudes below 1 km. The high level of uncertainty associated with O-3 production in Central Eastern China poses a major problem for regional air quality management. This highly polluted, densely populated region would greatly benefit from comprehensive air quality monitoring and the development of model chemical mechanisms appropriate to this unique atmospheric environment.",NA,"10.5194/acp-9-3277-2009",2024-09-27 22:47:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863228,"Gesanet: Geospatial-Awareness Network For Vhr Remote Sensing Image Change Detection","The characteristics of very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images (RSIs) have higher spatial resolution inherently and are easier to obtain globally compared with hyperspectral images (HSIs), making it possible to detect small-scale land cover changes in multiple applications. RSI change detection (RSI-CD) based on deep learning has been paid attention to become a frontier research field in recent years and is currently facing two challenging problems. The first is high dependence on registration between bitemporal images caused by high spatial resolution. The other is high pseudo-change information response caused by low spectral resolution. In order to address the abovementioned two problems, a novel RSI-CD framework called geospatial-awareness network (GeSANet) based on the geospatial position matching mechanism (PMM) with multilevel adjustment and the geospatial content reasoning mechanism (CRM) with diverse pseudo-change information filtering is proposed. First, the PMM assigns independent 2-D offset coordinates to each position in the previous temporal image. Afterward, bilinear interpolation is employed to obtain the subpixel feature value after the offset, and the sparse results based on the difference are transmitted to the next level prediction to realize multilevel geospatial correction. The CRM extracts the global features from the corrected sparse feature map in terms of dimensions, implementing effective discriminant feature extraction on the basis of the original feature map in a stepwise refinement manner through the cross-dimension exchange mechanism, to filter out various pseudo-change information as well as maintain real change information. Comparison experiments with five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are carried out on two popular datasets with diverse changes, and the results show that the proposed method has good robustness and validity for multitemporal RSI-CD. In particular, it has a strong comparative advantage in detecting small entity changes and edge details.

6903513,"Tempo-Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment From The Perspective Of Human Engineering Activity","The expansion of mountainous urban areas and road networks can influence the terrain, vegetation, and material characteristics, thereby altering the susceptibility of landslides. Understanding the relationship between human engineering activities and landslide occurrence is of great significance for both landslide prevention and land resource management. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the landslide caused by Typhoon Megi in 2016. A representative mountainous area along the eastern coast of China-characterized by urban development, deforestation, and severe road expansion-was used to analyze the spatial distribution of landslides. For this purpose, high-precision Planet optical remote sensing images were used to obtain the landslide inventory related to the Typhoon Megi event. The main innovative features are as follows: (i) the newly developed patch generating land-use simulation (PLUS) model simulated and analyzed the driving factors of land-use land-cover (LULC) from 2010 to 2060; (ii) the innovative stacking strategy combined three strong ensemble models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-to calculate the distribution of landslide susceptibility; and (iii) distance from road and LULC maps were used as short-term and long-term dynamic factors to examine the impact of human engineering activities on landslide susceptibility. The results show that the maximum expansion area of built-up land from 2010 to 2020 was 13.433 km(2), mainly expanding forest land and cropland land, with areas of 8.28 km(2 )and 5.99 km(2), respectively. The predicted LULC map for 2060 shows a growth of 45.88 km(2) in the built-up land, mainly distributed around government residences in areas with relatively flat terrain and frequent socio-economic activities. The factor contribution shows that distance from road has a higher impact than LULC. The Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM model obtained the optimal AUC value of 0.915 in the landslide susceptibility analysis in 2016. Furthermore, future road network and urban expansion have intensified the probability of landslides occurring in urban areas in 2015. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the PLUS and Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM models in landslide susceptibility analysis in international literature. The research results can serve as a foundation for developing land management guidelines to reduce the risk of landslide failures.",NA,"10.3390/rs15164111",2024-10-01 17:52:03,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6447812,"Seasonal synchrony: the key to tick-borne encephalitis foci identified by satellite data","A previous analysis of tick infestation patterns on rodents in Slovakia suggested that the key to the focal distribution of western-type tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEv) in Europe is the geographically variable degree of synchrony in the seasonal activity of larval and nymphal Ixodes ricinus ticks. This prediction is here tested by examining records, from 7 different countries, of the seasonal variation in the abundance of larvae and nymphs feeding on rodents or questing on the vegetation. Larvae consistently started feeding and questing earlier in the year at sites within TBEv foci than elsewhere, so that they appeared in the spring as soon as nymphs were active. Such larval–nymphal synchrony is associated with a rapid fall in ground-level temperatures from August to October as revealed by the satellite-derived index of Land Surface Temperature (LST). Likewise, of 1992 pixels sampled on a grid across Europe, the 418 that fell within TBEv foci were characterized by a higher than average rate of autumnal cooling relative to the peak midsummer LST. It is proposed that such a seasonal temperature profile may cause unfed larvae to pass the winter in quiescence, from which they emerge synchronously with nymphs in the spring.","{""Green, R.

6863066,"4d-Var Inversion Of European Nh3 Emissions Using Cris Nh3 Measurements And Geos-Chem Adjoint With Bi-Directional And Uni-Directional Flux Schemes","We conduct the first 4D-Var inversion of NH3 accounting for NH3 bi-directional flux, using CrIS satellite NH3 observations over Europe in 2016. We find posterior NH3 emissions peak more in springtime than prior emissions at continental to national scales, and annually they are generally smaller than the prior emissions over central Europe, but larger over most of the rest of Europe. Annual posterior anthropogenic NH3 emissions for 25 European Union members (EU25) are 25\% higher than the prior emissions and very close (<2\% difference) to other inventories. Our posterior annual anthropogenic emissions for EU25, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are generally 10\%-20\% smaller than when treating NH3 fluxes as uni-directional emissions, while the monthly regional difference can be up to 34\% (Switzerland in July). Compared to monthly mean in-situ observations, our posterior NH3 emissions from both schemes generally improve the magnitude and seasonality of simulated surface NH3 and bulk NHx wet deposition throughout most of Europe, whereas evaluation against hourly measurements at a background site shows the bi-directional scheme better captures observed diurnal variability of surface NH3. This contrast highlights the need for accurately simulating diurnal variability of NH3 in assimilation of sun-synchronous observations and also the potential value of future geostationary satellite observations. Overall, our top-down ammonia emissions can help to examine the effectiveness of air pollution control policies to facilitate future air pollution management, as well as helping us understand the uncertainty in top-down NH3 emissions estimates associated with treatment of NH3 surface exchange. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric ammonia contributes to air pollutants and excessive deposition of reactive nitrogen that is detrimental to sensitive ecosystems. Ammonia is emitted mainly by agricultural livestock and fertilizer use. While surface measurements of NH3 are sparse, satellite observations can provide near daily global coverage. Here we calculate monthly NH3 emissions over Europe, the only region adopting NH3 control policies, using an air quality model coupled with a process-based bi-directional NH3 flux scheme and NH3 measurements observed by the CrIS satellite instrument. Our CrIS-derived annual regional total anthropogenic NH3 emissions are close (<2\% difference) to statistic-based bottom-up estimates and are 10\%-20\% lower than when treating NH3 exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere as one-way emissions. Our top-down NH3 emissions estimates may help to assess the efficacy of NH3 abatement policies and provide quantitative support for future policy making.","{""Bash, Jesse O."",""Braban, Christine"",""Bruemmer, Christian"",""Cady-Pereira, Karen"",""Cao, Hansen"",""Capps, Shannon L."",""Dammers, Enrico"",""Ellermann, Thomas"",""Fauvel, Yannick"",""Feigenspan, Stefan"",""Flechard, Christophe"",""Geels, Camilla"",""Heath, Nicholas"",""Henze, Daven K."",""Kruit, Roy Wichink"",""Leeson, Sarah"",""Lonsdale, Chantelle"",""Meier, Mario"",""Miyazaki, Kazuyuki"",""Sanocka, Agnieszka"",""Schrader, Frederik"",""Seitler, Eva"",""Shephard, Mark W."",""Sitwell, Michael"",""Stephens, Amy C.

The above changes contributed to an increased awareness about the deep impact\nthat policy decisions have at the local and the global level. Therefore, there is a strong need that policy-making\nand decision-making processes for a sustainable development be based on the best available knowledge about\nEarth system and environment.\nThe recent advance of information technologies enables running complex models that use the large amount of\nEarth Observation datasets available. However, data and model interoperability are still limited to the syntactic\nlevel allowing to access and process datasets independently of their structural characteristics (data format, co-\nordinate reference systems, service interface, ...) but with no clear reference to their content (the semantic level)\nand context of use (the pragmatic level).

This paper develops an overall framework for assessment of the economic value of meteorological services based on the recognition that most national meteorological infrastructure and services possess the non-rival properties of public goods. Given this overall framework for determination of both total and marginal benefits, four main methodologies appropriate for use in valuation studies – market prices, normative or prescriptive decision-making models, descriptive behavioural response studies and contingent valuation studies – are outlined and their strengths and limitations described. Notwithstanding the methodological limitations and the need for a much more comprehensive set of studies for the various application sectors, it is clear that the actual and potential benefits to individuals, firms, industry sectors and national economies from stateof-the-art meteorological and related services are substantial and that, at this stage, they are inadequately recognised and insufficiently exploited in many countries.","{""Freebairn, John""}","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1350482702001044",2024-04-25 02:42:23,"excluded","{""Value is not measured""}",2002,"{interesting}",NA
6691603,"The benefits and challenges of having an open and free basis satellite data sharing platform in Turkey: Gezgin","Turkey is a county that experiences rapid socioeconomic development, which, in turn, leads to high urbanization rates due to migration of people from rural to urban areas, many large-scale development projects (e.g. highways, dams, housing and infrastructure), and environmental problems that adversely affect agriculture, such as soil erosion and deforestation. Furthermore, Turkey lies in a region prone to natural disasters, especially earthquakes, landslides, flooding and forest fires. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires continuous monitoring to enable rapid response as well as the development of effective socioeconomic policies. In this regard, space-based earth observation (EO) systems play a critical role in the rapid acquisiton and extraction of crucial information. The first launch of the first Turkish-designed satellite, RASAT, in 2011 led to the wide-spread exploitation of space-based resources by Turkish institutions through the dissemination of EO data on an open and free basis via the GEZGIN internet portal (http://www.gezgin.gov.tr). The push for data sharing was further instigated by the nationally funded project GEOPORTAL (Satellite Image Processing and Geoportal Development Project) and European Union FP7 project EOPOWER (Earth Observation for Economic Empowerment), which strove to create conditions for sustainable economic development through the increased use of Earth observation products and services for environmental applications.

Methods: We used electronic health records (2007–2016) from an urban, pediatric integrated delivery system and linked children (N = 51,873, ages 6–19 years, 77% African American) to neighborhood-level data to investigate how changes in neighborhood environments relate to changes in body mass index (BMI). Measures of neighborhood environment were resources for healthy foods and physical activity (‘resources’), greenness, violent crime rate, perceived safety and social cohesion. Fixed effects models estimated associations between changes in neighborhood environment exposures and changes in BMI z-score and whether effects differed by sex, baseline age, neighborhood socioeconomic status and population density. Results: Approximately 22% of the cohort was obese (BMI z-score ≥ 95th percentile). In adjusted models, increases in neighborhood greenness and perceived safety were associated with decreases in BMI z-score (mean change in BMI z-score for 1-SD increase for both: -0.012; 95% CI= (−0.018, −0.007)). Increases in neighborhood safety had a stronger effect in children ages 6–10 years than in older children. Increases in social cohesion were associated with increases in BMI z-score (mean change: 0.005 95% CI = (0.003, 0.008)) especially in boys. Increases in food and physical activity resources were not associated with changes in BMI. Conclusions: This study suggests that increasing neighborhood greenness and safety are potential approaches to reduce children's BMI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","{""Auchincloss, A.

Observation of its spatiotemporal distribution is necessary for water and disaster mitigation management. This study evaluated the performance of two high-resolution satellite precipitation datasets-the GSMaP and GPM-IMERG-in estimating accumulated TC rainfall in the Philippines from 2000 to 2021. TC rain is defined as rainfall within 5 degrees of a TC center. Several estimation algorithms were included in the assessment. The uncalibrated near-real-time GSMaP\_NRT and early version GPM\_ER, the reanalysis GSMaP\_RNL, and the gauge-calibrated GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G. The assessment shows the worst scores for the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT and GSMaP\_RNL, followed by GPM\_ER with station correlation coefficient (CC) values of 0.63, 0.67, and 0.73, respectively, compared to GSMaP\_G CC of 0.79 and GPM\_G CC of 0.77. GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G also gave the least bias and error, with a consistently high (>0.6) probability of detection (POD) and Pierce skill score (PSS) up to rainfall of 300 mm. In addition to the evaluation, the GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G were used in the analog forecasting of TC rain. Analog forecasting is based on the principle that past weather conditions can occur again. In TC rain analog forecasting, past TCs with similar intensities and tracks are assumed to bring similar rainfall amounts and distribution as a current TC. Composite mean TC rainfall from historical satellite precipitation estimations was produced to create TC rain forecasts. Results show the analog TC rain forecasts generally captured the spatial distribution of TC rain and performed better than the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT, with a mean station correlation of 0.62-0.67, POD greater than 0.7, and positive PSS indicating good skills. However, forecasts have a false alarm ratio greater than 0.8 for 150 mm rain and have difficulty producing extreme rainfall (>250 mm).",NA,"10.3390/atmos13091398",2024-10-01 17:50:26,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA

The first step is to formulate scheme set according to water resources in research area. The second step is to calculate the target ET of different sub item using the method such as the distributed hydrologic model, remote sensing estimation model, and the water use quota method. The third step is to evaluate each scheme based on the principle of sustainability, fairness and effectiveness, and to find the best scheme. Ordos is taken as the case study and five schemes were calculated in this paper. Scheme 1 is present situation of water resources utilization, and the target ET is 468.79 mm. Scheme 2 is increasing diverting water from the Yellow River, and the target ET is 450.89 mm. Scheme 3 is decreasing the ground water, and the target ET is 432.95 mm. Scheme 4 is to reduce diverting water from the Yellow River, and the target ET is 406.11 mm. Scheme 5 is a saving water plan, the target ET is 383.27 mm. Then, the scheme 5 is the optimal solutions and recommendations according to comprehensive evaluation. The comparison between Scheme 1 and 5 showed that, with the development of population, economy and society, target ET reduced gradually with the high water-saving measures. The proportion of target ET in cultivated land declined, because water consumption of cultivated land reduced. The proportion of residential and industrial land target ET increased due to the economic development. The second and third industry water demand and ecological water use will increase at the same time. In order to guarantee reliability and accuracy of the area target ET, calculation results of distributed hydrological model and the remote sensing estimation method verified the validity. Two methods calculation error of the area actual ET value is 0.78% and 1.22%, respectively.

6863689,"New Opportunities For Low-Cost Lidar-Derived Snow Depth Estimates From A Consumer Drone-Mounted Smartphone","Snow has significant impacts on springtime flooding, water resource management practices and the regional water-energy budget. In situ observations are considered some of the highest quality measurements of snow depth available, and are useful constraints for numerical weather prediction models and reanalysis system estimates of snow water equivalent. The application of laser altimetry (LiDAR-Light Detection and Ranging) for measuring snow depth has proven an effective method for quickly observing large areas, however this technique is expensive to perform due to the high cost of the necessary equipment coupled with required operator training. In this work, we examine the capabilities of the iPhone 12 Pro LiDAR (iLiDAR) when attached to a consumer-grade DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter in estimating snow depth at three study sites in southern Ontario, Canada. Initial comparisons between drone iLiDAR depth estimates and collocated snow ruler measurements demonstrate good agreement, with a root-mean-square error of 3 cm and absolute mean error of 2.5 cm. The intersection of these two technologies defines a novel, low-cost alternative to traditional LiDAR-based snow depth measurement systems, while maintaining a high level of observational accuracy and precision. © 2023 The Authors","{""Fletcher, C.

6691762,"Value and validity of Earth resources observations from space","Observations of the earth from space can provide overall repetitive views in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Data from such surveys can be used as the basis for more detailed observations from aircraft and on the ground to guide resource exploration, development, and conservation activities. The value of earth resource observations from space has been demonstrated by the practical use ofphotographs from the Gemini and Apollo spaceflights and particularly by a series of multispectral photographs taken during the flight of Apollo 9. The analysis of those photographs has shown that the performance of the planned Earth Resources Technology Satellite will meet the needs of the resource and environmental community for small-scale repetitive images of the earth in the visible and solar infrared portions of the spectrum and has provided a limited base of material for earth scientists to work with in order to ready themselves for the ERTS data. The validity of earth resource observations from space can be derived by analogy from the successively closer observations of the moon, culminating in repeated physical sampling of the moon's surface. The method of inductive reasoning and analysis used for the moon is the opposite of the normal deductive analysis used on the earth. Adoption of the inductive methods and reasoning for earth observations will provide a framework of broad observations and conclusions leading to the identification of target areas for more detailed observation and will, in time, reduce the costs and time required for surveys dealing with resource and environmental problems.","{""Robinove, Charles""}","https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667309494008",2024-04-26 18:55:07,"excluded","{""Value is not measured"",""Data is not valued""}",1973,"{}",NA
6863503,"Control Charts For Improved Decisions In Environmental Management: A Case Study Of Catchment Water Supply In South-West Western Australia","Environmental monitoring is becoming increasingly sophisticated with the widespread adoption of data loggers, sensor arrays and remote sensing, leading to larger scale, higher resolution and superior quality data. However, interpreting monitoring data and deciding when and how to apply environmental management remains a subjective and underdeveloped area of research. Control charts, developed in industrial settings to identify when manufacturing processes were beyond the acceptable bounds of production quality, represent one solution. Despite their potential utility, control charts have rarely been adopted in environmental monitoring. In theory, they are able to identify undesirable trends early and provide transparent and broadly consensual criteria for defining when management action should take place, that is action is triggered when parameter values are observed beyond the agreed control limits of the process. Once triggered, a predetermined management action is implemented. Possible actions are many and varied, and range from investigation and increased monitoring to intervention in the system. Here, the utility of control charts in monitoring water supply in south-western Australia from 1911 to 2010 is examined, and their ability to provide an early, transparent and easily understandable means of triggering management action is assessed. Two control chart types are applied: the X-bar chart and the CUSUM chart. X-bar charts varied widely in their ability to trigger action and were insensitive to many traditional threshold criteria (of which there are many to choose from). In contrast, standard CUSUM charts are specifically designed to detect subtler shifts away from a mean trend and hence provided a more consistent warning of the decline in water supply. While managers were aware of the decline in water supply from an early stage, we believe that control charts could have clearly communicated this earlier, enabling consensus among decision makers to be reached more rapidly. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.","{""Archibald, R."",""Garkaklis, M."",""Gove, A.

6863012,"Mapping Prospects For Artificial Groundwater Recharge Utilizing Remote Sensing And Gis Methods","The indiscriminate use of groundwater and its overexploitation has led to a significant decline in groundwater resources in India, making it essential to identify potential recharge zones for aquifer recharge. A study was conducted to determine such potential recharge zones in the Nandhour-Kailash River watershed. The study area included 1481 streams divided into 12 sub-basins (SWS). The results show that the downstream Saraunj sub-basins (SWS-11) and Odra sub-basins (SWS-12) were high priority and required immediate soil and water conservation attention. Sub catchments Lobchla West (SWS-4), Deotar (SWS-5), Balot South (SWS-8), Nandhour (SWS-9), and Nakoliy (SWS-10) had medium priority and were designated for moderate soil erosion and degradation. In contrast, sub-catchments Aligad (SWS-1), Kundal (SWS-2), Lowarnala North (SWS-3), Bhalseni (SWS-6), and Uparla Gauniyarao (SWS-7) had low priority, indicating a low risk of soil erosion and degradation. Using the existing groundwater level data, the potential map of groundwater was validated to confirm its validity. According to the guidelines provided by the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD), the results of the groundwater potential zones for good to very good zones have been integrated at the slope and stream order. In a 120.94 km2 area with a slope of 0-5\% in first-order streams, 36 ponds were proposed, and in a 218.03 km2 area with a slope of 15\% in first- to fourth-order streams, 105 retention dams were proposed and recognized as possible sites for artificial groundwater recharge. The proposed water harvesting structure may aid in continuously recharging these zones and benefit water resource managers and planners. Thus, various governmental organizations can use the results to identify possible future recharge areas.","{""Abed, Salwan Ali"",""Al-Ansari, Nadhir"",""Gururani, Dheeraj Mohan"",""Kumar, Vinod"",""Kumar, Yogendra"",""Kuriqi, Alban"",""Mattar, Mohamed A."",""Singh, Kanwarpreet"",""Vishwakarma, Dinesh Kumar""}","10.3390/w15223904",2024-07-18 21:47:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""artificial groundwater potential zone; compound priority value; GIS; remote sensing; thematic layers""}"
6863239,"Baseline Health Indicators Of Eastern Pacific Green Turtles (Chelonia Mydas) From Baja California Sur, Mexico","Sea turtle health is an important component of conservation since these taxa is susceptible to infectious diseases that can cause illness leading to mortality. Threats to the health, survival, and reproduction of sea turtles are increasingly documented; however, prevention and control has not yet been successfully achieved. Thus, information about health indicators of sea turtles is a useful tool in order to achieve the best possible conservation measures. The objective of this study was to establish a baseline of health indicators of free-ranging Eastern Pacific green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from neritic foraging and juvenile developmental habitats in Baja California Sur. Here, we contribute baseline and reference interval values of vital signs, complete blood count, and plasma blood chemistry for live specimens from coastal lagoons: Ojo de liebre and San Ignacio in Baja California Sur, Mexico. With the integration of these indicators, 79 turtles were diagnosed as “healthy.” Development of site-specific baseline of health indicators for free-ranging sea turtle populations allows to infer that the habitat provides adequate conditions for these species to carry out the activities corresponding to their stage of development and helps to create the management plans and pertinent conservation strategies as well as for the organisms in the area. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","{""Fernández-Sanz, H."",""Lara-Uc, M.

6862805,"A Comparative Study Of Urban Expansion In Beijing, Tianjin And Shijiazhuang Over The Past Three Decades","Detailed comparative studies on spatiotemporal patterns of both urbanized area and urban expansion over a relatively long timeframe are rare. Here, we compared spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in three major cities (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang) in the Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration using multi-temporal Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ images data of circa 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and landscape analysis approaches. A multi-scale analysis on the landscape responses to urban expansion from regional landscape to city and within city levels was performed. Results showed that urban area in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang has expanded from 801 km(2), 795 km(2) and 682 km(2) to 2452 km(2), 3343 km(2) and 1699 km(2), increasing annually at 3.7\%, 4.7\% and 3.2\%, respectively. Spatially, Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang have presented a mononuclear concentric polygon pattern, a double-nucleated polygon-line pattern, a sectorial point pattern, respectively, resulting primarily from their respective topographic constraints as well as urban planning and policy. Landscape responses to urban expansion varied with time and scale investigated, suggesting a general understanding on landscape metrics at regional or city level may fail to reveal detailed within city landscape dynamics under the impacts of urban expansion. The Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration faces a great challenge to manage trades-offs between narrowing down intra-regional disparity and maintaining regional economic and ecological benefits.

6862749,"Extracting Soil Moisture From Fengyun Satellite Images Using A Convolutional Neural Network","Objective: Obtaining soil moisture data with high temporal and spatial resolution is important for agricultural management and scientific research. The goal of this study is to use the Fengyun meteorological satellite as the data source, and utilize the advantage of convolutional neural network (CNN) that can independently learn the deep correlation between input variables to obtain high-quality soil moisture data. Fengyun 3 meteorological satellite is China's second-generation meteorological satellite. The goal of Fengyun 3 is to acquire all-weather, multi-spectral and 3D observations of global atmospheric and geophysical elements, providing satellite observation data to medium-term numerical weather prediction; monitoring ecological environment and large-scale natural disasters; providing satellite meteorological information for global environmental change, global climate change research, and others. The medium-resolution spectral imager II (MERSI-II) is one of the main loads of Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) and is equipped with 25 channels, including 16 visible-near-infrared channels, 3 short-wave infrared channels, and 6 medium-long infrared channels. Among the 25 channels, 6 channels with 250 m ground resolution and 19 channels with 1 000 m ground resolution are obtained. The research used FY-3D to obtain high-precision soil moisture data and constructed a soil moisture monitoring technology system that can greatly reduce the dependence on foreign data, operating cost of large-scale monitoring systems, and improve system stability, safety, and monitoring timeliness. Improving the ability of meteorological services and level of domestic satellite applications is important. To obtain high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture data using Fengyun satellite imagery, this study proposes a method of extracting soil moisture data using convolutional neural network(CNN). Method: CNN is a new machine learning technology that was newly developed in recent years and has attracted research attention because of its powerful autonomous learning ability. This technology has achieved great success in image classification, image segmentation, and other fields. This study constructed a soil moisture convolutional neural network (SMCNN) to achieve the goal of obtaining large-scale high-precision soil moisture monitoring using FY-3D remote sensing image. The SMCNN model includes seven parts, namely, input, temperature subnetwork, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extraction module, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extraction module, surface albedo extraction module, soil moisture subnetwork, and output. The temperature and soil moisture subnetworks contain a feature extractor and an encoder. The feature extractor is used to generate a feature vector for each pixel, where the feature extractor of the temperature subnetwork has 11 convolutional layers, and the feature extractor of the humidity subnetwork consists of 9 convolutional layers, and the convolutional layer uses a 1×1 type convolution kernel. The encoder is used to fit the extracted features to the target variable. Both subnetworks use the average variance as a loss function. In the model training stage, the preprocessed FY-3D image and corresponding observation point data are used as inputs, and in the model test phase, only the preprocessed FY-3D image is used as the input. The temperature subnetwork is used to obtain the ground temperature from the FY-3D image, the NDVI extraction module is used to extract the NDVI from the FY-3D image, the EVI extraction module is used to extract the EVI from the FY-3D image, and the surface albedo extraction module is used to obtain surface albedo. The extraction results of the aforementioned four parts are used as input to the soil moisture subnetwork. The soil moisture subnetwork uses the extracted ground temperature, NDVI, EVI, and ground albedo to retrieve soil moisture. The output of the model is the pixel-by-pixel soil moisture value. The model is trained using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and finally the tr ined model is used to extract regional soil moisture data. Result: Ningxia was selected as the experimental area. The FY-3D used in this study is all from the satellite ground receiving station of Ningxia Meteorological Bureau, including 161 images in 2018 and 92 images in 2019, with a total of 253. After the images were stitched together, a total of 92 images covering the entire territory of Ningxia were formed. The ground observation data used in this study came from the automatic weather station deployed by the Ningxia Meteorological Bureau. The time range was from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019. A total of 36 ground temperature stations and 37 soil moisture stations were observed. To verify the validity and rationality of this proposed method, we selected the linear regression and back propagation(BP) neural network models as the contrast models to conduct the data experiment. The mean square error was selected as the evaluation index. The comparison experimental results show that the RMSE of the SMCNN model is 0.006 7, which is higher than the comparison model. The experimental results show that the SMCNN model has advantages in extracting soil moisture from wind cloud images. Conclusion: The SMCNN model proposed in this paper fully utilizes deep learning technology to learn independently and improves the accuracy of obtaining soil moisture. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) Based on the analysis of the characteristics of FY-3D data, a step-by-step inversion strategy is established for the inversion of soil moisture requirements, and each step inversion uses a more relevant variable. The proposed strategy is an important reference for inverting other variables. 2) CNNs are used to construct network structures for inversion of surface temperature and soil moisture, and organized into a complete soil moisture inversion network structure. This structure enables direct access to soil moisture data from FY-3D data. 3) The feature value extracted by the 1×1 type convolution kernel used can be regarded as a spectral index and has a physical meaning. The main disadvantage of this study is that in the late stage of crop growth, the effect of vegetation index becomes invalid due to the saturation problem, which influences the inversion effect. This study aims to find other suitable supplementary parameters to introduce into the model to solve the effect of vegetation index saturation. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

6862932,"Stereo Mapping Of Ming Great Wall With Remote Sensing","Listed by UNESCO in 1987 as a World Heritage site, the world-famous Ming Great Wall stretches several thousands of kilometers across northern China, and served as a massive military defensive system which in recent times has a unique historical, artistic and scientific value. Due to historical reasons and lack of advanced technologies, construction resources and conservation status of Ming Great Wall have not been investigated in any systematic manner; indeed, the extent of the Great Wall has not even been measured. This has resulted in a shortage of reliable first-hand scientific information on actual size, spatially resource distribution and preservation status of this World Heritage site. Driven by the urgent need to establish protection, research, renovation and management of Ming Great Wall, a comprehensive investigation and spatial mapping was jointly organized and completed by the State Bureau of Survey and Mapping and State Administration of Culture Heritage. High resolution digital stereo models at 1:10000 map scale covering the whole length of the Ming Great Wall have been created by photogrammetric reconstruction using nearly ten thousand aerial images. Spatial distribution and attributes of the wall sections, trenches and various subsidiary facilities in the surroundings of the Great Wall were measured with the help of digital photogrammetry workstations and results from field studies. Reliable and precise information about the Ming Great Wall has now been obtained and documented, including surface lengths, resource distribution, and preservation status. For example, the total length of Ming Great Wall is 8851.8 km, of which 6259.6 km is of actual wall, 2232.5 km of natural terrain, and 359.7 km of trenches. In category lengths, 1828.8 km is constructed of stone, 3411.3 km of earth, 249.6 km in brick, 197.5 km of cliff wall and the rest 572.4 km of other means. Such information provides the scientific basis and strong platform in helping to delineate areas needing protection, in planning conservation and renovation programs, as well as digital archiving for posterity and web-based applications for modern promotions of one of the world's great attractions, the Ming Great Wall.","{""Chen Jun"",""Jin ShuPing"",""Liao AnPing"",""Rong DaWei"",""Yang ZhaoJun"",""Zhang HongWei"",""Zhao YouSong""}","10.1007/s11434-010-4295-9",2024-07-17 21:38:09,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2010,"{}","{""Ming Great Wall; aerial image; digital stereo model; surface length; stereo mapping""}"
6862838,"Potential Drivers Of Common Brusntail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Decline On A Murray River Floodplain","Australia's terrestrial mammalian fauna have experienced severe declines since European settlement. On the Murray-Darling floodplain in south-eastern Australia, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, 'possums'), have contracted to riparian zones. Although an important possum refuge, little is known about possum population dynamics here. We examined possum population dynamics and potential drivers across two decades on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station. We related possum density to satellite derived fractional cover, (a measure of the proportion of green, non-green and bare ground cover), and contextualised these findings using tree condition and grazing pressure datasets. Possum surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2019 in riparian and non-riparian habitats and density was modelled in relation to fractional cover values of green, non-green, and bare ground. Possum density fluctuated between 1998 and 2008 but in 2018 and 2019, possums were undetectable. Possum density was negatively associated with bare ground and positively associated with non-green. Overgrazing by kangaroos likely reduced vegetation cover and diversity and contributed to possum decline, via a reduction in possum food resources and increased exposure to predation. Inconsistent monitoring meant that the population decline was not detected until after it had occurred, and management interventions were not triggered, highlighting the dilemma of allocating scarce monitoring resources.","{""Cale, P."",""Chaber, A."",""McKenzie, T."",""Neilly, H."",""Ward, M.""}","10.1071/am22004",2024-10-03 21:59:48,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""arboreal marsupial; blackbox woodlands; Calperum Station; critical weight range; mammal decline; Mur""}"
6863343,"Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Land Use/Cover Changes In The Pra River Basin, Ghana","Pra River Basin, located in South Central Ghana, is a forest basin that is reported of being threatened with land degradation activities. This study evaluates past and present land use pattern of the basin and determines the spatial variation of land cover classes across it sub-basins. Landsat images, 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2018, were classified using the spectral angle mapping technique. Six land use classes were identified and classified, namely, closed forest, open forest, farm/grassland, settlement, mining, and water. The results showed that the basin has been experiencing changes in the spatial patterns and distribution of LULC classes. Generally, closed forest and open forest decreased with mean values of 10\% and 11\% respectively, towards settlement, farming, and mining which increased with mean values of 7.8\%, 12.4\%, and 1.0\% respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the change in land use classes varied across the sub-basins. Settlement increased consistently in all the sub-basins; however, Oda and Upper Ofin increased greatly towards peri-urban residential and commercial land uses. Similarly, illegal mining activities recorded severe increase in Anum, Birim, Lower Ofin, and Twifu Praso sub-basins. Farm/grassland increased specifically in Lower Pra, Assin Praso, Twifo Praso, Birim, and Upper Ofin sub-basins. The main drivers identified in the study includes population growth and migration, response to socio-economic conditions and policies, and availability of mineral resources. The study illustrates the importance of sub-basin analysis in pinpointing areas at risk for both basin and local level management.","{""Anyemedu, F. O.

6863601,"Ecological Restoration Evaluation Of Afforestation In Gudao Oilfield Based On Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data","The growing petroleum industry poses significant ecological challenges, prompting an increased focus on ecological restoration projects in onshore oilfields. Current efforts focus on revegetation in deforested oilfields, while research remains limited on alternative ecological restoration strategies aimed at establishing new eco-systems in oilfields. This study employed multi-source remote sensing data from 1985 to 2022 to calculate a remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) and constructed an integrated forest health index (IFHI), in order to evaluate the ecological restoration effects in the Gudao shelterbelt of Shengli Oilfield in the Yellow River Delta, and investigated the impact of oil extraction by considering forest phenology. The RSEI of the shelterbelt showed an upward trend and reached a Good level of ecological environment quality from 1990 to 2003, but it declined after that, indicating the potential of RSEI to quickly assess ecological restoration effects and guide management at different stages. Comparing the restoration effects of different tree species, a Robinia pseudoacacia L. (RP) and Fraxinus velutina Torr. (FV) mixed forest demonstrated the greatest capacity to improve environ-mental quality, with the most years (25 years) of the Good and Excellent levels and the highest IFHI value (1.52). In contrast, Ulmus pumila L. (UP) and Sophora japonica L. (SJ) were unsuitable for mixed planting for ecological restoration. The study also found that monospecific RP forests within 30 m of oil wells were significantly impacted by oil extraction (P <= 0.05), necessitating tailored forest management.

6862761,"Mapping Of Groundwater Potential Zones In Pohru Watershed Of Jhelum Basin-Western Himalaya, India Using Integrated Approach Of Remote Sensing, Gis And Ahp","There has been excessive use of groundwater resources owing to dwindling water resource potentialities across the globe. As a result, efficient water resource management has become inevitable. However, locating the groundwater potential zones in dry and mountainous regions of many developing countries which lack suitable economic and human resources is challenging. The integrated approach of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) can offer a solution to this problem as it is useful to fetch first-hand information and has wider applicability. The present study focuses on delineating of groundwater potential zones in Pohru Watershed, of Jhelum Basin-Western Himalaya, India by integrating RS, GIS and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Seven thematic layers, namely lithology, geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, slope, drainage density and lineament density have been used in this study. The parameters were weighted using AHP according to their importance in determining the groundwater potential. Five major groundwater potential zones were identified as: Very High (18.14\%), High (18.17\%), Moderate (19.03\%), Low (41.75\%) and Very Low (2.88\%). The findings reveal that High and Very High Potential Zones are concentrated in the alluvial plains and the adjoining fluvio-lacustrine deposits/ Karewas. However, the highly or moderately dissected hills and the mountain ridges mostly comprise of Low and Very Low groundwater potential zones. The residual hills comprise of Medium and Low groundwater potential zones. The analysis of location and water depth of groundwater wells in the study area was found in accordance with the mapped groundwater potential zones, which validates our study. The Area Under Curve (AUC) value of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for AHP method was calculated as 0.7037, which corresponds to the prediction accuracy of 70.37\%, indicating Moderate to High predictability of groundwater recharge zones for the study region.","{""Ahmad, Syed Towseef"",""Ahmed, Pervez"",""Ahmed, Rayees"",""Dar, Tanveer"",""Javaid, Sumaira"",""Rather, Abid Farooq"",""Wani, Gowhar Farooq""}","10.1007/s12145-022-00824-5",2024-09-30 21:18:27,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2022,"{}","{""Groundwater potential zones; Multicriteria analysis; RS; GIS; AHP; Pohru Watershed-Jhelum Basin-West""}"

For the selected beaches, which differed for typology, location, shape, level of urbanization and tourism, we identified the available surfaces for recreational uses trough the observation of satellite images. WTP results indicate that respondents would be willing to pay a contribution from 9 to 15(sic) per season. WTP is principally positive correlated with some variables like beach frequentation, residence in the localities, available services on the beach. The value of the selected beaches was calculated multiplying the sustainable carrying capacity of each site with their related maximum WTP. It was found that the values of the beaches varied from more than 50M(sic)/season at a popular urban beach to 1M(sic)/season at a remote natural beach. The comparison of beach valuation and investments made by managers of the beaches show a gap. Therefore, the huge non-market value of these beaches might need decision-makers to guarantee continuous beach restoration measures.","{""Carboni, Donatella"",""Corbau, Corinne"",""Madau, Fabio"",""Mazzanti, Massimiliano"",""Parente, Luigi"",""Rodella, Ilaria"",""Simeoni, Umberto""}","10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105130",2024-07-16 22:59:04,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2020,"{}","{""Carrying capacity; Users' perception; Willingness to pay; Beach management; Economic value""}"

6903467,"Spatial Heterogeneity Evaluation And Zoning Of Production-Living-Ecological Space Based On Multi-Source Spatial Data","Production-living-ecological space is a typical spatial carrier to coordinate economic, social, and ecological benefits. Its coordinated development has been greatly significant to promote the ecological civilization, even to optimize the spatial planning in land use. However, the spatial function differentiation is still lacking on the different plots in the same land type, particularly in the most current evaluation on the production-living-ecological space. The clustering or Coordination Degree (CD) is also less sufficient in production-living-ecological space. The purpose of this study is to improve the evaluation system of production-living-ecological space, further to partition its aggregation and coordination degree for the land-use spatial optimization. An integration of multi-source spatial data was implemented to evaluate the functions of production-living-ecological space in different plots with the same land from the grid scale, with emphasis on the perspective of spatial heterogeneity. A systematic analysis was then made on the spatial autocorrelation and trigonometric coordinates. As such, the clustering and coordination characteristics were revealed on the production-living-ecological space on the township scale. Zoning schemes were finally proposed for the optimization of land space. The results are as follows. 1) The high score areas of production space in Hainan Island were concentrated in the coastal cities and counties, indicating the distribution characteristics of ""higher around and lower in the middle, higher in the north and lower in the south"". There were also differences between the urban and rural production spaces. The high score areas of living space were mainly concentrated in the cities and counties, with the spatial pattern of ""small part gathering and most scattered"". The high score areas of ecological space were concentrated in the middle, with the distribution characteristics of ""higher in the middle and lower around"". 2) The Moran's I indexes for the production, life, and ecological space function were 0.569, 0.221 and 0.716, respectively, in Hainan Island obtained from the township scale. It inferred that there was the strongest spatial correlation between the spatial autocorrelation characteristics and ecological space. Therefore, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial clustering. 3) There were great differences in the coordination degree of production-living-ecological space in different towns of Hainan Island. The high value areas were dominated by ecological space and coordinated type, accounting for 51.72% and 43.97% of the total number of towns, respectively. The low value area was dominated by ecology space, accounting for 72.41% of the total number of towns, where no living dominant town was observed. In the case of spatial features, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial coordination. The heterogeneity of spatial functions was effectively identified in the production-living-ecological space for the different plots with the same land type. A specific scheme of production-living-ecological spatial zoning was also proposed from two new perspectives of spatial clustering and coordination degree, suitable for the current practice of land space optimization. An optimization path of production-living-ecological spatial evaluation can provide the zoning schemes, according to the spatial characteristics. The finding can offer a potential decision making for the land space optimization, as well as the construction of free trade port and ecological civilization in Hainan Island of southern China. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

6862751,"A Geoscience-Aware Network (Gaslumnet) Combining Unet And Convnext For Slum Mapping","Approximately 1 billion people worldwide currently inhabit slum areas. The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11.1) underscores the imperative of upgrading all slums by 2030 to ensure adequate housing for everyone. Geo-locations of slums help local governments with upgrading slums and alleviating urban poverty. Remote sensing (RS) technology, with its excellent Earth observation capabilities, can play an important role in slum mapping. Deep learning (DL)-based RS information extraction methods have attracted a lot of attention. Currently, DL-based slum mapping studies typically uses three optical bands to adapt to existing models, neglecting essential geo-scientific information, such as spectral and textural characteristics, which are beneficial for slum mapping. Inspired by the geoscience-aware DL paradigm, we propose the Geoscience-Aware Network for slum mapping (GASlumNet), aiming to improve slum mapping accuracies via incorporating the DL model with geoscientific prior knowledge. GASlumNet employs a two-stream architecture, combining ConvNeXt and UNet. One stream concentrates on optical feature representation, while the other emphasizes geo-scientific features. Further, the feature-level and decision-level fusion mechanisms are applied to optimize deep features and enhance model performance. We used Jilin-1 Spectrum 01 and Sentinel-2 images to perform experiments in Mumbai, India. The results demonstrate that GASlumNet achieves higher slum mapping accuracy than the comparison models, with an intersection over union (IoU) of 58.41%. Specifically, GASlumNet improves the IoU by 4.60~5.97% over the baseline models, i.e., UNet and ConvNeXt-UNet, which exclusively utilize optical bands. Furthermore, GASlumNet enhances the IoU by 10.97% compared to FuseNet, a model that combines optical bands and geo-scientific features. Our method presents a new technical solution to achieve accurate slum mapping, offering potential benefits for regional and global slum mapping and upgrading initiatives. © 2024 by the authors.","{""Feng, Z."",""Hu, Y."",""Lu, W."",""Peng, F."",""Yang, Y.""}","10.3390/rs16020260",2024-07-17 18:49:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{calibration}","{""Conformal mapping"",Geolocations,Geosciences,Housing,""Local government"",""Mapping accuracy"",""Optical bands"",""Optical remote sensing"",Photomapping,Remote-sensing,Semantics,""deep learning"",""geoscience-aware paradigm"",""remote sensing"",""semantic segmentation"",""slum mapping""}"

6863462,"In Situ, Satellite Measurement And Model Evidence On The Dominant Regional Contribution To Fine Particulate Matter Levels In The Paris Megacity","A detailed characterization of air quality in the megacity of Paris (France) during two 1-month intensive campaigns and from additional 1-year observations revealed that about 70 % of the urban background fine particulate matter (PM) is transported on average into the megacity from upwind regions. This dominant influence of regional sources was confirmed by in situ measurements during short intensive and longer-term campaigns, aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from ENVISAT, and modeling results from PMCAMx and CHIMERE chemistry transport models. While advection of sulfate is well documented for other megacities, there was surprisingly high contribution from long-range transport for both nitrate and organic aerosol. The origin of organic PM was investigated by comprehensive analysis of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), radiocarbon and tracer measurements during two intensive campaigns. Primary fossil fuel combustion emissions constituted less than 20 % in winter and 40 % in summer of carbonaceous fine PM, unexpectedly small for a megacity. Cooking activities and, during winter, residential wood burning are the major primary organic PM sources. This analysis suggests that the major part of secondary organic aerosol is of modern origin, i.e., from biogenic precursors and from wood burning. Black carbon concentrations are on the lower end of values encountered in megacities worldwide, but still represent an issue for air quality. These comparatively low air pollution levels are due to a combination of low emissions per inhabitant, flat terrain, and a meteorology that is in general not conducive to local pollution build-up. This revised picture of a megacity only being partially responsible for its own average and peak PM levels has important implications for air pollution regulation policies. © Author(s) 2015.","{""Baklanov, A."",""Baltensperger, U."",""Beekmann, M."",""Beirle, S."",""Borbon, A."",""Borrmann, S."",""Bressi, M."",""Colomb, A."",""Crippa, M."",""Denier Van Der Gon, H.

6863374,"Predictive Soil Mapping Using Historic Bare Soil Composite Imagery And Legacy Soil Survey Data","There is an increasing need for detailed soil property maps to support land use planning, soil carbon accounting, and precision agriculture. While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958-1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75-25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R-2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R-2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R-2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g(-1), with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time.","{""Bedard-Haughn, A.

This article evaluates changes to the Zagros’ Forest cover in 20 years and predicts the implications of implementing the REDD+ project in the next two decades. Using Landsat Forest cover maps and a logistic regression model the potential for forest cover transfer to non-forest regions was modeled to identify regions at risk of deforestation. A Markov chain was implemented to predict the changes. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was employed for validation, and the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) was utilized to model the REDD+ project baseline to predict the forest cover changes. The findings indicate, 37,809 hectares of forest cover were lost in the past 20 years and with this trend, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions will increase. However, implementing the REDD+ project can prevent the release of 1,714,534.13 tCO2e. Therefore, this deteriorating forest possesses the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by preventing deforestation, identifying deforestation-prone areas and implementing the REDD+ project utilizing the methodology presented.

6862999,"Drought Monitoring Of The Wetland In The Tumen River Basin Between 1991 And 2016 Using Landsat Tm/Etm+","Wetland areas are known as ‘the kidneys of the Earth’ because they provide important functions towards stabilizing the environment, long-term protection of water sources, effectively minimizing sediment loss, purifying surface water from industrial and agricultural pollutants, and enhancing aquifer recharge. The condition of water supply in wetlands directly affects the growth of wetland plants and local biodiversity. Therefore, drought monitoring is vital in wetlands. In this study, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) is used to observe the drought status of the wetland in the cross-border (China and North Korea) Tumen River Basin from 1991 to 2016. For this purpose, the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data for six periods were used for the analysis. Soil moisture maps acquired from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System Version 1.0 (CLDAS-V1.0) were then introduced for validating the reliability of the drought monitoring method. The results showed that most areas with a normal moisture level (decreased 25.8%) began experiencing slight drought (increased 29.7%). The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between VTCI and soil moisture showed values of 0.69, 0.32, and 0.2 for 0–5 cm, 0–10 cm, and 10–20 cm thicknesses, respectively. Although climate change probably contributes to the formation of drought by decreasing precipitation (50 mm decrease in Chinese section) and increasing temperature (0.5°C  increase in North Korean section), human activities such as surges in daily water consumption appear as the main threats that leading to droughts in this wetland. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","{""Cui, G."",""Jeon, S.

6903553,"Estimating Community-Level Plant Functional Traits In A Species-Rich Alpine Meadow Using Uav Image Spectroscopy","Plant functional traits at the community level (plant community traits hereafter) are commonly used in trait-based ecology for the study of vegetation–environment relationships. Previous studies have shown that a variety of plant functional traits at the species or community level can be successfully retrieved by airborne or spaceborne imaging spectrometer in homogeneous, species-poor ecosystems. However, findings from these studies may not apply to heterogeneous, species-rich ecosystems. Here, we aim to determine whether unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imaging could adequately estimate plant community traits in a species-rich alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. To achieve this, we compared the performance of four non-parametric regression models, i.e., partial least square regression (PLSR), the generic algorithm integrated with the PLSR (GA-PLSR), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for the retrieval of 10 plant community traits using visible and near-infrared (450–950 nm) UAV hyperspectral imaging. Our results show that chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid content, starch content, specific leaf area and leaf thickness were estimated with good accuracies, with the highest R2 values between 0.64 (nRMSE = 0.16) and 0.83 (nRMSE = 0.11). Meanwhile, the estimation accuracies for nitrogen content, phosphorus content, plant height and leaf dry matter content were relatively low, with the highest R2 varying from 0.3 (nRMSE = 0.24) to 0.54 (nRMSE = 0.20). Among the four tested algorithms, the GA-PLSR produced the highest accuracy, followed by PLSR and XGBoost, and RF showed the poorest performance. Overall, our study demonstrates that UAV-based visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging has the potential to accurately estimate multiple plant community traits for the natural grassland ecosystem at a fine scale. © 2022 by the authors.",NA,"10.3390/rs14143399",2024-10-03 22:22:03,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA

Modelling land use and land cover (LULC) changes is essential for natural resource scientists, decision-makers and planners in developing comprehensive medium and long-term plans for tackling environmental or other related sustainable development issues. The current study used an integrated approach that combines remote sensing and GIS to simulate and predict plausible LULC changes for Dedza district in Malawi for the years 2025 and 2035 based on Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov Chain model embedded in IDRISI Software. The model was validated using a simulated and actual LULC of 2015. The overall agreement between the two maps was 0.98 (98\%) with a simulation error of 0.03 (3.0\%). The more detailed analysis of validation results based on the kappa variations showed a satisfactory level of accuracy with a K-no, K-standard and K-location of 0.97, 0.95 and 0.97, respectively. The future projections indicate that water bodies, barren land and built-up areas will increase while agricultural land, wetlands and forest land will substantially decrease by 2025 and 2035 respectively. According to the transition probability matrix, almost 94.8\%, 97.6\% and 95.7\% of water bodies, agricultural land and barren land will more likely remain stable by 2025. In contrast, forest land exhibits the highest probability of change of 64.8\% and 85.9\% by 2025 and 2035 respectively. Results also indicate that the majority of the forest areas will be converted to barren land with a probability of 60.8\% and 79.6\% by 2025 and 2035, respectively.

This article aims to reinvigorate interest in societal and economic research and applications (SERA) activities within the meteorological and social science communities by exploring key SERA issues and proposing SERA priorities for the next decade.\n\nThe priorities were developed by the authors, building on previous work, with input from a diverse group of social scientists and meteorologists who participated in a SERA workshop in August 2006. The workshop was organized to provide input to the North American regional component of THORPEX: A Global Atmospheric Research Programme, but the priorities identified are broadly applicable to all weather forecast research and applications.\n\nTo motivate and frame SERA activities, we first discuss the concept of high-impact weather forecasts and the chain from forecast creation to value realization. Next, we present five interconnected SERA priority themes—use of forecast information in decision making, communication of forecast uncertainty, user-relevant verification, economic value of forecasts, and decision support— and propose research integrated across the themes.\n\nSERA activities can significantly improve understanding of weather-society interactions to the benefit of the meteorological community and society. However, reaching this potential will require dedicated effort to bring together and maintain a sustainable interdisciplinary community.","{""Morrs, Rebecca""}","https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-89-3-335",2024-04-26 18:48:27,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2008,"{}",NA
6863440,"Geospatial Tools Address Emerging Issues In Spatial Ecology: A Review And Commentary On The Special Issue","Spatial ecology focuses on the role of space and time in ecological processes and events from a local to a global scale and is particularly relevant in developing environmental policy and (mandated) monitoring goals. In other words, spatial ecology is where geography and ecology intersect, and high-quality geospatial data and analysis tools are required to address emerging issues in spatial ecology. In this commentary and review for the International Journal of GIS Special Issue on Spatial Ecology, we highlight selected current research priorities in spatial ecology and describe geospatial data and methods for addressing these tasks. Geoinformation research themes are identified in population ecology, community and landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology, and these themes are further linked to the assessment of ecosystem services. Methods in spatial ecology benefit from explicit consideration of spatial autocorrelation, and applications discussed in this review include species distribution modeling, remote sensing of community and ecosystem properties, and models of climate change. The linkages of the Special Issue papers to these emerging issues are described.","{""Dawson, Terry P."",""Franklin, Janet"",""Pilesjo, Petter"",""Skidmore, Andrew K.""}","10.1080/13658816.2011.554296",2024-07-17 21:28:44,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",2011,"{}","{""Spatial ecology; GIS; remote sensing; environmental change; temporal processes; species distribution""}"
6863359,"Mapping Winter-Wheat Biomass And Grain Yield Based On A Crop Model And Uav Remote Sensing","Timely and accurately estimates of crop biomass and grain yield estimation are crucial for agricultural management. Optical remote sensing techniques can provide crop parameters (e.g., biomass, fractional vegetation cover (FVC)) at regional and larger scales. However, such techniques saturate at high crop canopy cover and cannot detect biomass stored in reproductive organs. The AquaCrop model can be used to estimate FVC, biomass, and grain yield output based on crop growth environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, rainfall, irrigation). In this work, we developed a method for estimating and mapping crop biomass and grain yield using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images and AquaCrop. The combination of low-cost UAV remote sensing data and AquaCrop can be used to map wheat biomass and grain yield before harvest. This work investigated whether biomass and grain yield can be predicted using measurements of biomass and FVC in several winter-wheat fields at an early growing stage using ground-based and remote sensing-based methods. FVC, biomass, and grain yield were measured at several key growing stages (jointing (S1), heading (S2), flowering (S3), grain filling (S4)) and harvest (H) during 2014-2015. We specifically evaluated the performances of using field- and UAV-based FVC and biomass measurements from different growing-stage combinations (e.g., S1-S4, S1-S3, and S1-S2) to calibrate the AquaCrop model and estimate biomass and grain yield. The results indicate that winter-wheat biomass and grain yield can be estimated by calibrating AquaCrop using (i) biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results also reveal that the biomass and grain yield estimated using FVC and AquaCrop have poor accuracy compared with the biomass and grain yield estimated using (i) only biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results suggest that the combined use of UAV remote sensing and AquaCrop can be used to obtain maps of biomass and biomass yield. When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month (13 May) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield agreed with the measured values (biomass: n = 96, coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.61, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.69 t ha(-1), root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 2.10 t ha(-1), normalized RMSE (nRMSE) = 18.5\%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.63, MAE = 0.96 t ha(-1), RMSE = 1.16 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 21.9\%). When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one and a half months (26 April) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield was lower than when estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month before harvest (biomass: n = 144, R (2) = 0.55, MAE = 2.52 t ha(-1), RMSE = 3.34 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 23.6\%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.34, MAE = 1.68 t ha(-1), RMSE = 2.17 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 35.7\%).","{""Feng, Haikuan"",""Li, Zhenhai"",""Xu, Kaijian"",""Yue, Jibo"",""Zhou, Chengquan""}","10.1080/01431161.2020.1823033",2024-07-17 19:13:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{calibration}",NA
6863710,"Geospatial-Based Soil Management Analysis Using Novel Technique For Better Soil Conservation","In the current times, anthropogenic activities and natural change in the processes cause much change in the world, causing multiple hazards and disturbing the natural flow. One such hazard is soil erosion, which is increasing day by day due to changes in climate and anthropogenic activities. Thus, identifying the soil erosion vulnerable zones and map such regions is extremely useful for the town and land planning. Such soil vulnerability mapping gives a quantifiable and reliable method to evaluate soil erosion in a wide variety of circumstances. In the current research, the soil erosion method, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system (GIS), has been applied for soil erosion approximation in the Rawalpindi Tehsil situated in the province of Punjab in the northeast part of Pakistan. The Rawalpindi metropolis is a semi-arid area with a drainage area of 259 km(2) up to the gauging station. The datasets of the RUSLE model were valued from the remote sensing data, and the probable soil loss regions were estimated with the help of GIS. All the datasets, i.e., slope, soil, precipitation, crop management factor, was then used for soil erosion potential mapping. The potential map is generated from the weighted overlay method that gives an output showing that most of the study area is in medium (67.2\%) to high (20.2\%) erosion zone with erosion intensities of < 20 tons ha(-1) year(-1) and < 40 tons ha(-1) year(-1) respectively. Concurrently, few patches lie in high potential zones that need to be looked after and need to be pondered in terms of mitigation measures. Accuracy assessment for land-use and land-cover classes for the Rawalpindi watershed was also accomplished by comparing ground-truth with satellite data, and the Kappa coefficient of the agreement was also obtained. The overall accuracy was 85\%, and the Kappa coefficient was found to be 84\%, inferring the acceptability of results. Few mitigation solutions have also been described in this study, which might be helpful to minimize erosion. This research provides a positive impact on the execution of soil management and preservation practices to lessen the erosion of the soil in the Tehsil Rawalpindi.","{""Aslam, Bilal"",""Khalil, Umer""}","10.1007/s40808-020-01078-0",2024-07-18 21:45:42,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{calibration}","{""Anthropogenic activities; Soil vulnerability; Revised universal soil loss equation; Soil management;""}"
6863014,"Enhancing The Farm Bill's Conservation Potential Through Land Prioritization","The Farm Bill conservation programs serve as the primary tools for the creation and improvement of wildlife habitat on working lands. Wildlife conservation would benefit from a working land-prioritization system that integrates these programs. We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)based system to prioritize land for inclusion in Farm Bill conservation programs. We designed the system to be applicable throughout the United States, to minimize potential conflicts of interest, and to facilitate simple implementation. We designated high conservation value (HCV) lands using habitats of greatest conservation need. We placed priority zones around HCV lands to determine high- and low-priority working lands. Nationwide implementation of this system would require gathering and manipulating data from multiple sources, as well as creation of a GIS layer denoting locations of working lands currently in conservation programs. This system would allow funding to be maximized through the ability to select participation based on property location and size, and to target landowners for participation. The wide-ranging potential benefits of this system make it well-suited for serving as the backbone to conservation on working lands.","{""Baccus, J. T."",""Brown, D. J."",""Connolly, A.

6862720,"Guiding Decisions On The Future Of Dams: A Gis Database Characterizing Ecological And Social Considerations Of Dam Decisions","In the United States and elsewhere, there are a growing number of dams which have exceeded their design life and will need to be repaired or removed in the coming decades. Most of these dams no longer serve their original purpose and removal can provide ecological benefits and eliminate future maintenance costs and hazards. However, many decision-makers have been ill-prepared by community resistance to proposals to remove dams. Given the number of dam removal initiatives that have failed or been delayed due to community resistance, both ecological and social attributes of dams need to be better mapped and conveyed in understandable ways. The goal of this study was to support future decisions regarding dams by 1) developing a set of metrics to assess the social and ecological dimensions of dams, and 2) using these metrics to develop a GIS database, for the 1000+ dams in the Narragansett Bay/Rhode Island area of southern New England. The database characterizes the ecological benefits of dam removal or modification, in terms of fish passage, and the social dimensions that may need to be considered when engaging a community in discussions about the future of a dam. Our emphasis was on small-head dams (i.e. <5 m tall) which comprise most dams in the study area. We created social value metrics that used GIS data to assess dams and their impoundments for potential benefits to waterfront properties, history, sense-of-place, and recreation. We modeled our ecological metrics and ranking system after the Nature Conservancy's Northeast Aquatic Connectivity study which considered factors relating to river connectivity and watershed quality. We evaluated our social and ecological metrics using case studies of dams in the study area that had been previously removed or modified. We assumed that both sets of dams were ecologically important, but the modified dams had higher social value that prohibited their removal. Dams that had been removed or modified were both ranked as high priority in terms of value for fish passage, particularly for diadromous fish. Dams that were modified to include fish passage had substantially larger impoundments, more waterfront properties, and more features associated with recreational or cultural value (e.g. boating opportunity, visibility, etc.). Our social metrics were consistent with expectations based on the limited case studies (7 removals, 19 modifications) available in the study area. We made the dam assessment metrics readily accessible to stakeholders through an interactive ArcGIS Online web map. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","{""Gold, A. J."",""Lowder, K. A."",""Parent, J.

Methods: This paper attempts to design a set of optimal vehicle path from the five aspects of algorithm development stage, algorithm solution idea, data storage mode, analysis data format and algorithm search strategy. According to the relevant theory of urban vehicle path, a mathematical model of vehicle path problem with time window restriction is constructed. Aiming at this model, a{*}, hierarchical algorithm, ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm are used Line analysis and discussion, and according to the relevant algorithm examples in the literature to verify the model and algorithm. Result: It is concluded that the combination of a{*}, ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm is more suitable for the optimization of vehicle routing, and the hierarchical algorithm, road quality, congestion and other real-time traffic obstacles are improved to establish the vehicle routing optimization system in the traffic network and communication network. During the experiment, five road networks of different sizes were used successively. The modulus of these road networks increased sequentially, and the ratio of the number of road sections to the number of road network nodes was about 1698.

The results of the study validated the concept that employer-based identification and repair programs can be carried out in a cost-effective way. On average, each repaired vehicle removed fifty times more carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from Denver air than each CNG conversion. The average cost of each repair was eight times less than the average cost of each conversion. The average fuel economy benefit from the repairs was enough to pay for the average cost of repairs in less than three years of normal driving.

The complex meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship warrants quantitative evaluation. This study investigates the meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network to provide a new research perspective for meteorological satellites in the field of management. For literature analysis, 16 meteorological satellite stakeholders are identified through keyword screening, classified, and coded. A meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network model is then constructed through social network analysis (SNA). Ego, local, and overall networks are analyzed from three perspectives to measure the network principle and to form a relationship network coordination degree evaluation system. The improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is then used to determine index weights and evaluate the relationship network coordination process design comprehensively. In empirical analysis, data for the meteorological satellite Fengyun-4 are obtained through questionnaire survey and literature analysis. Ucinet6 is used to generate relationship networks and analyze various stakeholder roles and status, stakeholder relationship network coordination degree, and evaluation results. The results demonstrate that the competent meteorological satellite department, the meteorological administration, the National Meteorological Centre, and the government are in the center of the Fengyun-4 stakeholder relationship network, with coordination degree in an ""average"" state.

6903497,"A Framework For Assessment Of Flood Conditions Using Hydrological And Hydrodynamic Modeling Approach","River flooding has been triggering significant damage to lives and infrastructure and is a major worry all around the globe. To lessen these losses, proper planning and management methods need to be deployed. The purpose of this research is to fill a knowledge gap on the effects of reservoirs operation of the Idukki and Idamalyar to Periyar River Basin massive flooding. The proposed methodology is implemented on the Periyar River Basin located in Kerala, India, where severe flooding occurred during monsoon season in the year 2018. In this study, modelling technique has been used in two-step: (1) development of 1D physically based, distributed-parameter model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) to compute the stream flow and estimate the stream discharge at different outlet points; and (2) hybrid model is developed by linking SWAT with a well-known 2D hydrodynamic model (International River Interface Cooperative, iRIC) to display flood scenarios and to identify the flood-prone areas. The ArcSWAT user interface employed in the ArcGIS software was utilized to delineate the river basin. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated on daily and monthly basis at two gauge discharge stations, i.e., Neeleeswaram and Kalady. The statistical coefficients result obtained from SWAT model was in good agreement with the measured values for calibration and validation. The hybrid model simulation results compared with observed flood depth and remote sensing data demonstrated good capability of the model. Agreeable performances of computed results were observed in both flow fields and flood propagations. The result was compared with 2018 flood to check model accuracy and found to be satisfactory. The proposed framework can be utilized as an effective tool for efficient planning and management of natural disasters, such as flash floods. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,"10.3390/w15071371",2024-09-27 23:30:48,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{""model not data""}",NA
6863226,"Place-Based Landscape Services And Potential Of Participatory Spatial Planning In Multifunctional Rural Landscapes In Southern Highlands, Tanzania","Context: Local scale assessments of ecosystem/landscape services in Africa are insufficient and lack relevance in landscape management. Also, few studies have explored the potential benefits of PGIS/PPGIS approaches for landscape management and stewardship among the participating stakeholders. Objectives: Our aim is (1) to establish an understanding of the realization of landscape services at the local scale across three multifunctional rural landscapes in Tanzania through PGIS/PPGIS approaches and (2) to create an understanding of these approaches’ potential to support participatory spatial planning. Methods: Semi-structured surveys (n = 313) including participatory mapping of provisioning and cultural landscape services were organised to characterise their spatial patterns. The survey results were shared with the communities (n = 97) in workshops where services were ranked and the participants interviewed about their map-reading capacity, personal learning experiences, and their ability to use maps to express opinions. Results: The most abundant landscape services are sites for social gatherings and cultivation. The spatial patterns of provisioning services are realizations of human benefits from the patterns of the biophysical landscape. Overall, cultural landscape services show clustering and small spatial extent (except aesthetics). The PGIS/PPGIS approach allows for local-level, spatially specific discussions between stakeholders. The visual power of maps and satellite images is particularly emphasised. Conclusion: In the data-scarce context common in the Global South, the participatory mapping of landscape services has the potential to advance understanding of the benefits that the landscape has for the local communities and how this information, when mapped spatially, can be integrated with local-level planning practices. © 2019, The Author(s).","{""Arki, V."",""Eilola, S."",""Fagerholm, N."",""Kisanga, D."",""Käyhkö, N.""}","10.1007/s10980-019-00847-2",2024-07-17 21:33:25,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{interesting,""participatory mapping""}","{Africa,""Ecosystem services"",""Land use planning"",""Landscape services"",""Participatory mapping""}"
6863463,"Flood Hazard Assessment In Large Plain Basins With A Scarce Slope In The Pampean Plain, Argentina","Floods are one of the most common natural phenomena and represent a serious hazard when they affect human activities. Structural measures are commonly used to mitigate them; however, these do not always give good results, mainly in plain areas with scarce slope. In this sense, the generation of a flood hazard map contributes to adequate hazard management and disaster prevention. The aim of this work is to evaluate the flood hazard areas in hydrological plain basins with scarce slope, taking as a case study the Samborombon river basin located in the Pampean Plain, Argentina. For this, a flood hazard map was made based on the analytical hierarchy process and using a GIS, taking into account physical aspects of the terrain, observations, and field measurements. Likewise, the map was validated using satellite images and the inhabitants in danger in the basin were quantified. The results show that the flood hazard areas correspond mainly to the floodplain of rivers and tributaries, while the main and secondary divide zones have low flood hazard sectors. On the other hand, numerous urban settlements were identified within flood hazard areas, these being urban settlements in the vicinity of old urban centers and new gated communities with high value homes, quantifying 1961 inhabitants at flood hazard and showing poor territorial planning.

6903509,"Forest, Wetland And Biodiversity: Revealing Multi-Faceted Ecological Services From Ecorestoration Of A Degraded Tropical Landscape","With the deterioration of tropical forests, the loss of species, their habitat and linked socio-ecological degradation is regrettably becoming widespread. Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

6863373,"Soft Classification Of Mixed Seabed Objects Based On Fuzzy Clustering Analysis Using Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Data","Coastal seabed mapping is essential for a variety of nearshore management related activities including sustainable resource management, ecological protection, and environmental change detection in coastal sites. Recently introduced airborne LIDAR bathymetry (ALB) sensors allow, under favorable environmental conditions and mapping requirements, time and cost efficient collection of shallow coastal seabed data in comparison to acoustic techniques. One important application of these sensors, given ALB seabed footprint size on the order to several meters in diameter for shallow waters, is the development of seabed classification maps and techniques to classify both benthic species and seabed sediment. The coastal seabed is a complex environment consisting of diverse habitats and, thus, necessitates classification methods which readily account for seabed class heterogeneity. Recent ALB classification studies have relied on classification techniques that assign each ALB shot to a single seabed class (i.e., hard classification) instead of allowing for assignment to multiple seabed classes which may be present in an illuminated ALB footprint (i.e., soft classification). In this study, a soft seabed classification (SSC) algorithm is developed using unsupervised classification with fuzzy clustering to produce classification products accounting for a sub-footprint habitat mixture. With this approach, each shot is assigned to multiple seabed classes with a percentage cover measuring the extent to which each seabed class is present in the ALB footprint. This has the added benefit of generating smooth spatial ecological transitions of the seabed instead of sharp boundaries between classes or clusters. Furthermore, due to the multivariate nature of the SSC output (i.e., percentage cover for each seabed class for a given shot), a recently developed self-organizing map neural network-based approach to geo-visualization of seabed classification results was used to visualize seabed habitat diversity. An ALB dataset of an area approximately 20000 m(2) collected from Quebec, Canada was used. Cross-validation of the SSC approach yields percentage cover accuracy of approximately 71.7\% with 16 seabed classes for a real ALB dataset, while dominant seabed class prediction based on hardening of percentage cover predictions yielded 66\% accuracy for 4 seabed classes.

6691693,"Economic Value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Agriculture: Review of Ex-Ante Assessments and Recommendations for Future Research","Advanced information in the form of seasonal climate forecasts has the potential to improve farmers’ decision making, leading to increases in farm profits. Interdisciplinary initiatives seeking to understand and exploit the potential benefits of seasonal forecasts for agriculture have produced a number of quantitative ex-ante assessments of the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts. The realism, robustness, and credibility of such assessments become increasingly important as efforts shift from basic research toward applied research and implementation. This paper surveys published evidence about the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for agriculture, characterizing the agricultural systems, approaches followed, and scales of analysis. The climate forecast valuation literature has contributed insights into the influence of forecast characteristics, risk attitudes, insurance, policy, and the scale of adoption on the value of forecasts. Key innovations in the more recent literature include explicit treatment of the uncertainty of forecast value estimates, incorporation of elicited management responses into bioeconomic modeling, and treatment of environmental impacts, in addition to financial outcomes of forecast response. It is argued that the picture of the value of seasonal forecasts for agriculture is still incomplete and often biased, in part because of significant gaps in published valuation research. Key gaps include sampling of a narrow range of farming systems and locations, incorporation of an overly restricted set of potential management responses, failure to consider forecast responses that could lead to “regime shifts,” and failure to incorporate state-of-the-art developments in seasonal forecasting. This paper concludes with six recommendations to enhance the realism, robustness, and credibility of ex-ante valuation of seasonal climate forecasts.","{""Meza, Francisco""}","https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JAMC1540.1",2024-04-23 22:18:04,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2008,"{""scf != esi""}","{""Economic value|Seasonal forecasting|Climate prediction|Agriculture""}"

The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi Basin in the Lesser Himalaya, India, in district Nainital has been selected for the case illustration. The average rate of erosion hazard is 0. 68 mm/year or 224 tons/km2/year. Anthropogenic and geo-environmental factors have together significantly accelerated the rate of erosion. This reconnaissance study estimates the erosion rate over the period of 3 years (2006-2008) as 1.21 mm/year (398 tons/km2/year) in the barren land having geological background of diamictite, siltstone and shale rocks, 0.92 mm/year (302 tons/km2/year) in the agricultural land with lithology of diamictite, slates, siltstone, limestone rocks, while in the forest land, it varies between 0. 20 mm/year (66 tons/km2/year) under dense forest land having the geology of quartzwacke and quartrenite rocks and 0.40 mm/year (132 tons/km2/year) under open forest/shrubs land having geological setup of shale, dolomite and gypsum rocks. Compared to the intensity of erosion in the least disturbed dense forest, the erosion rate is about 5-6 times higher in the most disturbed agricultural land and barren land, respectively. The erosion hazard zones delineated following scalogram modelling approach. Integrated scalogram modelling approach resulted in severe classes of soil erosion hazard in the study area with numerical values of Erosion Hazard Index (EHI) ranging between 01 (very low hazard) and 5 (very high hazard). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","{""Pant, C.

The sole infected horse was euthanized in moribund condition. As the southernmost recognised HeV spill-over detection to date, it extends the southern limit of known cases by approximately 95 km. The event occurred near a large urban centre, characterised by equine populations of diverse type, husbandry, and purpose, with low HeV vaccination rates.Urgent multi-agency outbreak response involved risk assessment and monitoring of 11 exposed people and biosecurity management of at-risk animals. No human or additional animal cases were recognised.This One Health investigation highlights need for research on risk perception and strategic engagement to support owners confronted with the death of companion animals and potential human exposure to a high consequence virus. The location and timing of this spill-over event diverging from that established for prototype HeV (HeV-g1), highlight benefit in proactive One Health surveillance and research activities that improve understanding of dynamic transmission and spill-over risks of both HeV genotypic lineages and related but divergent emerging pathogens.","{""Annand, Edward J."",""Bennett, Jane"",""Durrheim, David N."",""Eby, Peggy"",""Eden, John-Sebastian"",""Finlaison, Deborah"",""Hodgson, Evelyn"",""Horsburgh, Bethany A."",""Kerr, James"",""Kirkland, Peter"",""Massey, Peter D."",""Peel, Alison J."",""Taylor, Joanne"",""Thompson, Kirrilly"",""Wood, Kelly""}","10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100423",2024-09-30 21:29:26,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2022,"{""sentinel disease research"",spurious}",NA
6863513,"An Assessment Of The Use Of Remote Sensing To Map Habitat Features Important To Sustaining Lamprey Populations","1. This study describes the use of colour aerial photography and Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) multispectral imagery (420-1050 nm) to map gravel-bed river habitats important to Sustaining river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis)-an aquatic species with high conservation interest in Europe. The accuracy of the remote sensing approach wits assessed by comparing the Output from automated mapping of physical habitat features using image analysis and GIS and habitat maps derived from field Survey. 2. Unsupervised classification of the aerial photography and ATM imagery mapped hydraulic habitat such as pools and riffles with overall accuracies of 57\% and 65.5\%, respectively. Submerged sand and silt deposits, which are important to river lamprey ammocoetes could not be identified on the imagery by simple unsupervised or Supervised classification. They Could be mapped indirectly, however, by association between their presence and morphological attributes such as backwaters and embayments in the bank profile detectable on the imagery. Remotely determining the likely presence and location of lamprey ammocoete habitat can be useful in planning detailed electrofishing campaigns to estimate lamprey densities, to assess conservation status and any change over time, and to determine the need for restoration strategies. 3. The results suggest that on rivers wider than 20m without a continuous wooded riparian fringe, and where there is good quality imagery, it is possible to automate mapping of physical habitat features; important to many river species with high nature conservation interest. As a result organizations charged with monitoring and conserving river species should consider investing in airborne imagery covering river sytems of high conservation value.

6863345,"Surface Coal Mining Impacts On Land Use Change And Ecological Service Value: A Case Study In Shengli Coalfield, Inner Mongolia","Coal plays a crucial role in global economic development and remains the most common and widely distributed fossil fuel worldwide. As the world's largest developing country, China's mining and utilization of coal resources have contributed significantly to the country’s rapid economic growth. Inner Mongolia is an ecologically fragile arid and semi-arid area of China. The exploitation of opencast mining has seriously hindered the sustainable use of regional land and the residents' well-being. Using ENVI-based remote sensing images from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, this study employed a random forest algorithm to divide land utilization types into construction land, vegetation, cultivated land, bare land, and water areas and analyzed the characteristics of land use and ecosystem service value changes over the past 20 years. The results were as follows: (1) Construction land in the mining area changed minimally from 2000 to 2020; vegetation and water bodies showed a decreasing trend, whereas bare and cultivated lands showed an increasing trend. Bare land exhibited the largest change in area proportion and water bodies the smallest. (2) The total ecosystem service value of the mining area declined from 10.939 to 9.527 billion Yuan. Vegetation ecosystem service value was the highest, followed by cultivated land and water, with the bare land ecosystem service value the lowest. (3) On a spatial scale, the total ecosystem service value of the Shengli mining area decreased year by year, indicating that land use changes in the mining area do have an impact on ecosystem service value. © 2022, The Author(s).","{""Chen, Y."",""Guo, J."",""Qiao, Y."",""Su, X."",""Wang, L."",""Ying, L."",""Zhai, Z."",""Zhang, L."",""Zhou, J."",""Zhou, X."",""Zhou, Y.""}","10.1007/s40789-022-00518-9",2024-07-12 19:33:50,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Bare lands"",China,Coal,""Coal deposits"",""Cultivated lands"",""Decision trees"",""Developing countries"",ESV,Economics,""Ecosystem service values"",Ecosystems,""Inner Mongolia"",""Land use"",""Land use change"",""Landuse change"",""Mining areas"",""Nei Monggol"",""Remote sensing"",Spatial,Spatial,""Transformed matrix"",Vegetation,algorithm,""coal mining"",""economic development"",""ecosystem service"",""fossil fuel"",""land use change"",matrix,""opencast mining"",""temporal change"",""temporal changes"",""vegetation cover""}"
6863003,"Classification Of Rare Land Cover Types: Distinguishing Annual And Perennial Crops In An Agricultural Catchment In South Korea","Many environmental data are inherently imbalanced, with some majority land use and land cover types dominating over rare ones. In cultivated ecosystems minority classes are often the target as they might indicate a beginning land use change. Most standard classifiers perform best on a balanced distribution of classes, and fail to detect minority classes. We used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) with Random Forest to classify land cover classes in a small agricultural catchment in South Korea using MODIS time series. This area faces a major soil erosion problem and policy measures encourage farmers to replace annual by perennial crops to mitigate this issue. Our major goal was therefore to improve the classification performance on annual and perennial crops. We compared four different classification scenarios on original imbalanced and synthetically oversampled balanced data to quantify the effect of SMOTE on classification performance. SMOTE substantially increased the true positive rate of all oversampled minority classes. However, the performance on minor classes remained lower than on the majority class. We attribute this result to a class overlap already present in the original data set that is not resolved by SMOTE. Our results show that resampling algorithms could help to derive more accurate land use and land cover maps from freely available data. These maps can be used to provide information on the distribution of land use classes in heterogeneous agricultural areas and could potentially benefit decision making.","{""Bogner, Christina"",""Reineking, Bjorn"",""Rohner, Dorian"",""Seo, Bumsuk""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0190476",2024-09-30 17:23:04,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2018,"{}",NA
6862744,"A Geospatial Analysis For An Integrated Land Use And Water Strategy For Bagmati River In Kathmandu Valley, Nepal","Bagmati River in Kathmandu Valley is one of the most important and revered rivers in Nepal. However, it is the most polluted river in the country. The discharge of raw wastewater in the river, the dumping of garbage at the riverbanks, missing regulations of proper disposal and a lack of education of the population are resulting in an unsatisfactory condition of the river. Community involvement is not planned in the current state of the management strategy. This chapter is an assessment of the current state of Bagmati River based on three indicators: the role of local stakeholders in the management system, water quality and the role of water in the urban dynamics. On the basis of 240 household surveys we identified the income and financial reserves of the locals and the religious and cultural values. These aspects play a significant role in implementing new adaptions of technologies and in implementing new rules and guidelines. The spatial analysis was conducted with the use of GIS and remote sensing through updating the land use plan that was the basis for an interactive map enhanced by a photographic record built on site. The map facilitated us to locate 10 sampling sites along the stretch of Bagmati River and its main tributaries, where water samples were extracted. The samples were examined under physico-chemical, chemical and biochemical water quality parameters. The contrast of the land use map and the lab results enabled us to see the impact of the different urban land uses and urban activities on the water quality. The results reveal that the water quality of Bagmati River is currently extremely low and in urgent need of interventions from all types of stakeholders, for which we provide recommendations. © 2024 selection and editorial matter Walter Timo de Vries, Iwan Rudiarto, N.M.P.

For this purpose, a supervised classification was carried out in five-year periods based on satellite images, Google Earth support and the land use thematic classification established by the National Forest Corporation in 2011. From this, it was determined qualitatively and quantitatively change the territory according to thematic cartography and a confusion matrix. In addition, the population increase was determined based on data published for 2017 by the Statistics Institute of Chile and the determination of potential vehicular load established in the field, with the support of sample units. Overall, the analysis is the basis for road identification and improvement of the area and its connectivity to structuring routes, from the perspective of objective image, with the support of methodologies and inputs from geomatics, topographic concepts, the projection of new alternatives vials and ground support.

6903597,"Estimation Of Grain Protein Content In Commercial Bread And Durum Wheat Fields Via Traits Inverted By Radiative Transfer Modelling From Sentinel-2 Timeseries","Wheat (Triticum spp.) is crucial to food security. Grain protein content (GPC) is key to its nutritional and economic value and is controlled by genetic and agronomic factors, soil properties and weather. GPC prediction from remote sensing could reduce nitrogen (N) losses, help management decisions, and improve profit. However, GPC prediction is complex because multiple plant traits influence GPC and their effects change through the growing season. Traits with known physiological links to GPC, which can be retrieved from imaging spectroscopy, include leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll (Ca+b), and stress indicators. Further inspection of these and other traits retrieved from satellite data can advance research relevant to precision agriculture. Sentinel-2 (S2) timeseries (TS) were acquired for 6,355 ha of commercial dryland bread (T. aestivum) and durum (T. durum) wheat fields in south-east Australia through two consecutive years with dissimilar rainfall. Wheat growers provided similar to 92,000 GPC data points from harvester-mounted protein monitors. For each, Ca+b, leaf dry matter, leaf water content (C-w) and LAI were retrieved from the S2 images by radiative transfer model inversion. A gradient boosted machine learning algorithm was applied to analyse these traits' importance to GPC and to predict GPC in 30\% of samples unseen by the algorithm in training. The strongest relationships between predicted and observed GPC (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.56 \%), in a model built from five S2 images across a season, were better than those from single-date hyperspectral (HS). In severe water stress, LAI was the main predictor of GPC early in the season, but this switched to C-w later. Trait importance was more evenly distributed in milder conditions. S2 TS had a clear accuracy advantage over single-date S2 and HS, especially in benign conditions, emphasising the potential of S2 TS for large-scale GPC monitoring.",NA,"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.10.018",2024-09-27 22:49:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863539,"The Influence Of Morphological Characteristics Of Green Patch On Its Surrounding Thermal Environment","In order to explore the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches on its surrounding thermal environment, the remote sensing image data of Taiyuan City was used as the basic data source, and the temperature field under the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches was simulated by CFD technique. The dimensionless parameter of relative temperature change rate was introduced as the index of thermal environment effect. From the existing shape index reflecting the patch characteristics, the indicators of the green patch affecting the surrounding thermal environment were screened out, and the corresponding quantitative relationship between them was established. Based on the statistical analysis of patch shape index and thermal environment effect index, it is pointed out that the deviation degree for equivalent perimeter of patch is positively correlated with the relative change rate of temperature reflecting thermal environment effect. Meanwhile, the smaller area of green space can be used to improve local microclimate. The introduction of CFD technology into the study of urban thermal environment provides a basis for exploring the key parameters to improve the ecological environment benefits of urban green space and determining the shape control index of patch in green space planning and design. On the other hand, the simulation function of CFD technology is used to optimize green space design, which has better significance to guide production practice.","{""Guo, Jinping"",""Lin, Wenqi"",""Liu, Yanhong"",""Shamseldin, Asaad Y."",""Wei, Qingshun""}","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105594",2024-10-03 17:36:52,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Green patch; Morphological characteristics; Thermal environmental effect; CFD; Numerical simulation""}"
6863112,"Mapping Tropical Forest Biomass With Radar And Spaceborne Lidar In Lopé National Park, Gabon: Overcoming Problems Of High Biomass And Persistent Cloud","Spatially-explicit maps of aboveground biomass are essential for calculating the losses and gains in forest carbon at a regional to national level. The production of such maps across wide areas will become increasingly necessary as international efforts to protect primary forests, such as the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) mechanism, come into effect, alongside their use for management and research more generally. However, mapping biomass over high-biomass tropical forest is challenging as (1) direct regressions with optical and radar data saturate, (2) much of the tropics is persistently cloud-covered, reducing the availability of optical data, (3) many regions include steep topography, making the use of radar data complex, (5) while LiDAR data does not suffer from saturation, expensive aircraft-derived data are necessary for complete coverage. We present a solution to the problems, using a combination of terrain-corrected L-band radar data (ALOS PALSAR), spaceborne LiDAR data (ICESat GLAS) and ground-based data. We map Gabon's Lopé National Park (5000 km2) because it includes a range of vegetation types from savanna to closed-canopy tropical forest, is topographically complex, has no recent contiguous cloud-free high-resolution optical data, and the dense forest is above the saturation point for radar. Our 100 m resolution biomass map is derived from fusing spaceborne LiDAR (7142 ICESat GLAS footprints), 96 ground-based plots (average size 0.8 ha) and an unsupervised classification of terrain-corrected ALOS PALSAR radar data, from which we derive the aboveground biomass stocks of the park to be 78 Tg C (173 Mg C ha-1). This value is consistent with our field data average of 181 Mg C ha-1, from the field plots measured in 2009 covering a total of 78 ha, and which are independent as they were not used for the GLAS-biomass estimation. We estimate an uncertainty of ± 25% on our carbon stock value for the park. This error term includes uncertainties resulting from the use of a generic tropical allometric equation, the use of GLAS data to estimate Lorey's height, and the necessity of separating the landscape into distinct classes. As there is currently no spaceborne LiDAR satellite in operation (GLAS data is available for 2003-2009 only), this methodology is not suitable for change-detection. This research underlines the need for new satellite LiDAR data to provide the potential for biomass-change estimates, although this need will not be met before 2015. © 2012 Author(s).","{""Abernethy, K.

6863052,"Lidar-Based Classification Of Sagebrush Community Types","Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities constitute the largest temperate semidesert in North America and provide important rangelands for livestock and habitat for wildlife. Remote sensing methods might provide an efficient method to monitor sagebrush communities. This study used airborne LiDAR and field data to measure vegetation heights in five different community types at the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, southwestern Idaho: herbaceous-dominated, low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula) -dominated, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp.) -dominated, bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) -dominated, and other vegetation community types. The objectives were 1) to quantify the correlation between field-measured and airborne LiDAR-derived shrub heights, and 2) to determine if airborne LiDAR-derived mean vegetation heights can be used to classify the five community types. The dominant vegetation type and vegetation heights were measured in 3 × 3 m field plots. The LiDAR point cloud data were converted into a raster format to generate a maximum vegetation height map in 3-m raster cells. The regression relationship between field-based and airborne LiDAR-derived shrub heights was significant (R2=0.77; P value <0.001). An analysis of variance test with all pairwise post hoc comparisons indicated that LiDAR-derived vegetation heights were significantly different among all vegetation community types (all P values <0.01), except for herbaceous-dominated communities compared to low sagebrush-dominated communities. Although LiDAR measurements consistently underestimated vegetation heights in all community types, shrub heights at some locations were overestimated due to adjacent taller vegetation. We recommend for future studies a smaller rasterized pixel size that is consistent with the target vegetation canopy diameter. © Society for Range Management.","{""Bond, P."",""Sankey, T.

6863651,"Spatial Modeling Of Litter And Soil Carbon Stocks On Forest Land In The Conterminous United States","Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phenology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 ± 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 ± 2.38 Mg ha −1 , and the soil C stock at 0–20 cm depth was 14.68 ± 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 ± 8.98 Mg ha −1 . This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables. © 2018","{""Cao, B."",""Domke, G.

6863219,"Virtual Laser Scanning With Helios++: A Novel Take On Ray Tracing-Based Simulation Of Topographic Full-Waveform 3d Laser Scanning","Topographic laser scanning is a remote sensing method to create detailed 3D point cloud representations of the Earth's surface. Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are met: (i) models of 3D scene and scanner are available and (ii) modelling of the beam-scene interaction is simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. Such model types include meshes, digital terrain models, point clouds and partially transmissive voxels, which are especially useful in laser scanning simulations of vegetation. In a scene, object models of different types can be combined, so that representations spanning multiple spatial scales in different resolutions and levels of detail are possible. HELIOS++ follows a modular design, where the core components of platform, scene, and scanner can be individually interchanged, and easily configured. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create full-waveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. We show how HELIOS++ positions among other VLS software in terms of input model support and simulation of beam divergence in a literature survey. We also perform a direct comparison of simulations with DART, where we employ a scene from the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI). This example shows that HELIOS++ takes about 10 times longer than DART for parsing and preparing the 3D scene, but performs about 314,000 times faster in the beam simulation, achieving 200,000 rays/s. Comparing HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, revealed reduced runtimes by up to 99%. Virtually scanned point clouds may be used for a broad range of applications as shown in literature. We could identify four main categories of use cases prevailing at present, which benefit from simulated LiDAR point clouds: data acquisition planning, method evaluation, method training and sensing experimentation. We conclude that a general-purpose LiDAR simulator can be employed for many different scientific applications, as long as it is ensured that the simulation adequately represents reality, which is specific to the given research question. © 2021 The Authors","{""Anders, K."",""Esmorís Pena, A.

6863287,"Temporal And Spatial Modelling Of Tropical Deforestation: A Survival Analysis Linking Satellite And Household Survey Data","We estimate a spatially explicit model of the forest clearance process among smallholder farmers in an agricultural frontier of southern Mexico. Our analysis takes as its point of departure a simple utility-maximising model that suggests many possible determinants of deforestation in an economic environment characterised by missing or thin markets. Hypotheses from the model are tested on a data set that combines a time series of satellite imagery with data collected from a survey of farm households whose agricultural plots were geo-referenced using a global positioning system (GPS). We implement a survival analysis to identify the effect of household level explanatory variables on the probability of deforestation. This approach allows us to introduce a measure of the time until clearance as a covariate, thereby affording a control for the effect of potentially important explanatory variables that vary through time but are not directly observable. In addition to identifying several variables relevant for policy analysis, including household demographics, proximity to roads, and government provision of agricultural support, model results suggest that the deforestation process is characterised by non-linear duration dependence, with the probability of forest clearance first decreasing and then increasing with the passage of time.

6862901,"Estimation Of Crop Water Productivity Using Gis And Remote Sensing Techniques","The global demand for food is growing with the population and urbanization, which puts pressure on water resources, which need assessing and quantifying water requirements. Adopting efficient irrigation methods to optimize water use is essential in this situation. In this study, crop water productivity (CWP) of major crops in the Rohri canal command area was estimated by the ratio of yield and actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Analyzing the CWP of major crops, water scarcity challenges can be tackled by selecting the most feasible irrigation methods. However, ETa was calculated and aggregated for all four stages of the crop growth period: initial, crop development, flowering stage, and maturity seasons. The crop yield data were obtained from the districts' agricultural statistics. For this purpose, evapotranspiration products of Landsat 5 and 8 were downloaded from Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux). Landsat images were processed in a GIS environment to calculate ETa. The approach suggests developing a CWP database for major crops like wheat, cotton, and rice to improve irrigation water management. The objectives of this study are to estimate and analyze the difference in the CWP and evapotranspiration of major crops for the Rabi and Kharif seasons with high and moderate flows during 1998-2019.

6862747,"Assessment Of Mangrove Response To Projected Relative Sea-Level Rise And Recent Historical Reconstruction Of Shoreline Position","We predict the decadal change in position of three American Samoa mangroves from analysis of a time series of remotely sensed imagery, a geographic information system, tide gauge data, and projections for change in sea-level relative to the mangrove surface. Accurate predictions of changes to coastal ecosystem boundaries, including in response to projected relative sea-level rise, enable advanced planning to minimize and offset anticipated losses and minimize social disruption and cost of reducing threats to coastal development and human safety. The observed mean landward migration of three mangroves' seaward margins over four decades was 25, 64, and 72 mma-1, 12 to 37 times the observed relative sea-level rise rate. Two of the sites had clear trends in reductions in mangrove area, where there was a highly significant correlation between the change in position of the seaward mangrove margin and change in relative sea-level. Here it can be inferred that the force of sea-level rise relative to the mangrove surface is causing landward migration. Shoreline movement was variable at a third site and not significantly correlated with changing sea-level, where it is likely that forces other than change in relative sea-level are predominant. Currently, 16.5%, 23.4%, and 68.0% of the three mangroves' landward margins are obstructed by coastal development from natural landward migration. The three mangroves could experience as high as a 50.0% reduction in area by the year 2100. A 12% reduction in mangrove area by the year 2100 is possible in the Pacific islands region. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","{""Coleman, R."",""Ellison, J."",""Gilman, E.""}","10.1007/s10661-006-9212-y",2024-07-18 20:50:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2007,"{}","{""American Samoa"",Climate,Coastal,""Coastal development"",""Coastal zones"",""Environmental impact assessments"",Erosion,Forecasting,Forestry,""Geographic Information Systems"",""History, 20th Century"",""History, 21st Century"",Mangrove,Oceanography,""Pacific islands"",Rhizophoraceae,""Risk Assessment"",""Sea level"",""Sea-level rise"",Seawater,""Shore protection"",""Shoreline position"",""Tide gages"",""Time series analysis"",Wetland,Wetlands,accuracy,article,""correlation analysis"",""cost benefit analysis"",ecosystem,""ecosystem response"",""environmental assessment"",""environmental effect"",""environmental factor"",""geographic information system"",imagery,migration,nonhuman,prediction,reconstruction,safety,""sea level change"",""sea level rise"",seashore,shoreline,""soil erosion""}"

The potential for synergies between remote sensing science and ecology, especially satellite remote sensing and conservation biology, has been highlighted by many in the past. Yet, the two research communities have only recently begun to coordinate their agendas. Such synchronization is the key to improving the potential for satellite data effectively to support future environmental management decision-making processes. With this themed issue, we aim to illustrate how integrating remote sensing into ecological research promotes a better understanding of the mechanisms shaping current changes in biodiversity patterns and improves conservation efforts.

This technique is particularly important for nations which do not already have an accurate agricultural reporting system. Better forecasts have important economic effects. International grain traders can make better decisions about when to store, buy and sell. Farmers can make better planting decisions by taking advantage of production estimates for areas out of phase with their own agricultural calendar. World economic benefits will accrue to both buyers and sellers because of increased food supply and price stabilization.

Flooding, in particular, is one of the most damaging natural disasters globally and is projected to increase in many regions. However, estimating the value of “green infrastructure” in mitigating downstream floods remains a challenge. We estimate the economic value of flood mitigation by the Otter Creek floodplains and wetlands to Middlebury, VT, for Tropical Storm Irene and nine other floods. We used first principles to simulate hydrographs for scenarios with and without flood mitigation by upstream wetlands and floodplains. We then mapped flood extents for each scenario and calculated monetary damages to inundated structures. Our analysis indicates damage reductions of 84–95% for Tropical Storm Irene and 54–78% averaged across all 10 events. We estimate that the annual value of flood mitigation services provided to Middlebury, VT, exceeds $126,000 and may be as high as $450,000. Economic impacts of this magnitude stress the importance of floodplain and wetland conservation, warrant the consideration of ecosystem services in land use decisions, and make a compelling case for the role of green infrastructure in building resilience to climate change.","{""Galford, Gillian"",""O'Niel-Dunne, Jarlath"",""Polasky, Stephen"",""Ricketts, Taylor"",""Watson, Keri B.""}","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.05.015",NA,NA,NA,2016,"{}","{""Climate resilience"",""Economic valuation"",""Ecosystem services"",""Flood mitigation"",""Green infrastructure""}"

The study was carried out at Thathe Vondo Area, which is characterised by episodic variation of vegetation gain and loss. This variation is attributable to timber and tea plantations and their production cycles, which periodically result in either vegetation gain or loss. The approach presented here was implemented on two ASTER images acquired in 2007 and 2017. It involved the combined use of band combination, unsupervised image classification and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) techniques. True colour composite (TCC) images for 2007 and 2017 were created from combination of bands 1, 2 and 3 in red, blue and green, respectively. The difference image of the TCC images was then generated to show the inconsistencies of vegetation cover between 2007 and 2017. For analytical simplicity and interpretability, the difference image was subjected to ISODATA unsupervised classification, which clustered pixels in the difference image into eight classes. Two ISODATA derived classes were interpreted as vegetation gain and one as vegetation loss. These classes were confimed as regions of vegetation gain and loss by NDVI values of 2007 and 2017. In addition, the polygons of vegetation gain and loss regions were created and superimposed over the TCC images to further demonstrate the spatiotemporal vegetation change in the area. The vegetation change statistics show vegetation gain and loss of 10.62\% and 2.03\%, respectively, implying a vegetation gain of 8.59\% over the selected decade. Significance: Vegetation change detection is essential in environmental monitoring and management of an area. This study presents a simple approach for assessing vegetation change over time. The approach involves change detection through the difference of spectral values of vegetation pixels of time series remotely sensed images.",NA,"10.17159/sajs.2021/8226",2024-10-01 17:31:00,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6862858,"New Approach For Using Remotely Sensed Chlorophyll A To Identify Seabird Hotspots","Satellite imagery of chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) provides the only holistic perspective of productivity in marine ecosystems worldwide, yet its utility for understanding and predicting the distribution of upper trophic-level predators remains equivocal. We tested the hypothesis that remotely sensed chl a measurements spanning a decade can predict marine bird movements and distributions and provide insight into persistent seabird 'hotspots'. To test this hypothesis, we developed a temporally and spatially explicit chl a variance metric that explained up to twice the variation (90\%) in seabird distributions than mean chl a values in our model system, the California Current. Our chl a variance metric-the frequency of chlorophyll peaks index (FCPI) - quantifies the frequency of chl a anomalies that exceed 1 standard deviation from the mean, relative to a spatial model for the ecosystem. Using the FCPI, we identified locations of high chl a anomaly persistence amidst considerable habitat heterogeneity from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico. Calculating variance and persistence metrics such as FCPI over large temporal scales may be preferable to analyzing mean or median chl a values over shorter time scales if understanding or predicting predator distributions is a goal of the research. As a static habitat layer, we suggest that the FCPI integrates time lags, physical forcings, and food web processes that can thwart attempts to link primary productivity and predator distributions in pelagic ecosystems. Additionally, identifying important ecological areas reflecting persistently elevated productivity and predator abundance is critical to marine spatial management and conservation.","{""Santora, Jarrod A."",""Suryan, Robert M."",""Sydeman, William J.""}","10.3354/meps09597",2024-10-03 17:31:14,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",2012,"{}","{""Biological aggregations; Blooms; Marine protected areas; Persistence; Trophic transfer""}"

Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630.

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model in producing a remote sensing-based and detailed map of montado canopy density over a large territory in southern Portugal. This map will make a fundamental contribution to accurately identifying and assessing High Nature Value farmland in montado areas. The results reveal that the FCD model is an effective approach to estimating the density classes of montado canopy (overall accuracy = 78.0 \%, kappa value = 0.71). The study also shows that the FCD approach generated good user's and producer's accuracies for the three montado canopy-density classes. Globally, the results obtained show that biophysical indices such as the advanced vegetation index, the bare soil index, the shadow index and the thermal index are suitable for estimating and mapping montado canopy-density classes. These results constitute the first remote sensing-based product for mapping montado canopy density that has been developed using the FCD model.

6903606,"Local Drivers Of Anthropogenic Climate Change: Quantifying The Impact Through A Remote Sensing Approach In Brisbane","Urban expansions to adjoining greenfield sites, particularly in metropolitan regions, have become a global occurrence. Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured. The study utilizes a remote sensing approach to investigate the impacts of a period of over 30 years (1989-2019) in Brisbane, Australia and its adjoining local government areas. The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.",NA,"10.3390/rs12142270",2024-09-27 18:50:49,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863385,"Conflicts Of Interest And Emissions From Land Conversions: State Of New Jersey As A Case Study","Conflicts of interest (COI) are an integral part of human society, including their influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Individuals or entities often have multiple interests ranging from financial benefits to reducing climate change-related risks, where choosing one interest may negatively impact other interests and societal welfare. These types of COI require specific management strategies. This study examines COI from land-use decisions as an intersection of different perspectives on land use (e.g., land conservation versus land development), which can have various consequences regarding GHG emissions. This study uses the state of New Jersey (NJ) in the United States of America (USA) as a case study to demonstrate COI related to soil-based GHG emissions from land conversions between 2001 and 2016 which caused $722.2M (where M = million = 106) worth of “realized” social costs of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) emissions. These emissions are currently not accounted for in NJ’s total carbon footprint (CF), which can negatively impact the state’s ability to reach its carbon reduction goals. The state of NJ Statutes Annotated 26:2C-37 (2007): Global Warming Response Act (GWRA) (updated in 2019) set a statewide goal of reducing GHG emissions to 80 percent below 2006 levels by 2050. Remote sensing and soil data analysis allow temporal and quantitative assessment of the contribution of land cover conversions to NJ’s CF by soil carbon type, soil type, land cover type, and administrative units (state, counties), which helps document past, and estimate future related GHG emissions using a land cover change scenario to calculate the amount of GHG emissions if an area of land was to be developed. Decisions related to future land conversions involve potential COI within and outside state administrative structures, which could be managed by a conflict-of-interest policy. The site and time-specific disclosures of GHG emissions from land conversions can help governments manage these COI to mitigate climate change impacts and costs by assigning financial responsibility for specific CF contributions. Projected sea-level rise will impact 16 out of 21 NJ’s counties and it will likely reach coastal areas with densely populated urban areas throughout NJ. Low proportion of available public land limits opportunities for relocation. Increased climate-change-related damages in NJ and elsewhere will increase the number of climate litigation cases to alleviate costs associated with climate change. This litigation will further highlight the importance and intensity of different COI. © 2022 by the authors.","{""Hao, Z."",""Lin, L."",""Mikhailova, E. A."",""Post, C. J."",""Post, G.

However, due to data and model limitations, obtaining high-quality, high-spatial-resolution surface PM2.5 concentration data is a challenging task, and it is difficult to accurately assess the temporal and spatial changes in PM2.5 levels at a small regional scale. Here, we combined multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol products, ERA5 reanalysis data, etc., to construct an STW-LightGBM model that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution and estimate the PM2.5 concentration of China's surface at 1 km resolution from 2015 to 2020. Our model performed well, and the fitting accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validation between years was 0.877-0.917. The fitting accuracy of the model was >0.85 at different time scales (month, season, and year). The average slope of the regression prediction was 0.9 annually. The results showed that PM2.5 pollution improved from 2015 to 2020. The average PM2.5 concentration decreased by 4.55 mu g/m(3), and the maximum decrease reached 90.51 mu g/m(3). The areas with high PM2.5 concentrations were predominantly in the North China Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Xinjiang in the west, and the levels in areas with elevated PM2.5 levels were consistent across most study years. The standard deviation ellipse for PM2.5 in China showed a 'northeast-southwest' spatial distribution. From an interannual perspective, the average values of the four seasonal stations in the country showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2020, with the most obvious decline in winter, from 70.67 mu g/m(3) in 2015 to 46.75 mu g/m(3) in 2020.

The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R-2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R-2>0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD similar to 0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years.",NA,"10.3390/rs12162652",2024-09-26 01:06:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{validation}",NA

6863117,"Optimization Of Soil Background Removal To Improve The Prediction Of Wheat Traits With Uav Imagery","Grain yield and quality assessment based on remote sensing throughout the growth cycle may contribute to achieve efficient and sustainable wheat production. A trial was conducted to test the suitability of a multispectral sensor onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate yield, protein content, and nitrogen (N) output in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Furthermore, a method to improve predictions of wheat traits was proposed by sequentially removing soil pixels from the distribution of vegetation index (VI) values. The experimental area, located at Aranjuez (Madrid, Spain), was divided into four sectors with 133 plots in total. Different N doses were applied to the plots to create high experimental intravariability. In each plot, wheat traits were measured at harvest. An (UAV) was flown at growth stages (GS) – GS32, GS39, and GS65 – to ensure correct monitoring of the crop. Four VIs, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) and Blue-Red Index (BRI1) were selected based on the sensor spectral information and their suitability for estimating wheat traits. A sequential cutting method (threshold value optimization, TVO) was implemented to remove soil background pixels, based on threshold values computed from the VIs distributions. Then, the predictive performance of the VIs in each segmentation was evaluated. Our results indicated that NDVI, MSAVI, and NDRE were able to predict the wheat traits using sensors onboard a UAV. We proposed optimal thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 depending on the VI and the wheat trait. The TVO method showed an improvement in yield and N output estimation at the stem elongation growth stage (GS32). However, the TVO method achieved a limited improvement in estimating protein content at anthesis (GS65). Overall, our results suggest (a) that soil background reflectance is an essential element of UAV imagery that introduces uncertainty in the estimation of grain yield and quality based on VIs, and (b) that TVO may mitigate the soil effect. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","{""Almeida-Ñauñay, A.

By assessing the landscape ecological risk of the Huaihe River ecological and economic zone, it can promote the development of ecological risk assessment theory, provide a scientific basis for the formulation of ecological civilization construction planning and policies, and help to strengthen environmental monitoring, planning and management, and promote the construction of ecological civilization. Based on the remote sensing image data of land use from 1985 to 2020, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of land use and LER in the Anhui section of the Huaihe River Ecological and Economic Belt in China were explored. The results showed that: (1) The construction land showed an increasing trend, with an increased area of 4753.35 km2, whereas the cultivated land showed a negative growth trend, with a reduced area of 4487.58 km2. (2) During the past 35 years, the ecological risks in the research area showed a decreasing trend as a whole, with medium-low and medium-risk areas ranking as the main; medium-high and high-risk areas are mainly distributed on both sides of the Huaihe River and in the northern-central part of Suzhou City. (3) Moran's I values of LER in each period were showing significant spatial autocorrelation and tending to converge spatially. In the future, the ecological security pattern should be optimized for local high-risk deterioration areas.","{""Chen, Yuanyuan"",""Ou, Chun"",""Qi, Huimin"",""Sheng, Yutian"",""Yao, Xiamei"",""Yuan, Tingting"",""Zhang, Qingyi""}","10.1080/10807039.2023.2289106",2024-07-18 20:49:00,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Land use"",""economic belt"",""land cover (LULC); landscape ecological risk (LER); spatial autocorrelation; Huaihe River ecological""}"

6862972,"Distribution Of Volatile Organic Compounds Over Indian Subcontinent During Winter: Wrf-Chem Simulation Versus Observations","We investigate the distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)over Indian subcontinent during a winter month of January 2011 combining the regional model WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry)with ground- and space-based observations and chemical reanalysis. WRF-Chem simulated VOCs are found to be comparable with ground-based observations over contrasting environments of the Indian subcontinent. WRF-Chem results reveal the elevated levels of VOCs (e. g. propane)over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (16 ppbv), followed by the Northeast region (9.1 ppbv)in comparison with other parts of the Indian subcontinent (1.3–8.2 ppbv). Higher relative abundances of propane (27–31%)and ethane (13–17%)are simulated across the Indian subcontinent. WRF-Chem simulated formaldehyde and glyoxal show the western coast, Eastern India and the Indo-Gangetic Plain as the regional hotspots, in a qualitative agreement with the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate)reanalysis and satellite-based observations. Lower values of RGF (ratio of glyoxal to formaldehyde <0.04)suggest dominant influences of the anthropogenic emissions on the distribution of VOCs over Indian subcontinent, except the northeastern region where higher RGF (∼0.06)indicates the role of biogenic emissions, in addition to anthropogenic emissions. Analysis of HCHO/NO2 ratio shows a NOx-limited ozone production over India, with a NOx-to-VOC transition regime over central India and IGP. The study highlights a need to initiate in situ observations of VOCs over regional hotspots (Northeast, Central India, and the western coast)based on WRF-Chem results, where different satellite-based observations differ significantly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","{""Alvarado, L.

6863310,"Assessment Of Desertification In Eritrea: Land Degradation Based On Landsat Images","Remote sensing is an effective way in monitoring desertification dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, we used a decision tree method based on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SAVI (soil adjusted vegetation index), and vegetation cover proportion to quantify and analyze the desertification in Eritrea using Landsat data of the 1970s, 1980s and 2014. The results demonstrate that the NDVI value and the annual mean precipitation declined while the temperature increased over the past 40 a. Strongly desertified land increased from 4.82×104 km2 (38.5%) in the 1970s to 8.38×104 km2 (66.9%) in 2014: approximately 85% of the land of the country was under serious desertification, which significantly occurred in arid and semi-arid lowlands of the country (eastern, northern, and western lowlands) with relatively scarce precipitation and high temperature. The non-desertified area, mostly located in the sub-humid eastern escarpment, also declined from approximately 2.1% to 0.5%. The study concludes that the desertification is a cause of serious land degradation in Eritrea and may link to climate changes, such as low and unpredictable precipitation, and prolonged drought. © 2019, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","{""Ghebrezgabher, M.

6903659,"Analysis Of Extreme Rainfall And Natural Disasters Events Using Satellite Precipitation Products In Different Regions Of Brazil","The number of natural disasters triggered by extreme events is increasing worldwide and significantly impacts modern society. Extreme rainfall is one of the most important factors contributing to these events. A better understanding of the physical process that causes extreme rainfall can allow rapid responses from decision-makers to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the local population. Satellite monitoring is widely used for this purpose and is essential for regions where terrestrial observations are limited or non-existent. The primary purpose of this study is to describe the performance of satellite products for extreme rainfall events that caused natural disasters in various climate regimes in Brazil and discuss the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) to these events. We defined regions based on the climatological rainfall distribution. Cases with rain values above the 99th percentile during 2012-2016 were considered statistically extreme. Our analysis is based on three datasets, with precipitation from (i) rain gauge stations, (ii) different satellite-based estimates, and (iii) mesoscale convective tracking data. The methodology was based on identifying extreme rainfall events, analyzing the performance of satellite precipitation estimates and, finally, quantifying the influence of convective systems on extreme rain. Although all regions of Brazil may be affected by natural disasters caused by extreme rains, the results suggest that the impacts caused in each region are different in magnitude. Convective systems explained over 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in Brazil's south and about 60\% to 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in the Northeast. In general, satellite products have identified rain events; however, in the southern region of Brazil, products have tended to overestimate rainfall, while other regions have tended to underestimate extreme rain values. The methods used in satellite precipitation estimation products have limitations to accurately identifying specific extreme rain events.",NA,"10.3390/atmos13101680",2024-09-27 22:24:08,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6691626,"Economic benefit of meteorology in the Swiss road transportation sector","Meteorological services involve the provision of information on the state of the atmosphere and the ground surface. They provide data, information, forecasts and various related products, which are important for the smooth functioning of many aspects of the economy, government and society. The economic value or benefit of weather forecasts consists in generally improving financial and related outcomes resulting from the use of such forecasts. The merit of meteorological services cannot directly be deduced from the consumption of services. Rather, it emerges from the improvement of decisions made by economic stakeholders thanks to weather-related information. This is the first empirical study on this topic for Switzerland which includes economic data from interviewed users. The results show that the use of meteorology in the road transportation sector in Switzerland generates an economic benefit to the national economy of 65.7–79.77 million Swiss francs (1 Swiss franc ∼0.90 €, 1.20 US$ as of August 2011). In relation to its budget the overall benefit to the national meteorological service might be several times that amount, considering that many other economic sectors such as agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, media and tourism were not included in this study. Furthermore, climate services were not taken into account in this study and, therefore, the economic benefit for the road traffic sector alone might in fact be even higher.","{""Frei, Thomas""}","Economic benefit of meteorology in the Swiss road transportation sector",2024-04-26 18:52:27,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2014,"{}","{""meteorological information|weather service|road traffic|economic stakeholders|cost-benefit analysis""}"

We are unaware of studies that have described the evolution of patient-driven innovations from the Nightscout Project to date. Methods: We identified patient-driven, DIY innovations from posts and comments in the “CGM in the Cloud” private Facebook group as well as data from Twitter, GitHub, and the Nightscout website. For each innovation, we described its intent or its unaddressed need as well as the associated features and improvements. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify overarching patterns among the innovations, features, and improvements, and compared the timeline of innovations in the DIY space with the timing of similar innovations in the commercial space. Results: We identified and categorized innovations in Nightscout with the most commonly appearing themes of: visualization improvements, equipment improvements, and user experience improvements. Other emerging themes included: Care Portal support, safety, remote monitoring, decision support, international support, artificial pancreas, pushover notifications, and open-source collaboration. Conclusions: This rapid development of patient-designed DIY innovations driven by unmet needs in the type 1 diabetes community reflects a revolutionary, bottom–up approach to medical innovation.

6863032,"Air Pollution Mortality Benefits Of Sustained Covid-19 Mobility Restrictions In Australian Cities","Objectives: Emissions from road traffic, power generation and industry were substantially reduced during pandemic lockdown periods globally. Thus, we analysed reductions in traffic-related air pollution in Australian capital cities during March-April 2020 and then modelled the mortality benefits that could be realised if similar reductions were sustained by structural policy interventions.Study design: Satellite, air pollution monitor and land use observations were used to estimate ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in all Australian capital cities during: (a) a typical year with no prolonged air pollution events; (b) a hypothetical sustained reduction in NO2 equivalent to the COVID-19 lockdowns.Methods: We use the WHO recommended NO2 exposure-response coefficient for mortality (1.023, 95 \% CI: 1.008-1.037, per 10 mg/m3 annual average) to assess gains in life expectancy and population-wide years of life from reduced exposure to traffic-related air pollution.Results: We attribute 1.1 \% of deaths to anthropogenic NO2 exposures in Australian cities, corresponding to a total of 13,340 years of life lost annually. Although COVID-19-related reductions in NO2 varied widely between Australian cities during April 2020, equivalent and sustained reductions in NO2 emissions could reduce NO2-attributable deaths by 27 \%, resulting in 3348 years of life gained annually.Conclusions: COVID-19 mobility restrictions reduced NO2 emissions and population-wide exposures in Australian cities. When sustained to the same extent by policy interventions that reduce fossil fuel consumption by favouring the uptake of electric vehicles, active travel and public transport, the health, mortality and economic benefits will be measurable in Australian cities.(c) 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health.

6903638,"The Utility Of Random Forests For Wildfire Severity Mapping","Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95\%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74\%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6\%-21\%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55\%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.",NA,"10.1016/j.rse.2018.07.005",2024-09-27 22:20:57,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",NA,"{""values algorithm""}",NA

The coordinated development of ecology and economy is a major theoretical and practical problem for the Qinba Mountains, which is once one of the 14 contiguous destitute areas in China. Based on the land use and cover change (LUCC) data interpreted by medium-resolution remote sensing images, this study adopted the modified equivalent factor method to calculate ecosystem service value (ESV) and its temporal and spatial variation in the Qinba Mountains. A comprehensive index system was constructed to measure the socioeconomic development level and to reveal the coupling relationship between the ESV and socioeconomic development. The results show that: (1) for 2000-2015, the ESV in these areas was increasing, the proportion of forest ESV was the largest, and it increased significantly. (2) The level of socioeconomic development was constantly improving, and the differences within the region were gradually emerging. (3) Except for the Hantai District, which has been in a highly uncoordinated state, the degree of coordination between ESV and socioeconomic development has improved year by year, and most counties were in a state of medium coordination, or above. The results contribute to a scientific basis for decision making regarding ecological environmental protection and green economic development in the Qinba Mountains, and have positive significance for promoting the construction of ecological civilization and sustainable development in the study area.","{""Liu, Jiechao"",""Ma, Qi"",""Xi, Meijun"",""Zhao, Jing"",""Zhou, Mengquan""}","10.3390/d14121105",2024-07-15 16:16:26,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""ecosystem service value (ESV); socioeconomic development; coupling coordination degree; entropy weig""}"

6903576,"Improving Spatial Resolution Of Grace-Derived Water Storage Changes Based On Geographically Weighted Regression Downscaled Model","Obtaining high-resolution products that can accurately estimate the spatiotemporal changes in regional water resources is essential for the rational utilization of water resources. The temporal gravity field model derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite can effectively monitor the regional terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes. Nevertheless, the main of GRACE products is their coarse spatial resolution, which limits their applicability to small-scale regions. Herein, we propose a geographically weighted regression downscaled model (GWRDM) to improve the spatial resolution of TWS from 0.5 degrees to 0.1 degrees and validate it against the downscaled results provided by the spatial global regression downscaled model (SGRDM) and temporal grid regression downscaled model (TGRDM). The results show that the downscaled products based on GWRDM outperform those based on SGRDM and TGRDM. The GWRDM not only effectively improves the spatial resolution of GRACE products but also maintains the intensity of the original signal. Similarly, the GWRDM is further used to downscale groundwater storage (GWS) and validated against the in situ observations. The downscaled GWS based on GWRDM agrees well with in situ observations. On the monthly scale, the average correlation coefficient (CC) for both is 0.53 and above 0.70 for some in situ observations. On the annual scale, 81.25\% and 37.50\% of the in situ observations have CC values larger than 0.60 and 0.90, respectively, which further verifies the reliability of GWRDM. Consequently, the GWRDM provides a practical algorithm for obtaining high-resolution water storage estimates, which is expected to provide a reference for small-scale regional water resources management.",NA,"10.1109/jstars.2023.3272916",2024-09-30 21:30:10,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863580,"People, Pollution And Pathogens – Global Change Impacts In Mountain Freshwater Ecosystems","Mountain catchments provide for the livelihood of more than half of humankind, and have become a key destination for tourist and recreation activities globally. Mountain ecosystems are generally considered to be less complex and less species diverse due to the harsh environmental conditions. As such, they are also more sensitive to the various impacts of the Anthropocene. For this reason, mountain regions may serve as sentinels of change and provide ideal ecosystems for studying climate and global change impacts on biodiversity. We here review different facets of anthropogenic impacts on mountain freshwater ecosystems. We put particular focus on micropollutants and their distribution and redistribution due to hydrological extremes, their direct influence on water quality and their indirect influence on ecosystem health via changes of freshwater species and their interactions. We show that those changes may drive pathogen establishment in new environments with harmful consequences for freshwater species, but also for the human population. Based on the reviewed literature, we recommend reconstructing the recent past of anthropogenic impact through sediment analyses, to focus efforts on small, but highly productive waterbodies, and to collect data on the occurrence and variability of microorganisms, biofilms, plankton species and key species, such as amphibians due to their bioindicator value for ecosystem health and water quality.

6862844,"Forest-Scale Phenotyping: Productivity Characterisation Through Machine Learning","Advances in remote sensing combined with the emergence of sophisticated methods for large-scale data analytics from the field of data science provide new methods to model complex interactions in biological systems. Using a data-driven philosophy, insights from experts are used to corroborate the results generated through analytical models instead of leading the model design. Following such an approach, this study outlines the development and implementation of a whole-of-forest phenotyping system that incorporates spatial estimates of productivity across a large plantation forest. In large-scale plantation forestry, improving the productivity and consistency of future forests is an important but challenging goal due to the multiple interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, the long breeding cycle, and the high variability of growing conditions. Forest phenotypic expression is highly affected by the interaction of environmental conditions and forest management but the understanding of this complex dynamics is incomplete. In this study, we collected an extensive set of 2.7 million observations composed of 62 variables describing climate, forest management, tree genetics, and fine-scale terrain information extracted from environmental surfaces, management records, and remotely sensed data. Using three machine learning methods, we compared models of forest productivity and evaluate the gain and Shapley values for interpreting the influence of categorical variables on the power of these methods to predict forest productivity at a landscape level. The most accurate model identified that the most important drivers of productivity were, in order of importance, genetics, environmental conditions, leaf area index, topology, and soil properties, thus describing the complex interactions of the forest. This approach demonstrates that new methods in remote sensing and data science enable powerful, landscape-level understanding of forest productivity. The phenotyping method developed here can be used to identify superior and inferior genotypes and estimate a productivity index for individual site. This approach can improve tree breeding and deployment of the right genetics to the right site in order to increase the overall productivity across planted forests.","{""Bombrun, Maxime"",""Dash, Jonathan P."",""Dungey, Heidi S."",""Pearse, Grant D."",""Pont, David"",""Watt, Michael S.""}","10.3389/fpls.2020.00099",2024-07-17 18:04:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""gradient boosting; decision trees; GPU-acceleration; LIDAR; forestry; phenotyping""}"
6903650,"Integrated Concepts In Water Reuse: Managing Global Water Needs","Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater, and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation, recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies. The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous. Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water, co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including: the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel applications; the need for public education and increased public acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians. Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting water reuse globally.

6863455,"Holidays In Lights: Tracking Cultural Patterns In Demand For Energy Services","Successful climate change mitigation will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors have been described as a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro-level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the sociocultural setting within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high-quality Suomi-NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price-based incentives and societal-level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales. Our initial results demonstrate the importance of seating energy demand frameworks in a social context.","{""Roman, Miguel O."",""Stokes, Eleanor C.""}","10.1002/2014ef000285",2024-07-15 23:01:37,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}","{""Energy Use; Climate Change Mitigation; Human Dimensions; Remote Sensing""}"

6903663,"Potential Ecosystem Service Values Of Mangrove Forests In Southeastern China Using High-Resolution Satellite Data","Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US\$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US\$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US\$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23\% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US\$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78\% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33\% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US\$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US\$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers.",NA,"10.1016/j.ecss.2018.05.023",2024-09-26 00:55:41,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6903624,"Network Analysis Of Sea Turtle Movements And Connectivity: A Tool For Conservation Prioritization","Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of animal movements is a critical element in conserving long-lived, highly mobile marine species. Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts. Location Global. Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections. Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links. Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.",NA,"10.1111/ddi.13485",2024-09-27 22:29:24,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

Future 'Environmental Data Scientists' will need to draw on multiple data and information sources, using data analysis, statistics and models to create knowledge that is communicated effectively to decision-makers in government, industry, and civil society. Networks, cloud computing and visualization will become increasingly important as citizen scientists, data journalists and politicians increasingly use Earth observation products to give their arguments and decisions scientific credibility. The overarching aim of Earth Observation education must therefore be to support life-long learning, allowing users at all levels to remain up-to-date with EO technologies and communication mechanisms that are relevant to their individual needs. Current and emerging methodologies for interactive education (such as ""MOOCs"" and mobile learning), and hands-on engagement with real data (such as through citizen science projects) will be central to outreach, training and formal education in this field. To achieve this, it will be important to engage a wider community of experts from a range of disciplines, and to establish a comprehensive network of educators, technical experts, and content producers. It will also be important to encourage ""crowd-sourcing"" of new contributions, to help maintain scientific and educational quality.

6903495,"Sand Dams For Sustainable Water Management: Challenges And Future Opportunities","Sand dams are impermeable water harvesting structures built to collect and store water within the volume of sediments transported by ephemeral rivers. The artificial sandy aquifer created by the sand damreduces evaporation losses relative to surface water storage in traditional dams. Recent years have seen a renaissance of studies on sand dams as an effective water scarcity adaptation strategy for drylands. However, many aspects of their functioning and effectiveness are still unclear. Literature reviews have pointed to a range of research gaps that need further scientific attention, such as river corridors and network dynamics, watershed-scale impacts, and interaction with social dynamics. However, the scattered and partially incomplete information across the different reviews would benefit froman integrated framework for directing future research efforts. This paper is a collaborative effort of different research groups active on sand dams and stems from the need to channel future research efforts on this topic in a thorough and coherent way. We synthesize the pivotal research gaps of a) unclear definition of ""functioning"" sand dams, b) lack of methodologies for watershed-scale analysis, c) neglect of social aspects in sand dam research, and d) underreported impacts of sand dams. We then propose framing future research to better target the synthesized gaps, including using the socialecological systems framework to better capture the interconnected social and biophysical research gaps on sand dams, fully utilizing the potential of remote sensing in large-scale studies and collecting sand dam cases across the world to create an extensive database to advance evidence-based research on sand dams.",NA,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156126",2024-09-27 23:03:06,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863393,"Anthropic Effects On The Geomorphology And Morphodynamics Of The Coastal Zone Of La Paz Lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico","The aridity and geographic isolation of the region currently occupied by the State of Baja California Sur have determined its status as a sparsely populated region for most of its history, which has allowed the ecosystems therein to remain pristine or little impacted. Nevertheless, the State has not been immune to the global trend of vigorous population growth in coastal regions. This trend became evident in La Paz city since the 1990s (population as of 1995: 158,800; as of 2015: 253,021 inhabitants), caused by a tourism-driven economy that has led to accelerated, unplanned urban sprawling (urban area as of 1995: 44.7 km2; as of 2017: 85.7 km2). The objective of this study was to identify and analyze anthropic effects on the geomorphology and morphodynamics of the coastal zone, starting with the geomorphological reconstruction of the likely original conditions, followed by an analysis of the population growth and economic activities leading to urban expansion, to finally elucidating their effects on and the evolutionary response of the coastal zone. We used linear regression methods for analyzing geomorphological and morphodynamic changes from historical documents, particularly those that are, or can be, georeferenced such as maps, aerial photographs, and satellite images. This allows utilizing both methods over long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales. Linear regression methods used all the shoreline location data points available to identify changes over time and estimate evolutionary rates. One distinctive advantage of linear regressions is the possibility of using coastlines as delineated from aerial photographs or historical maps, since beach profiles encompassing long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales are usually not available. The study area comprises two distinct geomorphological units - the alluvial plain and the coastal zone - subject to increasing anthropic activity as evidenced by urban expansion over time. This affects the geomorphological environment, causing major changes in the physical environment, such as fragmentation in parcels and streets, deforestation, and land leveling, as well as the diversion and filling of streambeds. The direct effects of anthropogenic activities on the coastal zone lead to the alteration and partial or total loss of coastal ecosystems such as coastal plains, marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, caused by the construction of tourism infrastructure including hotels, marinas, docks, golf courses, and buildings ranging from residential areas to car junkyards. At the same time, the effects of human activities on the alluvial plain indirectly impact the coastal zone through the reduction of the effective runoff area caused by unabated urban expansion. This, in turn, impairs the sedimentary balance that gave rise to alluvial coastal environments, in which the intensity of the dynamic agents (such as wind, tides, and waves) acting on the coastal zone remained constant. These agents have been acting with the same intensity but, in the absence of sedimentary material, conditions have changed sufficiently to affect the morphodynamics of the coastal fringe of the La Paz lagoon. The evolutionary trend of the La Paz lagoon shows that it has experienced an erosive process at a rate of 0.00227 km2 over 44 years (from 1973 to 2017, or 0.3 m/ year). Paradoxically, the poor or nil urban growth planning is not only causing the loss of the resources that support tourism activities, but is also exacerbating the vulnerability to flooding events in La Paz city and surrounding suburbs. Therefore, it is crucial to properly weigh the benefits of continuing building hotels, marinas, golf courses, residential areas, and other types of infrastructure, versus those of conserving marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, whose proper use and management would contribute to the sustainable economic and environmental development of the region. © 2020 Instituto de Geografia.

An integrated approach combining the geospatial techniques and multi-influencing factors (MIF) was adapted for the determination of potential groundwater zone in the Purulia District of West Bengal, Eastern India. The present groundwater is underexploited for agricultural and other activities. This study would also benefit in identifying the artificial recharge zone for further research and developmental activity in the region. The important parameters including slope, landuse/cover, lineament, drainage, geology, and soil affecting potential groundwater occurrence were generated from Topo Maps, Landsat remote sensing imagery, and various ancillary data. Various thematic layers were allocated a fixed score as weightage using MIF technique. Thereafter, the weighted layers were statistically computed in the overlay analysis to generate the groundwater prospect map. The groundwater potential map demonstrated five zones, viz. very good (13.8\%), good (34.9\%), moderate (48.3\%), poor (2.8\%), and very poor (0.2\%).

6862906,"Estimation Of Surface Water Runoff For A Semi-Arid Area Using Rs And Gis-Based Scs-Cn Method","The proper planning of storage structures, waterways, irrigation schemes, water harvesting, erosion control structures, and groundwater development strategies requires accurate estimation of surface runoff. However, hydrologists in Saudi Arabia face serious challenges, specifically due to the rare availability of surface runoff data. In this study, the soil conservation service-curve number (SCS-CN) method integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) was utilized to estimate the surface runoff in Wadi-Uranah basin, in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Different thematic maps such as slope, hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use/land cover (LULC), and daily rainfall have been created in GIS environment and processed to generate the curve number (CN) and surface runoff maps. Based on the soil classification results, the study area was categorized into two HSGs (B and C). The dominant HSG was group C, representing about 98.8\% of the total area. The LULC analysis showed four main land use types in the study region: urban, rocks, barren soil, and agricultural areas. Furthermore, the finding results showed that CN values for the normal conditions (CNII) ranged between 74 and 93 in agricultural and both urban and rock areas, respectively. The CN(II)values were further corrected using slope data to derive slope-adjusted CNII. Moreover, the rainfall-runoff results showed an increase in the daily runoff of the study region with a minimum of 15 mm to a maximum of 74 mm. Another interesting result was rainfall-runoff linear regression analysis that showed a good correlation of 0.98. Additionally, the peak runoff hydrograph flows for 10-, 50-, and 100-year return periods obtained from the SCS-based dimensionless unit hydrograph were 828, 1353, and 1603 m(3)/s, respectively. Therefore, this study highlights that the SCS-CN method integrated with RS and GIS deserves further attention for estimating runoff of ungauged basins for better basins management and conservation purposes.","{""Al-Ghobari, Hussein"",""Alataway, Abed"",""Dewidar, Ahmed""}","10.3390/w12071924",2024-07-19 18:18:33,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""GIS; rainfall-runoff; remote sensing; SCS-CN""}"
6903657,"Limited Reciprocal Surrogacy Of Bird And Habitat Diversity And Inconsistencies In Their Representation In Romanian Protected Areas","Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found a limited reciprocal surrogacy performance, with bird species performing slightly better as a conservation surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. We could also show that areas with a high conservation value based on habitat diversity were represented better in already existing protected areas than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0251950",2024-09-26 00:56:27,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

Objectives seek to improve the likelihood of successful SOS formation and pursue constituent system utility robustness. The proposed metaheuristic optimization trade-space exploration method accounts for technical and economic design variables and multi-decision-maker strategy dynamics. Constituent system designs are ranked on their simulated net present value. A game-theoretic measure of risk dominance is used in concert with the net present value to assess the robustness and utility of candidate SOS designs. The method is validated with a notional application case that assesses potential collaboration between Earth-observing and telecommunications systems. The proposed methodology reduces the threshold probability of partner collaboration for which SOS participation is economically rational by up to 18\% for the most efficient designs as compared to a typical conceptual design method, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful SOS formation.

GEOEssential is following an end-user driven approach by defining Essential Variables (EVs), as an intermediate value between environmental policy indicators and their appropriate data sources. From international to local scales, environmental policies and indicators are increasingly percolating down from the global to the local agendas. The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows. To interpret and present the relevant outputs/results carried out by the different thematic workflows considered in GEOEssential (i.e. biodiversity, ecosystems, extractives, night light, and food-water-energy nexus), a Dashboard is built as a visual front-end. This is a valuable instrument to track progresses towards environmental policies.","{""Lehmann, Anthony""}","https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2019.1585977",2024-04-25 02:20:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""SDGs|environmental policies|essential variables|earth observation|knowledge base|workflows|virtual r""}"
6903512,"Analysis Of Epidemic Characteristics And Related Factors Of Norovirus In Diarrhea Patients In Guangxi, 2015-2020","Objective To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and related factors of norovirus in Guangxi from 2015 to 2020, and to provide scientific recommendations for norovirus prevention and control. Methods The foodborne diseases surveillance data were collected from 11 sentinel hospitals through the National Foodborne Disease Monitoring and Reporting System from 2015 to 2020. R software with version 4.0.3 was used for descriptive and statistical analysis, including epidemic curve, chi-square test, and trend chi-square and so on. Logistic regression was used to analyze norovirus-related factors, OR values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated respectively with the statistical test level of P<0.05. Results There were 1 008 norovirus cases detected, with a detection rate of 12.75% (1 008/7 903). Children with age less than 5 years (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.13-1.82) and patients at age 20-45 (OR=1.45, 95%CI: 1.13-1.87) were high risk population. The detection rate was higher in autumn (OR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.08-1.53) but lower in summer (OR=0.67, 95%CI: 0.55-0.80). In addition, the tourist area (Guilin City) presented a higher detection rate than other areas (OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.80). Aquatic products (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.03-1.91), meat and dairy products (OR=1.31, 95%CI: 1.06-1.61) were high-risk foods for norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can reduce the possibility of norovirus by 61% (OR= 0.39, 95%CI: 0.31-0.49) showed a declining trend (Trend χ2=85.33, P<0.001). In addition, prolonged visit time can lead to 19%-23% decrease in the detection rate of norovirus (OR24-48 hours=0.81, 95%CI: 0.70-0.95; OR>48 hours=0.77, 95%CI: 0.63-0.93). Conclusions The epidemic of norovirus presented seasonal and regional distribution in Guangxi with a declining detection rate trend in diarrhea patients during recent 6 years. Young children were high-risk population in infection norovirus. The intake of seafood can increase the risk of norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can sharply decrease the possibility of infection norovirus. The monitoring of key foods such as seafood should be strengthened, and the early screening of suspected cases should be taken. The norovirus monitoring should be improved to ensure the health of the population. © 2023 The authors.",NA,"10.13604/j.cnki.46-1064/r.2023.02.08",2024-10-03 22:05:43,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{""sentinel hospitals"",spurious}",NA
6863000,"Assessment Of Landcover Impacts On The Groundwater Quality Using Hydrogeochemical And Geospatial Techniques","Groundwater quality is influenced by urbanization and land use land cover (LULC) changes. This study investigated their impact on groundwater quality in Quetta City, Pakistan, from 2015 to 2021. About 58 groundwater samples from monitoring wells were analyzed using hydrogeochemical and statistical methods. The water quality index (WQI), Wilcox, USSL, and various agricultural indices were employed to assess water quality trends. LULC analysis and NDVI using Sentinel-2 imagery revealed increased urban and agricultural areas and decreased barren land. Rapid urbanization was evident, with the buildup class expanding by 7.50\% during this period. NDVI findings emphasized monitoring vegetation health and water quality for environmental assessments. The groundwater in Quetta was primarily classified as Cl-Ca center dot Mg, Cl-Ca, and Cl-Na according to the Piper diagram, with water-rock interactions and rock weathering evident. Most groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation according to the Wilcox and USSL diagrams. The WQI demonstrated overall safety for human consumption, but declining WQI values in northern parts due to urbanization are concerning. The results also revealed a moderate positive relationship between landcover classes and WQI values. It can be concluded that urbanization and excessive use of pesticides contributed to declining agricultural land quality. The spatial overlay of agricultural indices with landcover class suggested that barren land was most suitable, followed by build-up and agriculture were suitable for drinking and agriculture purposes. Moreover, agricultural indices moderately declined due to excessive fertilizers and pesticides in the agriculture landcover class. Thus, effective water resource management is crucial to address challenges. This comprehensive study serves as a baseline for future research and recommends larger-scale studies to implement efficient management strategies, urbanization planning, and safe irrigation and drinking water practices to prevent groundwater pollution.","{""Amin, Gomal"",""Baloch, Muhammad Yousuf Jat"",""Haroon, Ehsan"",""Iqbal, Javed"",""Su, Chunli""}","10.1007/s11356-023-29628-w",2024-09-27 23:03:35,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2023,"{}","{""Hydrogeochemistry; Groundwater quality; Water-rock interaction; Land use/land cover; Wilcox; Sustain""}"
6903661,"Within-Field Nitrogen Response In Corn Related To Aerial Photograph Color","Precise management of nitrogen (N) using canopy color in aerial imagery of corn (Zea mays L.) has been proposed as a strategy on which to base the rate of N fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between canopy color and yield response to N at the field scale. Six N response trials were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in fields with alluvial, claypan and deep loess soil types. Aerial images were taken with a 35-mm slide film from a parts per thousand yen1100 m at the mid- and late-vegetative corn growth stages and processed to extract green and red digital values. Color values of the control N (0 kg N ha(-1)) and sufficient N (280 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting) treatments were used to calculate the relative ratio of unfertilized to fertilized and relative difference color values. Other N fertilizer treatments included side-dressed applications in increments of 56 kg N ha(-1). The economic optimal N rate was weakly related (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.34) or not related to the color indices at both growth stages. For many sites, delta yield (the increase in yield between control N and sufficient N treatments) was related to the color indices (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.67) at the late vegetative growth stage; the best relationship was with green relative difference. The results indicate the potential for color indices from aerial photographs to be used for predicting delta yield from which a site-specific N rate could be determined.",NA,"10.1007/s11119-009-9137-x",2024-10-03 22:06:39,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863662,"Overview Of Toxic Cyanobacteria And Cyanotoxins In Ibero-American Freshwaters: Challenges For Risk Management And Opportunities For Removal By Advanced Technologies","The increasing occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms worldwide represents an important threat for both the environment and public health. In this context, the development of risk analysis and management tools as well as sustainable and cost-effective treatment processes is essential. The research project TALGENTOX, funded by the Ibero-American Science and Technology Program for Development (CYTED-2019), aims to address this ambitious challenge in countries with different environmental and social conditions within the Ibero-American context. It is based on a multidisciplinary approach that combines ecology, water management and technology fields, and includes research groups from Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Spain. In this review, the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in freshwaters from these countries are summarized. The presence of cyanotoxins has been confirmed in all countries but the information is still scarce and further monitoring is required. In this regard, remote sensing or metagenomics are good alternatives at reasonable cost. The risk management of freshwaters from those countries considering the most frequent uses (consumption and recreation) has been also evaluated. Only Spain and Peru include cyanotoxins in its drinking water legislation (only MC-LR) and thus, there is a need for regulatory improvements. The development of preventive strategies like diminishing nutrient loads to aquatic systems is also required. In the same line, corrective measures are urgently needed especially in drinking waters. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have the potential to play a major role in this scenario as they are effective for the elimination of most cyanotoxins classes. The research on the field of AOPs is herein summarized considering the cost-effectiveness, environmental character and technical applicability of such technologies. Fenton-based processes and photocatalysis using solar irradiation or LED light represent very promising alternatives given their high cost-efficiency. Further research should focus on developing stable long-term operation systems, addressing their scale-up. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","{""Carmona-Jiménez, J."",""Caro-Borrero, A."",""Casas, J.

6863104,"Assessing Forest Health Using Remote Sensing-Based Indicators And Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process In Valmiki Tiger Reserve, India","Anthropogenic activities, climate variability and environmental stresses have greatly affected forest ecosystems globally. Thus, monitoring of forest health is essential for proper planning and effective management. The present study employed an integrated approach of remote sensing and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to assess the forest health in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in India. Advanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, forest fragmentation, rainfall and soil types were derived from remote sensing data. Multiple buffer zones of villages, roads, railways and canals were also determined for analyzing the forest health status. These layers were prepared in the geographical information system. These layers were given weightage using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. These layers were integrated to prepare forest health map using weighted overlay method. The results revealed that the largest forest area was found under moderately healthy forest (37\%) followed by healthy forest (31\%) and unhealthy forest (13\%). Of the total area of the Reserve, 19\% area was under non-forest category. Human-induced disturbances such as encroachment, illegal sand mining, livestock grazing and forest conversion to agriculture have been attributed to the unhealthy forest in the Reserve. The receiver operating characteristic curve value and area under curve (0.792) show reliability of forest health map. The findings of this study may be helpful for forest managers, conservationists and local communities in devising sustainable strategies for effective management of the forest. The methodological framework adopted in this study may be utilized in other geographical regions interested in assessing forest health.","{""Ahmed, R."",""Masroor, M."",""Rahaman, M.

6862874,"Satellite-Based Streamflow Simulation Using Chirps Satellite Precipitation Product In Shah Bahram Basin, Iran","Precipitation is the most important climate variable in hydrological practices, so accurate estimation of its intensity and volume is very crucial for hydrological applications. Remote sensing precipitation estimations have recently been widely employed in water resources management due to the lack of observed precipitation measurements in remote areas. However, remote sensing precipitation estimations are not free from systematic errors. This study aims to bias-correct the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) satellite precipitation estimations using the Gaussian-Copula approach and illustrates how it improves the simulated flow characteristics in the Shah Bahram basin in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, southwestern Iran. The Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) calculated between the original CHIRPS precipitation estimation and observation in the Shah Bahram basin equals - 0.14; however, when bias-corrected CHIRPS data was compared to observation, the NSE increased to 0.23, suggesting about 158\% improvement in the CHIRPS precipitation estimation when bias-corrected with the Gaussian-Copula approach. Next, the bias-corrected precipitation time series were utilized as the hydrologic modeling system inputs to simulate flow specifications such as discharge and peak value. Then, the simulation of the flow parameters was carried out with both original and bias-corrected CHIRPS satellite precipitation estimations and the ground-based precipitation. Though the NSE statistic of the simulation for the testing period has not changed significantly, the Pbias statistic has considerably improved. The result of the study indicates the good performance of the proposed bias correction approach in reducing the CHIRPS satellite estimations errors, concluding that it is a suitable approach for bias correction of the other satellite precipitation estimations in areas that suffer from the lack of ground-based observations necessary for flood forecasting and other hydrological practices.","{""Mokhtari, Shirin"",""Raziei, Tayeb"",""Sharafati, Ahmad""}","10.1007/s11600-021-00724-0",2024-07-16 23:17:23,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{""values bias correction""}","{""Bias correction; Copula function; Streamflow simulation; Remote sensing; Satellite rainfall estimati""}"

6903483,"Physical Flood Vulnerability Mapping Applying Geospatial Techniques In Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan","Flooding has been increasing since 2004 in Japan due to localized heavy rainfall and geographical conditions. Determining areas vulnerable to flooding as one element of flood hazard maps related to disaster management for urban development is necessary. This research integrated Remote Sensing data, the Geography Information System (GIS) method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculation to determine the physical flood-vulnerable area in Okazaki City. We developed this research by applying data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) to generate the slope map and drainage density; AMEDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System) from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to generate the rainfall data; Soil map from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) data; and Sentinel-2 imagery to generate the land cover map. We applied the AHP calculation for weighting pairwise the parameters by comparing five iterations of the normalized matrix. We utilized the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS to run the pairwise comparison to adjudicate the distribution of flooding according to the AHP procedure. The percentage of relative weight was slope (43\%), drainage density (20\%), rainfall intensity (17\%), then both infiltration rate and land cover (10\%). The consistency value was reasonable: consistency index (CI-0.007) and consistency ratio (CR-0.6\%). We generated high accuracy for flood vulnerability prediction; 0.88 for Probability of Detection (POD), 0.28 for Probability of False Detection (POFD), 0.44 for Critical Success Index (CSI), 1.9 for Bias, and 95 of Area under Curve (AUC).

6863576,"A Landsat-Based Energy Balance And Evapotranspiration Model In Western Us Water Rights Regulation And Planning","The quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated projects is important for water rights management, water resources planning and water regulation. Traditionally, ET has been estimated by multiplying a weather-based reference ET by crop coefficients (Kc) determined according to the crop type and the crop growth stage. However, there is typically question regarding whether crops grown compare with the conditions represented by the Kc values, especially in water short areas. In addition, it is difficult to estimate the correct crop growth stage dates for large populations of crops and fields. METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) is an image-processing model for calculating ET as a residual of the surface energy balance. METRIC is a variant of SEBAL, an energy balance process developed in the Netherlands by Bastiaanssen and was extended to provide tighter integration with ground-based reference ET. METRIC was applied with Landsat images in southern Idaho to predict monthly and seasonal ET for water rights accounting and for operation of ground water models. ET ""maps"" (i.e., images) provide the means to quantify, in terms of both the amount and spatial distribution, the ET on a field by field basis. The ET maps have been used in Idaho to quantify net ground-water pumpage in areas where water extraction from underground is not measured and to estimate recharge from surface-irrigated lands. Application and testing of METRIC indicates substantial promise as an efficient, accurate, and relatively inexpensive procedure to predict the actual evaporation fluxes from irrigated lands throughout a growing season. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.","{""Allen, R.

6863110,"Predicting Treatment Effects In Unipolar Depression: A Meta-Review","There is increasing interest in clinical prediction models in psychiatry, which focus on developing multivariate algorithms to guide personalized diagnostic or management decisions. The main target of these models is the prediction of treatment response to different antidepressant therapies. This is because the ability to predict response based on patients' personal data may allow clinicians to make improved treatment decisions, and to provide more efficacious or more tolerable medications to the right patient. We searched the literature for systematic reviews about treatment prediction in the context of existing treatment modalities for adult unipolar depression, until July 2019. Treatment effect is defined broadly to include efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability outcomes. We first focused on the identification of individual predictor variables that might predict treatment response, and second, we considered multivariate clinical prediction models. Our meta-review included a total of 10 systematic reviews; seven (from 2014 to 2018) focusing on individual predictor variables and three focusing on clinical prediction models. These identified a number of sociodemographic, phenomenological, clinical, neuroimaging, remote monitoring, genetic and serum marker variables as possible predictor variables for treatment response, alongside statistical and machine-learning approaches to clinical prediction model development. Effect sizes for individual predictor variables were generally small and clinical prediction models had generally not been validated in external populations. There is a need for rigorous model validation in large external data-sets to prove the clinical utility of models.

6863335,"Antithrombotic Therapy For Long-Term Secondary Prevention Of Acute Coronary Syndrome In High-Risk Patients","Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represent a major clinical burden, because they tend to experience recurrent ischemic events. Acute management of patients with ACS includes combination antithrombotic therapy composed of a parenteral anticoagulant and dual-antiplatelet therapy. Dual-antiplatelet therapy is also recommended for long-term secondary prevention of ACS. Despite advances in the antithrombotic therapies available, clinical trials suggest that patients with ACS still face a similar to 10\% risk of another event within 12-15 months of the index event. Certain patient populations, such as elderly patients and those with renal impairment or heart failure, are at higher risk of recurrent ACS events, because these patients have more vascular ischemic and bleeding risk factors than most other patients. Evidence from the GRACE and CRUSADE registries suggests underuse of the guideline-recommended evidencebased therapies for the management of ACS in such patients. This review summarizes the current standard of care for patients with ACS, focusing on long-term secondary antithrombotic strategies. Registry data are used to identify high-risk patient populations; the recent antiplatelet and anticoagulant Phase III trial data are summarized to highlight any patient populations who receive greater or lesser benefit from specific long-term antithrombotic strategies. Guideline recommendations are discussed and suggestions are provided to help improve implementation of long-term secondary prevention strategies and patient prognosis after an ACS event.","{""Husted, Steen""}","10.2147/tcrm.s75024",2024-10-03 17:46:05,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2015,"{}","{""acute coronary syndrome; anticoagulants; antiplatelets; risk assessment; secondary prevention""}"
6863037,"Estimation Of Rainfall-Runoff Using Scs-Cn Method And Gis Techniques In Drought-Prone Area Of Upper Kangsabati Watershed, India","Purulia is one of the most intense drought-prone districts of the western part of West Bengal, India. Acute form of water scarcity is a common phenomenon in this area during the hot-summer period. The water scarcity in this study region is due to the presence of monsoonal vagaries, unfavorable lithological condition and availability of poor groundwater. Therefore, watershed management is the primary concern for sustainable development of natural resources like water and land for optimal development of watershed and economic activities. Therefore, optimal measurement of rainfall-induced runoff is indeed necessary to understand the hydrological behavior. Several traditional statistical and advanced machine learning methods has been used previously to measure surface runoff among the researchers. It is difficult to simulate the required runoff with physical-based models due to the complexity and non-linear behavior of the runoff phenomena, as well as the absence of relevant historical data in all places. Thus, in the present research study of gravelly dominated drought-prone area of Upper Kangsabati Watershed (UKW) is considered to assess rainfall-induced surface runoff using most reliable method of Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN), and considering remote sensing and geographic information system platform. The SCS-CN method is very much reliable and till now has been frequently used among the global hydrological community to optimal assessment of surface runoff and adaptation of proper watershed management strategies. Henceforth, in this study SSC-CN method is used in the hard rock terrain landscape of extended plateau fringe of western West Bengal. The estimated result of runoff depth and runoff volume is 979.45 mm and 280.85 m(3), respectively, and the rainfall-runoff is strongly positively correlated with (r) value being 0.98. Additionally, the applied statistical methods and the outcomes of this study will be helpful among the hydrological communities, different stakeholders and policy makers for sustainable watershed management in terms of optimal conserve of water resources and reduced threating of drought condition.","{""Ghosh, Manoranjan"",""Pal, Subodh Chandra"",""Saha, Asish""}","10.1007/s40899-022-00731-z",2024-07-17 21:22:28,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""Upper Kangsabati Watershed; Surface rainfall-runoff; SCS-CN method; Geographic information system""}"
6863201,"Mapping Beach Morphodynamics Remotely: A Novel Application Tested On South African Sandy Shores","Sandy beaches have been identified as threatened ecosystems but despite the need to conserve them, they have been generally overlooked. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) has emerged as an efficient method of selecting areas for conservation priority. However, SCP analyses require digital shapefiles of habitat and species diversity. Mapping these attributes for beaches from field data can take years and requires exhaustive resources. This study thus sought to derive a methodology to classify and map beach morphodynamic types from satellite imagery. Since beach morphodynamics is a strong predictor of macrofauna diversity, they could be considered a good surrogate for mapping beach biodiversity. A dataset was generated for 45 microtidal beaches (of known morphodynamic type) by measuring or coding for several physical characteristics from imagery acquired from Google Earth. Conditional inference trees revealed beach width to be the only factor that significantly predicted beach morphodynamic type, giving four categories: dissipative, dissipative-intermediate, intermediate and reflective. The derived model was tested by using it to predict the morphodynamic type of 28 other beaches of known classification. Model performance was good (75\% prediction accuracy) but misclassifications occurred at the three breaks between the four categories. For beaches around these breaks, consideration of surf zone characteristics in addition to beach width ameliorated the misclassifications. The final methodology yielded a 93\% prediction accuracy of beach morphodynamic type. Overlaying other considerations on this classification scheme could provide additional value to the layer, such that it also describes species' spatial patterns. These could include: biogeographic regions, estuarine versus sandy beaches and short versus long beaches. The classification scheme was applied to the South African shoreline as a case study. The distribution of the beach morphodynamic types was partly influenced by geography. Most of the long, dissipative beaches are found along the west coast of the country, the south coast beaches are mostly dissipative-intermediate, and the east coast beaches range from short, estuarine pocket and embayed beaches in the former Transkei (south east), to longer intermediate and reflective beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (in the north east). Once combined with the three biogeographic regions, and distinguishing between estuarine and sandy shores, the South African coast comprised 24 different beach types. Representing shorelines in this form opens up potential for numerous spatial analyses that can not only further our understanding of sandy beach ecology at large spatial scales but also aid in deriving conservation strategies for this threatened ecosystem.

6862868,"Monitoring Canada's Forests. Part 2: National Forest Fragmentation And Pattern","Canada is one of the world's largest nations, with a land area of nearly one billion hectares. This vast area is home to a number of unique ecosystems, comprised of different climate, land cover, topography, and disturbance characteristics. Depiction of forest composition, based on satellite-derived land cover, is a common means to characterize and identify trends in forest conditions and land use. Forest pattern analyses that consider the size, distribution, and connectivity of forest patches can provide insights to land use, habitat, and biodiversity. In this communication, we present the pattern characteristics of Canada's forests as determined by the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) product, a new land cover classification of the forested area of Canada. The EOSD product (EOSD LC 2000) represents conditions circa the year 2000, mapping each 25 m x 25 m pixel into one of 23 categories. We used the EOSD data to assess forest patterns nationally at four spatial extents: level 1, 13 000 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 250 000 scale National Topographic System (NTS) map sheet); level 2, 800 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 50 000 scale NTS map sheet); level 3, 1 km(2); and level 4, 1 ha. For levels 1-3, a total of 95 landscape pattern metrics were calculated; for the 1 ha units, a subset of eight metrics were calculated. The results of this analysis indicate that Canada's forest pattern varies by ecozone, with some ecozones characterized by large areas of contiguous forest (i.e., Boreal Shield, Atlantic Maritime, and Montane Cordillera), while other ecozones have less forest and are characterized by large numbers of small forest patches, reflecting the complex mosaic of land cover types present (Taiga Shield, Taiga Cordillera). Trends for the subset of metrics used to characterize national conditions are relatively consistent across levels 1-3. Level 4 metrics, where the analysis extent is 1 ha, are well-suited to regional or local analyses. As the first regional assessments of the patterns contained in the EOSD LC 2000, these measures of Canada's forest landscape patterns add value to the national land cover baseline.","{""Cardille, Jeffrey A."",""Coops, Nicholas C."",""Grills, Danny"",""Han, Tian"",""Holland, Tara"",""White, Joanne C."",""Wulder, Michael A.""}","10.5589/m08-081",2024-09-27 23:24:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2008,"{}",NA
6863408,"A Dilemma Between Flood And Drought Management: Case Study Of The Upper Chao Phraya Flood-Prone Area In Thailand","Floods are the greatest natural disaster in Thailand, but they are an important part of recharging the water volume for groundwater resources. This paper focused on evaluating and discussing the relationship between flood magnitudes and flood management impacting groundwater storage in the Upper Chao Phraya River basin in Thailand, where the intensive rice production of the region is located. Based on satellite image data, there were annual flood inundations varying from 1950 to 10,470 km(2) over the period 2005-2019. The evaluation shows those flooding events yielded floodwater recharge of approximately 0.5-5.9 km(3). To lessen the flood damage, floodways with 2000 m(3) s(-1) of drainage capacity are proposed by the government. This measure aims to accelerate flood surplus out to the gulf of Thailand and to confine the flooding areas to a maximum value of 4650 km(2). A reduction of approximately 3.4 km(3) of groundwater storage is estimated if the floodways are implemented. Staple crops in the dry season, especially rice fields outside an irrigation project (rainfed area), cope with water stress. To sustain basin water demand in the dry season, approximately 1820 km(2) should be allowed for an area flooded for a month where 0.9 km(3) of water volume is harvested annually. Although flood control is important, potential impact on the reduction of groundwater recharge needs to be carefully considered. Therefore, a flood control policy shows the balance of available basin water occasionally supplied by the groundwater while rice water demand is being proposed.","{""Ekkawatpanit, Chaiwat"",""Lee, Kwan Tun"",""Pratoomchai, Weerayuth"",""Yoobanpot, Naphol""}","10.3390/w14244056",2024-09-27 23:11:47,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""flood inundation area; floodways; groundwater recharge; rainfed; water balance""}"
6863336,"Remote Sensing Based Binary Classification Of Maize. Dealing With Residual Autocorrelation In Sparse Sample Situations","In order to discuss potential sustainability issues of expanding silage maize cultivation in Rhineland-Palatinate, spatially explicit monitoring is necessary. Publicly available statistical records are often not a sufficient basis for extensive research, especially on soil health, where risk factors like erosion and compaction depend on variables that are specific to every site, and hard to generalize for larger administrative aggregates. The focus of this study is to apply established classification algorithms to estimate maize abundance for each independent pixel, while at the same time accounting for their spatial relationship. Therefore, two ways to incorporate spatial autocorrelation of neighboring pixels are combined with three different classification models. The performance of each of these modeling approaches is analyzed and discussed. Finally, one prediction approach is applied to the imagery, and the overall predicted acreage is compared to publicly available data. We were able to show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and Random Forests (RF) were able to distinguish maize pixels reliably, with kappa values well above 0.9 in most cases. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) performed substantially worse. Furthermore, Regression Kriging (RK) as an approach to integrate spatial autocorrelation into the prediction model is not suitable in use cases with millions of sparsely clustered training pixels. Gaussian Blur is able to improve predictions slightly in these cases, but it is possible that this is only because it smoothes out impurities of the reference data. The overall prediction with RF classification combined with Gaussian Blur performed well, with out of bag error rates of 0.5% in 2009 and 1.3% in 2016. Despite the low error rates, there is a discrepancy between the predicted acreage and the official records, which is 20% in 2009 and 27% in 2016. © 2019 by the authors.","{""Emmerling, C."",""Gilcher, M."",""Ruf, T."",""Udelhoven, T.""}","10.3390/rs11182172",2024-09-30 17:13:01,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{Autocorrelation,""Classification algorithm"",""Classification models"",""Crop classification"",""Decision trees"",Forecasting,""Generalized linear model"",""Health risks"",Interpolation,Pixels,""Regression Kriging"",Regression-kriging,""Remote sensing"",""Spatial autocorrelation"",""Spatial autocorrelations"",""Spatial relationships"",""Support vector machines"",""Sustainability issues""}"

6862927,"Characterization Of Water Quality And The Effects Of Land Use And Seasonality On Springs In Eastern Amazonia","Land-use changes followed by inadequate management may cause serious impacts to springs, generating losses in quality and availability. An alternative to minimize or mitigate potential future impacts is to monitor the water quality parameters of micro-watersheds in the medium-and long-term. This monitoring is essential for planning purposes and governmental environmental regulation, especially in highly altered regions in the Amazon, such as Paragominas, in the state of Pará. This study investigated the influence of land use change and seasonality on the quality of springs. For this purpose, physicochemical parameters characteristic of water quality in five collection points of springs with a surrounding area of distinct land use history were analyzed between 2015 and 2017. Following the current legislation, the only parameter in imbalance was dissolved oxygen (DO). However, these are common values, considering springs. The results showed that most of the parameters presented variation to different land uses. This interpretation was intensified mainly by the variations in Sodium, TN, DO and temperature. However, few of these variables were related to local seasonality (only turbidity, sulfate and potassium). These results prove that it is possible to integrate the change in the use and occupation of the basin, determined by the variations observed in the sampled points. Thus, studies and diagnostics that can subsidize management in basin areas are an important tool to direct public policies to improve environmental and social quality for the population living around these basins. © 2023, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

6863637,"Remote Sensing Classification Of Urban Black-Odor Water Based On Decision Tree","Remote sensing monitoring of black-odor water is an important method for understanding the current status of urban water quality, and comprehensively evaluating the effect of urban water environment treatment. A total of 171 samples were collected in Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Yangzhou cities and water quality parameters and optical parameters were measured simultaneously. Based on the analysis of the water color and optical characteristics of the black-odor water and non-black-odor water (denoted as general water), a decision tree was constructed to identify the severe, mild black-odor water, and general water as green and yellow water. The results found that: (1)According to the water color, the water bodies can be divided into six types. Among them, type 1 to 4 water bodies are black-odor water, which are gray black, dark gray, gray, and light gray water, respectively, and type 5 and 6 water bodies are general water, which are green and yellow water, respectively; (2)Type 1 water body contains high contents of non-pigmented particulate matter and colored dissolved organic matter(CDOM), however, the absorption of pigmented particulate matter is not dominant. Type 2 and 5 water bodies are dominated by pigmented particulate matter. Type 3, 4, and 6 water bodies are dominated by non-pigmented particulate matter; (3)After water color classification, and according to the differences of the reflection spectrums of the six types of water bodies, the difference of black-odorous water index (DBWI), green-red-nir area water index (G-R-NIR AWI), the green band reflectance and the normalized difference black-odorous water index (NDBWI) were used to construct a decision tree to identify the severe, mild black-odor water, and general water; (4)The decision tree was applied to the PlanetScope satellite image of Yangzhou City on April 9, 2019, and 10 synchronous sampling points were used for verification. The overall recognition accuracy reached 80.00%, and the K value reached 0.67.

6863125,"Alluvial Groundwater Recharge Estimation In Semi-Arid Environment Using Remotely Sensed Data","Data limitations on groundwater (GW) recharge over large areas are still a challenge for efficient water resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. Thus, this study seeks to integrate hydrological cycle variables from satellite imagery to estimate the spatial distribution of GW recharge in the Ipanema river basin (IRB), which is located in the State of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. Remote sensing data, including monthly maps (2011-2012) of rainfall, runoff and evapotranspiration, are used as input for the water balance method within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Rainfall data are derived from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 7 (3B43V7) product and present the same monthly average temporal distributions from 15 rain gauges that are distributed over the study area (r = 0.93 and MAE = 12.7 mm), with annual average estimates of 894.3 (2011) and 300.7 mm (2012). The runoff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) method, which is based on regional soil information and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor image, represents 29\% of the TMPA rainfall that was observed across two years of study. Actual evapotranspiration data, which were provided by the SEBAL application of MODIS images, present annual averages of 1213 (2011) and 1067 (2012) mm. The water balance results reveal a large inter-annual difference in the IRB GW recharge, which is characterized by different rainfall regimes, with averages of 30.4 (2011) and 4.7 (2012) mm year(-1). These recharges were mainly observed between January and July in regions with alluvial sediments and highly permeable soils. The GW recharge approach with remote sensing is compared to the WTF (Water Table Fluctuation) method, which is used in an area of alluvium in the IRB. The estimates from these two methods exhibit reliable annual agreement, with average values of 154.6 (WTF) and 124.6 (water balance) mm in 2011. These values correspond to 14.89 and 13.53\% of the rainfall that was recorded at the rain gauges and the TMPA, respectively. Only the WTF method indicates a very low recharge of 15.9 mm for the second year. The values in this paper provide reliable insight regarding the use of remotely sensed data to evaluate the rates of alluvial GW recharge in regions where the potential runoff cannot be disregarded from WB equation and must be calculated spatially.

6903609,"A Sensor Web Architecture For Integrating Smart Oceanographic Sensors Into The Semantic Sensor Web","Effective ocean and coastal data management are needed to manage marine ecosystem health. Past ocean and coastal data management systems were often very specific to a particular application and region, but this focused approach often lacks real-time data and sharing/interoperating capability. The challenge for the ocean observing community is to devise standards and practices that enable integration of data from sensors across devices, manufacturers, users, and domains to enable new types of application and services that facilitate much more comprehensive understanding and analyses of marine ecosystem. A given kind of sensor may be deployed on various platforms such as floats, gliders or moorings, and thus must be integrated with different operation. and data management systems. Simplifying the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems would benefit system operators and is important for the broader application of diverse sensors. This paper describes a geospatial ""sensor web"" architecture developed by the ""NeXOS"" project for ocean and coastal data management, based on the concepts of spatial data infrastructure and the Sensor Web Enablement framework of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This approach reduces the effort to propagate data front deployed sensors to users.

6691564,"Remote Sensing in Environmental Justice Research—A Review","Human health is known to be affected by the physical environment. Various environmental influences have been identified to benefit or challenge people’s physical condition. Their heterogeneous distribution in space results in unequal burdens depending on the place of living. In addition, since societal groups tend to also show patterns of segregation, this leads to unequal exposures depending on social status. In this context, environmental justice research examines how certain social groups are more affected by such exposures. Yet, analyses of this per se spatial phenomenon are oftentimes criticized for using “essentially aspatial” data or methods which neglect local spatial patterns by aggregating environmental conditions over large areas. Recent technological and methodological developments in satellite remote sensing have proven to provide highly detailed information on environmental conditions. This narrative review therefore discusses known influences of the urban environment on human health and presents spatial data and applications for analyzing these influences. Furthermore, it is discussed how geographic data are used in general and in the interdisciplinary research field of environmental justice in particular. These considerations include the modifiable areal unit problem and ecological fallacy. In this review we argue that modern earth observation data can represent an important data source for research on environmental justice and health. Especially due to their high level of spatial detail and the provided large-area coverage, they allow for spatially continuous description of environmental characteristics. As a future perspective, ongoing earth observation missions, as well as processing architectures, ensure data availability and applicability of ’big earth data’ for future environmental justice analyses.","{""Weigland, Matthias""}","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8010020",2024-04-22 02:23:27,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",""Review or opinion""}",2019,"{}","{""satellite remote sensing|review|environmental justice|big earth data|urban environments""}"
6903548,"A Partition Modeling For Anthropogenic Heat Flux Mapping In China","Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities has a major impact on urban and regional climate. Accurately estimating anthropogenic heat is of great significance for studies on urban thermal environment and climate change. In this study, a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation scheme was constructed based on socio-economic data, energy-consumption data, and multi-source remote sensing data using a partition modeling method, which takes into account the regional characteristics of AH emission caused by the differences in regional development levels. The refined AHF mapping in China was realized with a high resolution of 500 m. The results show that the spatial distribution of AHF has obvious regional characteristics in China. Compared with the AHF in provinces, the AHF in Shanghai is the highest which reaches 12.56W·m-2, followed by Tianjin, Beijing, and Jiangsu. The AHF values are 5.92 W·m-2, 3.35 W·m-2, and 3.10 W·m-2, respectively. As can be seen from the mapping results of refined AHF, the high-value AHF aggregation areas are mainly distributed in north China, east China, and south China. The high-value AHF in urban areas is concentrated in 50-200 W·m-2, and maximum AHF in Shenzhen urban center reaches 267 W·m-2. Further, compared with other high resolution AHF products, it can be found that the AHF results in this study have higher spatial heterogeneity, which can better characterize the emission characteristics of AHF in the region. The spatial pattern of the AHF estimation results correspond to the distribution of building density, population, and industry zone. The high-value AHF areas are mainly distributed in airports, railway stations, industry areas, and commercial centers. It can thus be seen that the AHF estimation models constructed by the partition modeling method can well realize the estimation of large-scale AHF and the results can effectively express the detailed spatial distribution of AHF in local areas. These results can provide technical ideas and data support for studies on surface energy balance and urban climate change. © 2019 by the authors.",NA,"10.3390/rs11091132",2024-10-01 17:58:26,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

After the easing of restrictions, the LST increased to exceed the previous 4-year mean LST. Furthermore, throughout all studied periods, the LST recorded its higher values in industrial zones and areas with high urban density and urban transportation, which indicates the conspicuous impact of anthropogenic activities on the LST variation.

However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel. © 2018 by the authors.",NA,"10.3390/w10111701",2024-10-03 22:04:37,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

Air Pollution is severely degrading the quality of air and climatic systems and is affecting the health of the people and plants. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal distributions of some selected air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) and their association with NDVI in Lahore and its adjoining regions from July 2018 to December 2020. The present study utilized air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) observations obtained from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5P, and NDVI retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra satellite. The mean annual high NO2 concentrations of 163.0 × 10–6 mol m−2, 160.0 × 10–6 mol m−2, and 154.0 × 10–6 mol m−2 were found over northwestern, central, and southern boundaries of Lahore, respectively, while the SO2 concentration of 315.4 × 10–6 mol m−2 was observed over the northwestern boundary of Lahore. Moreover, the mean annual NDVI ranging from 0.5 to 0.65 was observed in the east, northeast, southeast and outside the boundary of Lahore towards Amritsar. The monthly time series analyses show that the highest values of NO2, SO2 and NDVI are found to be 149 × 10–6 ± 1.58 × 10–5 (mole m−2), 544 × 10–6 ± 1.68 × 10–4 (mole m−2), and 0.670 ± 0.12 in January 2019, December 2020 and February 2019, respectively. The highest correlation between NO2 and SO2 with NDVI is found to be 0.95 and 0.87, respectively in the southwest, and southeast directions.

6862912,"Geomorphic And Land Cover Identification Of Dust Sources In The Eastern Great Basin Of Utah, Usa","This study identifies anthropogenically disturbed areas and barren playa surfaces as the two primary dust source types that repeatedly contribute to dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of western Utah, U.S.A. This semi-arid desert region is an important contributor to dust production in North America, with this study being the first to specifically identify and characterize regional dust sources. From 2004 to 2010, a total of 51 dust event days (DEDs) affected the air quality in Salt Lake City, UT. MODIS satellite imagery during 16 of these DEDs was analyzed to identify dust plumes, and assess the characteristics of dust source areas. A total of 168 plumes were identified, and showed mobilization of dust from Quaternary deposits located within the Bonneville Basin. This analysis identifies 4 major and 5 secondary source areas for dust in this region, which produce dust primarily during the spring and fall months and during moderate or greater drought conditions, with a Palmer Drought Index (PDI) of 2 or less. The largest number of observed dust plumes (similar to 60\% of all plumes) originated from playas (ephemeral lakes) and are classified as barren land cover with a silty clay soil sediment surface. Playa surfaces in this region undergo numerous recurrent anthropogenic disturbances, including military operations and anthropogenic water withdrawal. Anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to produce dust from the vegetated landscape in the eastern Great Basin, as evidenced by the new dust source active from 2008 to 2010 in the area burned by the 2007 Milford Flat Fire; this fire was the largest in Utah's history due to extensive cover of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) along with drought conditions. However, dust mobilization from the Milford Flat Burned Area was limited to regions that had been significantly disturbed by post-fire land management techniques that consisted of seeding, followed by chaining or tilling of the soil. Dust storms in the eastern Great Basin negatively impact air quality and transportation in the populated regions of Utah; this study details an improved forecasting protocol for dust storm events that will benefit transportation planning and improve public health.

6863190,"Rangeland Productivity Partitioned To Sub-Pixel Plant Functional Types","Understanding and monitoring the dynamics of rangeland heterogeneity through time and across space is critical for the effective management and conservation of rangeland systems and the sustained supply of the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Conventional approaches (both field-based and remote sensing) to monitoring rangeland productivity fail to effectively capture important aspects of this heterogeneity. While field methods can effectively capture high levels of detail at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, they are limited in their applicability and scalability to larger spatial extents and longer time periods. Alternatively, remote sensing based approaches that scale broad spatiotemporal extents simplify important heterogeneity occurring at fine scales. We address these limitations to monitoring rangeland productivity by combining a continuous plant functional type (PFT) fractional cover dataset with a Landsat derived gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) model. Integrating the annual PFT dataset with a 16-day Landsat normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) composite dataset enabled us to disaggregate the pixel level NDVI values to the sub-pixel PFTs. These values were incorporated into the productivity algorithm, enabling refined estimations of 16-day GPP and annual NPP for the PFTs that composed each pixel. We demonstrated the results of these methods on a set of representative rangeland sites across the western United States. Partitioning rangeland productivity to sub-pixel PFTs revealed new dynamics and insights to aid the sustainable management of rangelands.","{""Allred, Brady W."",""Erickson, Tyler A."",""Jones, Matthew O."",""Moreno, Alvaro"",""Naugle, David E."",""Robinson, Nathaniel P.""}","10.3390/rs11121427",2024-07-18 20:46:59,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{algorithm,maybe}","{""rangelands; plant functional types; gross primary productivity; net primary productivity; NDVI; frac""}"
6863705,"Governance Issues Constraining The Deployment Of Flood Resilience Strategies In Maroua, Far North Region Of Cameroon","Purpose - Cities across the globe, particularly those of the less developed world, face long-term challenges associated with floods which impact negatively on the resilience of city systems and their inhabitants. In the city of Maroua, most urban management stakeholders have been unable to integrate flood resilience research into urban development issues. It is against this background that the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the governance issues constraining the deployment of flood resilience strategies implemented by residents in flood-prone zones and those used by the government via administrative authorities and institutions charged with urban development to flood-related risks in the city of Maroua, Far North Region of Cameroon. Design/methodology/approach - Field surveys, participant observations, interviews, and on-the-spot appraisals were carried out with residents in flood-prone neighbourhoods and municipal authorities on the state of recurrent floods including mitigating strategies being implemented. Findings - The results revealed that Maroua has a fragile ecological setting which has increased the vulnerability of the town to flood-related risks. This is further aggravated by the fact that municipal authorities are yet to have a thorough mastery of such recurrent flood incidences due to their limited planning horizons, rendering the urban poor disproportionately susceptible to flood-related stresses. This exposes them to unavoidable flood associated hazards such as water borne diseases (typhoid and cholera) as they are bogged down by physical and financial limitations. Besides, decision-making processes in relation to managing urban systems are not guided by good governance as efforts to enhance and integrate the local population for flood resilience are neither participatory nor inclusive, ushering the urban environment of Maroua into a frivolous path to profligacy. Originality/value - For resilience to be deeply entrenched, the paper proffers for the mainstreaming of flood resilience strategies into urban development plans through multi-stakeholder involvement across different sectors and departments, as well as the setting up of a practical time table for monitoring the progress of these measures through geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and geographical information systems.","{""Ndi, Roland Akoh"",""Wanie, Clarkson Mvo""}","10.1108/dpm-12-2017-0300",2024-07-18 22:01:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2018,"{}","{""Resilience; Floods; Vulnerability; Urban development; Cameroon; Maroua""}"
6863049,"Multi-Objective Optimization Of Crop Planting Structure Based On Remote Sensing And Ant Colony Algorithm","A water saving and multi-objective planting structure optimization model was put forward against the mismatching between regional planting structure and water resources. Based on the matching degree between water requirement at different crop growing stages and the regional precipitation as well as the crop planting structure obtained by remote sensing, a planting structure optimization model with multiple objectives such as water saving, economic and ecological benefits in the irrigated area was established. With Wuquan irrigation district in Baojixia as an example, the model was optimized with ant colony algorithm. The total water requirements for irrigation district of plan 1 and plan 2 is respectively 85.4% and 83.4% of the present situation. The income of plan 1 is lower 5.4% and the plan 2 is higher7.1% than common years. Meanwhile the income of plan 1 is lower 5.9% and the project 2 is higher 7.3% than the droughty years. The coupling degree of precipitation of plan 1 and plan 2 is respectively higher 12.6% and 15.6% than common years while higher 17.5% and 28.6% than droughty years. The comparison between the two plans of controlled optimization shows that the second one is the better readjustment plan because, without changing the planting area, the structure optimization helps not only maintain the sustainable development of the environment but also improve the economic income dramatically. It is practically and theoretically for agricultural water saving planning.","{""Chen, J."",""Li, Y."",""Liu, J."",""Wang, Z."",""Zhang, Z.""}","10.3969/j.issn.1674-8530.2011.02.12",2024-07-12 19:25:21,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2011,"{}","{""Agricultural water"",Algorithms,""Ant colony algorithm"",""Ant colony algorithms"",""Coupling degree"",""Crop growing stages"",""Crop planting structure"",Crops,Cultivation,""Ecological benefits"",Irrigation,""Irrigation districts"",""Matching degree"",""Mathematical models"",""Multi objective"",""Multiobjective optimization"",""Multiple objectives"",Optimization,""Present situation"",""Remote sensing"",""Shape optimization"",""Structural optimization"",""Structure optimization"",Structure-based,""Sustainable development"",""Water conservation"",""Water management"",""Water requirements"",""Water saving""}"

6447810,"The Costs and Costs Avoided From Wildfire Fire Management—A Conceptual Framework for a Value of Information Analysis","Wildﬁre is an integral part of many ecosystems, and wildland ﬁres also have the potential for costly impacts to human health and safety, and damage to structures and natural resources. Public land managers use various strategies for managing landscape conditions that can affect wildﬁre, broadly: fuel treatment (and other pre-ﬁre risk mitigation), ﬁre suppression, and post-ﬁre landscape rehabilitation. However, with any of these strategies there is considerable uncertainty in the outcomes that managers can obtain, and thus on the societal costs and beneﬁts associated with wildland ﬁre management. Managers address that uncertainty by using available information to inform their strategy choices. The value of information (VOI) to the land manager is deﬁned as the expected gains from improved wildland ﬁre management outcomes that result from using the information. This paper discusses estimating the value of information using two approaches: a microeconomic theoretical approach, and the Bayesian decisiontree approach frequently used in the VOI literature. These approaches could be used for valuing speciﬁc pieces of information (with absolute values), and for prioritizing (with relative values) which areas to focus on for future research.","{""Crowley, Christian"",""Franco, Fabiano"",""Simon, Benjamin""}","10.3389/fenvs.2022.804958",NA,NA,NA,2022,"{}",NA

The results showed that the average RSEI of Nanjing decreased from 0.626 to 0.618 during 2000-2017. The RSEI values could be divided into five grades: bad, poor, fair, good and excellent. The proportion of area above good grade decreased from 61.0% to 57.1%, while that below poor grade increased slightly. Compared with 2000, the proportion of areas with improved ecological environment quality was 34.5%, 34.7% area had deteriorated, and 30.8% area remained unchanged in 2017. Among them, the ecological quality of main urban area had significantly improved, and the area with improved ecological quality exceeded that of deterioration. The ecological quality of new urban area and suburbs had deteriorated. The area with poor ecological environment exceeded the area of improvement.

6903496,"Spatiotemporal Impact Of Urbanization On Urban Heat Island And Urban Thermal Field Variance Index Of Tianjin City, China","The rapid infrastructure development in densely populated areas has had several negative impacts. Increases in urbanization have led to increased LST, and urban ecological systems have been negatively affected. Urban heat islands (UHIs) can be mitigated by understanding how current and future LST phenomena are linked to changes in landscape composition and land use cover (LUC). This study investigated the multi-scale spatial analysis of LUC and LST in Tianjin using remote sensing and GIS data. We used Landsat data from 2005 to 2020 to examine the effects of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration. According to the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), the city's ecological evaluation was carried out. Results show that changes in LUC and other anthropogenic activities affect the spatial distribution of LST. For the study years (2004-2009), the estimated mean LST in Tianjin was 25.32 degrees C, 26.73 degrees C, 27.62 degrees C, and 27.93 degrees C. Between LST and urban areas with other infrastructures, and NDBI, significant positive correlation values were found about 0.53, 0.48, and 0.76 (p < 0.05), respectively. Temperatures would almost certainly increase by 3.87 degrees C to 7.26 degrees C as a result of decreased plant cover and increased settlements. These findings strongly imply a correlation between LST and the vegetation index. Between 2005 and 2020, the anticipated increase in LST of 3.39 degrees C is expected to harm urban environmental health. This study demonstrates how Tianjin and other cities can achieve ecological sustainability.",NA,"10.3390/buildings12040399",2024-09-30 17:14:07,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6903533,"Analysis Of Land Damage And Recovery Process In Rare Earth Mining Area Based On Multi-Source Sequential Ndvi","The problem of land and ecological environment damage caused by ion mining has attracted more and more attention. Taking the Lingbei rare earth mining area as an example, combined with remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time sequence analysis method, we used HJ-1B CCD (charge-coupled device), Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing data during 1990-2016, and analyzed land distribution and rare earth mining area damage and recovery process. In order to reduce the NDVI error caused by the sensor itself, NDVI conversion equation of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8 data was constructed by using the regression analysis method, NDVI image of HJ-1B CCD was transformed into the NDVI image corresponding to the years of Landsat 5/8 (the analog image) by using conversion equation, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the simulated image and the real Landsat 5/8 NDVI image was calculated and the accuracy of the transformation equation was verified. The results showed that the R2 values of NDVI equations from HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5, HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 8 data were 0.9319 and 0.9552, both more than 0.9, indicating that there is obvious linear positive correlation between the NDVI of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8. The RMSE values of NDVI imaging between simulation images and real Landsat 5, and simulation images and real Landsat 8 were 0.0293 and 0.040, which were less than 0.05, showing that the obtained conversion equation has high accuracy and can eliminate the influence of different data sources on the NDVI. Combining NDVI threshold of mining and non-mining, and threshold of non-rare earth mining interference and rare earth mining interference, Lingbei rare earth mining area had annual rare earth mining activity from 1990 to 2016, rare earth mining area of which was smaller in 1990, 1991,1995 and 2000, mining area was more than 1 km2 in 2001-2006, and the mining area reached 2.546 1 km2 in 2006; after 2006, to maintain the rare earth mining scale at the lower level, the country began to implement control of rare earth mining, and the spatial distribution of rare earth mining was more dispersed, which not only caused difficulties in supervision and waste of resources, but also increased governance difficulties to a certain extent. Testing the extraction accuracy of land destruction and restoration type, extraction accuracy of various types was found above 85%, most of which reached more than 90%, satisfying the requirement of accuracy. Analysis of land destruction and restoration type showed that the area that was not disturbed was 97.082 1 km2, accounting for 45.41% of the total mining area; anthropogenic disturbance area was 116.709 3 km2, accounting for 54.59% of the total mining area; the area affected by deforestation disturbance was the largest, which was 86.534 1 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration was 3 years; the arable land that was not abandoned occupied 5.404 5 km2; cultivated land abandoned for many years and that for returning to forest occupied 9.390 6 km2; orchard development area was 3.148 2 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration for 7 years; rare earth mining occupied 11.354 4 km2, whose average recovery time was 11 years, and the recovery of the reclamation area was 5.004 9 km2, so there was still 6.349 5 km2 area with the regional vegetation that did not be recovered, and relevant departments should pay attention to the situation. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Changes within the basin are the driving factors affecting the ecosystem in the watershed; therefore, it is important to analyze the changes in the ecological environment of Miyun Reservoir. For the analysis of a long time series of image data remotely sensed by satellite, the outliers caused by atmospheric, lighting, and sensor measurement errors are significant, and it is difficult for traditional algorithms to effectively recover the true image value. To address this, this paper proposes a theoretical model for predicting spatio-temporal variation based on deep learning to identify and correct invalid and anomalous values in extended time series data.

6903642,"Satellite Altimetry For Ocean And Coastal Applications: A Review","More than 30 years of observations from an international suite of satellite altimeter missions continue to provide key data enabling research discoveries and a broad spectrum of operational and user-driven applications. These missions were designed to advance technologies and to answer scientific questions about ocean circulation, ocean heat content, and the impact of climate change on these Earth systems. They are also a valuable resource for the operational needs of oceanographic and weather forecasting agencies that provide information to shipping and fishing vessels and offshore operations for route optimization and safety, as well as for other decision makers in coastal, water resources, and disaster management fields. This time series of precise measurements of ocean surface topography (OST)-the ""hills and valleys"" of the ocean surface-reveals changes in ocean dynamic topography, tracks sea level variations at global to regional scales, and provides key information about ocean trends reflecting climate change in our warming world. Advancing technologies in new satellite systems allows measurements at higher spatial resolution ever closer to coastlines, where the impacts of storms, waves, and sea level rise on coastal communities and infrastructure are manifest. We review some collaborative efforts of international space agencies, including NASA, CNES, NOAA, ESA, and EUMETSAT, which have contributed to a collection of use cases of satellite altimetry in operational and decision-support contexts. The extended time series of ocean surface topography measurements obtained from these satellite altimeter missions, along with advances in satellite technology that have allowed for higher resolution measurements nearer to coasts, has enabled a range of such applications. The resulting body of knowledge and data enables better assessments of storms, waves, and sea level rise impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure amongst other key contributions for societal benefit. Although not exhaustive, this review provides a broad overview with specific examples of the important role of satellite altimetry in ocean and coastal applications, thus justifying the significant resource contributions made by international space agencies in the development of these missions.",NA,"10.3390/rs15163939",2024-09-26 00:47:03,"excluded","{""Review or opinion""}",NA,"{}",NA

The study presented here aims to identify landslide hazards and risk hotspots in the NW Himalaya. The area is strategically important due the many holy pilgrimage sites and major hydropower projects. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was used to generate the landslide susceptibility map, which was combined with the rainfall intensity map to create the hazard map. To determine the spatial landslide vulnerability, land use and land cover components were taken into account with their respective monetary values. The landslide risk map is the combination of landslide hazard and vulnerability maps, showing that ∼5% of the area falls in high and very high-risk zones, ∼6% in moderate, ∼47% in low, and ∼42% in very low landslide risk zones. High to very high landslide risk zones are mainly confined to Uttarkashi and its surroundings in the southwestern part of the study area, as well as the Tehri, Karanprayag, and Pithoragarh regions in the southern area.

6862730,"A Quantitative Framework For Analysing Long Term Spatial Clustering And Vegetation Fragmentation In An Urban Landscape Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data","Rapid urbanization threatens urban green spaces and vegetation, demonstrated by a decrease in connectivity and higher levels of fragmentation. Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been sufficiently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994-2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by significantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p < 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city. This suggest that with increasing vegetation fragmentation, small and isolated vegetation patches do not spatially cluster but are dispersed geographically. The findings of the study underline the potential of LISA measures as a valuable spatially explicit method for the assessment of spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban vegetation patterns.","{""Dube, Timothy"",""Kowe, Pedzisai"",""Mutanga, Onisimo"",""Odindi, John""}","10.1016/j.jag.2020.102057",2024-07-19 20:36:35,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{algorithm}","{""Urban vegetation; Fragmentation; LISA; Spatial clustering; Harare; Landsat""}"
6862828,"Overview Of The Ocean Climatology And Its Variability In The Azores Region Of The North Atlantic Including Environmental Characteristics At The Seabed","Obtaining a comprehensive knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations of the environmental factors characterizing the Azores region is essential for conservation and management purposes. Although many studies are available for the region, there is a need for a general overview of the best available information. Here, we assembled a comprehensive collection of environmental data and briefly described the ocean climatology and its variability in the Azores. Data sources used in this study included remote sensing oceanographic data for 2003-2013 (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate inorganic carbon, and particulate organic carbon), derived oceanographic data (primary productivity and North Atlantic oscillation index) for 2003-2013, and in situ data (temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate) obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. We have produced 78 geographic datasets of environmental data for the Azores region that were deposited at the World Data Center Pangaea and also made available at the SIGMAR Azores website. As with previous studies, our results confirmed a high spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the marine environment in the Azores region, typical of mid-latitudes. For example, lower sea surface temperature was found in the northern part of the study area coinciding with higher values for chlorophyll-a concentration, net primary production (NPP), and particulate organic and inorganic carbon. Higher values for some of these parameters were also found on island slopes and some seamounts. Compiled data on the environmental conditions at near-seabed revealed some notable variations across the study area (e.g., oxygen and nutrients) and with depth (e.g., temperature, salinity, and oxygen). Knowledge of these patterns will help improve our understanding of the distribution of many deep-sea organisms such as fish, cold-water corals, and sponges, thereby supporting the implementation of marine spatial planning and other management measures. It should be noted that the assembled datasets suffer from a number of limitations related to the accuracy of remote sensing and global bathymetry data, or to the limited and unevenly distributed collection of environmental observations. Accordingly, an effective observing system for detecting oceanic change with adequate accuracy and precision is still required.","{""Amorim, Patricia"",""Cardigos, Frederico"",""Juliano, Manuela"",""Morato, Telmo"",""Peran, Antonio D."",""Pham, Christopher K."",""Tempera, Fernando""}","10.3389/fmars.2017.00056",2024-07-15 16:03:12,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""Azores; environmental parameters; seabed conditions; sea surface temperature; chlorophyll-a""}"

Design/methodology/approach - Although there are several methods to measure institutional change, this paper relied on Kaufmann et al. (2010)'s governance indicators that capture, historically, how authority is exercised in a nation state. As the focus of this paper is on how information flows have empowered citizens in the Arab world, we built a panel database around one relevant governance indicator: ""Voice and Accountability"". As a measure of governance, ""Voice and Accountability"" summarizes the condition of political, civil and human rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of association in a given country. This indicator takes scores ranging from 2.5, corresponding to strong governance, to -2.5, corresponding to weak governance. Findings - As predicted, the information flows variable has a positive and significant effect on institutional change. Table II also suggests that political globalization has a positive and significant effect on institutional change in the Arab world. In contrast, the variables for cultural proximity and human capital are associated with negative effects on institutional change. Originality/value - This paper is unique in the sense that it tackles a growing trend in the Arab world, namely, the impact of media on institutions.","{""Benmamoun, Mamoun"",""Cropf, Robert A."",""Kalliny, Morris"",""Kim, Seung H.""}","10.1108/mbr-09-2014-0048",2024-07-17 19:39:40,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",2015,"{}","{""Media; Arab; Political globalization""}"

In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of studies since 2006 on the health impacts of wildfire smoke and of approaches for the estimation of the associated economic cost. We focus on the choice of key variables such as cost estimators for determining the economic impact of mortality and morbidity effects. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion and guidance on the functioning, advantages and challenges of BenMAP-CE, freely available software of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that has been used in a growing number of studies to assess cost from wildfire smoke. We highlight what generates differences in outcomes between relevant studies and make suggestions for increasing the comparability between studies. All studies, however, demonstrate highly significant health cost from smoke exposure, in the millions or billions of US dollars, often driven by increases in mortality. The results indicate the need to take health cost into account for a comprehensive analysis of wildfire impacts.","{""Dittrich, Ruth""}","https://doi.org/10.1071/WF19091",2024-04-25 02:32:50,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI"",""Review or opinion""}",2020,"{}",NA

It is limited to temperate and boreal regions and to remote sensing in the visible and near infra-red spectra. It is structured as follows: firstly, the forestry planning problem is defined and information requirements are identified; secondly, the attempts to use satellite remote sensing as an information source for forestry planning are reviewed, divided into the topics inventory and monitoring; and, finally, the methods for extracting forest information from satellite images are re-examined, and their inherent limitations and methodological weaknesses are discussed.

6863586,"Cost Factors In Urban Telemedicine","This paper reports on the cost effectiveness of a pediatric primary care system utilizing nurse practitioners (NPs) linked to a physician consultant through bidirectional interactive cable television. In addition, it discusses ways in which multiple uses enhance the economic feasibility of a telemedicine consultation link in a given geographic area. The overall consultation rate during periods of remote physician coverage was 21 per cent, compared with 24 per cent during on-site coverage. The telephone became a partial substitute for the TV for some uses but could not replace it in diagnostic decisions. As telemedicine is obviously underutilized in a one-satellite system, we compare a five-satellite network with other ways of delivering service. The resulting estimated cost of $18.50 an hour, or 2/3 of the cost of a physician providing direct care, includes a TV component of $5.30 an hour of use in a 1,750-hour year. The critical factor is that the NP can be a physician substitute if there is TV backup. The TV appears to prevent unnecessary referrals compared to a physician on site. Whether TV increases the length of the consult compared to the phone for conditions of equal severity is not entirely clear. If TV is compared to transporting a patient to a central place, the implicit value of transport time and disutility required to justify using TV is $7.55 per consult in a five-clinic network. Geographic and other barriers to physician availability enhance the potential for application of telemedicine. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.","{""Cunningham, N."",""Krasneh, M."",""Marshall, C.

6863372,"Decadal Changes In Land Use And Land Cover: Impacts And Their Influence On Urban Ecosystem Services","The steady growth of the cities alters the urban environmental pattern and functions, posing significant challenges to urban ecological as well as environmental governance. Under this setting, analyzing the relationship between urban growth and ecological services is critical for management and policy-related sustainable urban development. The primary goal of this research is to analyse the dynamic urbanization and its influence on urban ecosystem services via changes in LULC of Mangaluru city agglomeration, India. For five decades (1980,1990, 2000, 2010, and 2022), the ecosystem service values (ESVs) are analysed using remote sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global value coefficient (VC) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESVt) and individual ecosystem service function change. The study shows that ecosystem service values (ESVs) declined by US\$ 116.89 million to US\$ 85.14 million due to 9.54 and 63.44\% decreases in agricultural land and wasteland/shrubland between 1980 and 2022. In terms of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased from 1980 to 2022, with nutrient cycling (45.64\%), raw material (15.59\%), and erosion control (12.13\%) contributing the most. The loss in total and certain individual ESV in the study landscape necessitates immediate action to improve urban ecosystem sustainability via proper planning and policy.HIGHLIGHTSThe quantification of ecosystem services (ES) plays an important role in properly understanding and efficiently managing social-ecological systems. The decrease in agricultural land and shrubland/wasteland is the main reason for the degradation of ecosystem services. The findings point out that regional or local-level ecosystem services-related work is immensely important and a hotspot of current research.","{""Devi, Nandineni Rama"",""Nayak, Deeksha"",""Shukla, Anoop Kumar""}","10.2166/aqua.2024.211",2024-07-12 19:36:13,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{}","{""ecosystem service valuation; LULC; Mangaluru; sensitivity analysis""}"
6862918,"Towards A Comprehensive And Consistent Global Aquatic Land Cover Characterization Framework Addressing Multiple User Needs","Aquatic land cover represents the land cover type that is significantly influenced by the presence of water over an extensive part of a year. Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and character-ization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity, and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution, intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems.","{""Clevers, Jan G.

6863321,"New Ocean, New Needs: Application Of Pteropod Shell Dissolution As A Biological Indicator For Marine Resource Management","Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

6863163,"Hyperspectral Assessment Of Soil Fertility In Farm Fields In Fukushima Decontaminated After The Radioactive Fallout","Farmland in the Fukushima region of Japan experienced unprecedented radioactive contamination as a result of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster in 2011. Many fields (4,950 ha; over 30,000 fields to date) have been decontaminated by replacing the top surface soil with non-contaminated soil. However, the fertility of these fields is quite low and within-field heterogeneity is marked. Accordingly, appropriate management of soil and fertilizer is required for recovery of crop productivity in these decontaminated fields. Remote sensing can play a critical role in rapid spatial assessment of soil fertility. This preliminary study investigated the potential of spectral sensing approaches based on hyperspectral reflectance measurements (400-2500 nm) of soil samples from a decontaminated paddy field in the Fukushima region. Spectral index algorithms (the ratio spectral index {[}RSI] and normalized difference spectral index {[}NDSI]) and multivariate regression methods (partial least-squares regression {[}PLSR] and interval PLSR {[}iPLSR]) were used to identify accurate, robust predictive models. The iPLSR and PLSR showed higher predictive accuracy than the other methods (r(val)(2) = 0.937 and 0.802, respectively). The best spectral indices explored using RSI and NDSI have good potential for assessing the spatial variability of soil carbon content (SC; r(val)(2) = 0.730 similar to 0.844), despite using only two wavebands. The results from the RSI map (or NDSI map) approach provided useful information for creating optimal algorithms for assessing SC values using various sensors, including high-resolution optical satellite sensors. Although we must note that optimal algorithms and their applicability are often site-specific depending on soil type and surface conditions, our results imply that these spectral sensing methods can contribute to the recovery of soil fertility of decontaminated fields in the Fukushima region through careful calibration/validation procedures with sufficient in situ data.","{""Inoue, Yoshio"",""Iwasaki, Akira"",""Nemoto, Tomoaki"",""Ono, Tsukasa"",""Saito, Takashi""}","10.1080/00380768.2020.1753237",2024-09-27 22:57:45,"excluded","{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}",2020,"{}","{""Decontamination; Fukushima; hyperspectral; nuclear pollution; remote sensing; soil fertility""}"
6863016,"Assessment Of Water Quality Based On Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager Associated With Human Activities In Korea","Water pollution such as green algae blooms and eutrophication in freshwater fatally influences both water quality and human society. Water quality issues in the 4 major rivers in Korea, including the Nakdong, have recently become a major concern. For this reason, it is essential to monitor water quality parameters (WQPs) that have a widespread characteristic to ensure maintenance of an effective water management system. The possibility of utilizing remote sensing technology for monitoring water quality on a regional scale has been recently investigated. The main objective of this study is to evaluate potential applications of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for estimating water quality in the Nakdong River, Korea. Correlations between Landsat 8 bands and in situ measurements are determined, and water quality models are established for estimating suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total phosphorus (TP). The results demonstrate that WQPs correlated well with band reflectance values from Landsat 8. Band 5 was reasonably correlated with all WQPs, particularly with SS (R = −0.74) and Chl-a (R = −0.71). This study constructed multiple regression equations for WQPs based on correlation analysis through band combination and band ratio. The spatial distribution of WQPs in the Nakdong River on October 27, 2013 and May 16, 2014 indicate that the river was nearly eutrophic from human activities. Based on the results, the Landsat 8 OLI may be an appropriate data for estimating and monitoring water quality parameters on a regional scale. However, further validation is required to support the findings of this study. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","{""Choi, M."",""Lim, J.""}","10.1007/s10661-015-4616-1",2024-07-17 00:05:11,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}","{Algae,""Assessment of water qualities"",Chlorophyll,Chlorophyta,Correlation,""Correlation methods"",""Environmental Monitoring"",Eutrophication,""Fresh Water"",""Human Activities"",""Landsat 8 OLI"",""Multiple regression equation"",""Nakdong River"",Nitrogen,Phosphorus,""Quality control"",Reflection,""Remote sensing"",""Republic of Korea"",""River pollution"",Rivers,""Satellite Imagery"",""South Korea"",""Spatial distribution"",""Water Pollution"",""Water Quality"",""Water management"",""Water quality parameters"",""chlorophyll a"",""river water""}"
6863453,"Optimizing Natural Boundary Definition And Functional Zoning In Protected Areas: An Integrated Framework Encompassing Species, Landscapes And Ecosystems","To promote the harmonized development of economic construction and ecological protection, our study introduces an integrated framework that employs various methodologies to delineate natural reserve boundaries and spatial zoning. These methodologies aim to address issues such as insufficient protected area, excessive human-induced influences, and inadequate protection of endangered animals within nature reserve boundaries. Leveraging comprehensive data from diverse sources, including ground surveys and remote sensing detection, we conducted a survey using the Chebaling National Nature Reserve in China and its environs as a case study. Models such as the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), Fragstats, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) were employed to identify areas with highly suitable habitats, significant landscape diversity, and superior ecosystem quality for 16 key species. Subsequently, the irreplaceable value of the research area was calculated using the Marxan model, leading to the establishment of a novel natural boundary and development plan. We propose expanding the original nature reserve to 1344 km², dividing it into a core reserve (321 km², 23.88%) and a general control area (1023 km², 76.12%). Additionally, we recommend further division of the general protected area into several functional zones to facilitate the integration of functional diversity and ecological protection. This contributes to a more scientifically informed and rational management approach for the Chebaling National Nature Reserve. Moreover, this integrated framework offers valuable insights for assessing and identifying animal habitats globally and spatially zoning other nature reserves. © 2023 The Authors","{""Chen, F."",""Ma, Y."",""Shang, E."",""Wang, S."",""Yao, W."",""Zeng, Y."",""Zhang, S.""}","10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02781",2024-07-16 23:11:05,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{}","{Biodiversity,""Conservation area identification"",""Ecological remote sensing"",""Habitat assessment"",""Sustainable development""}"
6863355,"Mapping Property Redevelopment Via Geoai: Integrating Computer Vision And Socioenvironmental Patterns And Processes","Domain knowledge of social and environmental sciences is generally derived from less structured small data and/or small models. The integration of deep learning with socioenvironmental and geographical patterns and processes is still in an early phase. This study proposes a flexible framework that synthesizes computer vision with patterns and processes of geographical phenomena (e.g., urban redevelopment) via deep convolutional neural networks and spatiotemporal neighborhoods, respectively. Meanwhile, undesirable visual cues (e.g., temporary objects such as cars) cause false alarms in urban change detection. Thus, a masked deep pyramid similarity model (i.e., the computer vision model) is proposed to minimize the negative impact of nonbuilding changes. This pipeline has robustness against obfuscation of undesirable street scene changes and elasticity of geographical knowledge representations in mapping property redevelopment. This model is reproducible and adaptable due to the wide availability of SVI and flexibility of the framework. The results suggest that the domain-driven rules and nonbuilding change masking mechanism can significantly increase the accuracy of a computer vision model. We also find that urban redevelopment should be understood as a locally tuned back-to-the-city process with weak replicability. Hybrid gentrification (i.e., the combination of “seesaw” gentrification and continuous gentrification) is observed globally with local variations. Takeaway for practice: First, the population of those affected should be carefully identified and the benefits of gentrification need to be redistributed on a larger scale. For Auckland, decision-makers should not divert attention away from low-income tenants in outer suburbs that slipped below the radar of local government and scholars. Second, more attention should be given to less resourcing neighborhoods in constantly gentrifying neighborhoods when governments formulate and implement housing subsidy policies. Locally, incessant redevelopment in Auckland CBD, New Market and Remuera, etc., should be contained. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","{""Liu, C."",""Song, W.""}","10.1016/j.cities.2023.104644",2024-09-30 02:17:18,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{""computer viz model""}","{""Auckland [Auckland (RGA)]"",""Auckland [North Island]"",""Deep learning"",Gentrification,""New Zealand"",""North Island"",""Physical urban change"",Regeneration,""Street view imagery"",""artificial neural network"",""computer simulation"",""housing policy"",""image analysis"",""machine learning"",""mapping method"",neighborhood,""numerical model"",""policy implementation"",redevelopment,""remote sensing"",""subsidy system"",""suburban area"",visualization}"
6691676,"Earth Observations as Decision Support for Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies in Response to Coastal Sea Level Rise","Local Sea Level (LSL) rise is among the major anticipated impacts of future global warming. Policy makers face a trade-off between imposing today the very high costs of mitigation, adaptation, and coastal protection upon national economies and leaving the costs of major disasters for future generations. Predictions of future LSL trajectories with reliable estimates of uncertainties are a crucial input to risk and vulnerability assessments in support of informed decisions. Current aleatory uncertainties in observations related to past and current LSL variations combined with epistemic uncertainties in some of the global, regional and local processes forcing LSL changes produce a large range of plausible future LSL trajectories and weak estimates of uncertainties. Therefore, policy makers often lack sound scientific support for the development of reasonable mitigation and adaptation strategies in the coastal zone. Additional spaceborne and in situ observations are needed in order to improve decision support by reducing the uncertainties in LSL predictions.","{""Plag, Hans-Peter""}","http://hpplag.com/publications/pubs/2009_plag_lsl_isrse_paper.pdf",2024-04-26 19:07:36,"excluded","{""Value is not measured"",""Data is not valued""}",2009,"{}","{""Sea level rise|Climate change impact|Risk assessment|Decision support""}"

The protocols discussed and the extensive number of case studies help environmental engineers to quickly identify the correct process for projects under study. The book is divided into four parts; each of the first three covers a separate environment: Geosphere, Atmosphere, and Hydrosphere. The first part covers ground assessment, contamination, geo-statistics, remote sensing, GIS, risk assessment and management, and environmental impact assessment. The second part covers atmospheric assessment topics, including the dynamics of contaminant transport, impacts of global warming, indoor and outdoor techniques and practice. The third part is dedicated to the hydrosphere including both the marine and fresh water environments. Finally, part four examines emerging issues in pollution assessment, from nanomaterials to artificial intelligence. There are a wide variety of case studies in the book to help bridge the gap between concept and practice.

6862824,"The Impact Of Time Separation On Coordination In Global Software Teams: A Conceptual Foundation","While there has been much research on the study of global virtual teams and global software teams, there has been practically no research on the nuances of time separation. We present three converging perspectives on this topic: (a) a view from practices and tactics of global teams; (b) a theoretical view from coordination theories; and (c) a view from our prior research in which we modeled coordination costs for time-separated dyads. Practice suggests that time separation arises not only from time-zone differences but also from factors such as nonoverlapping weekend days and holidays, shifts, and different working schedules. It also suggests that teams employ various coping tactics when faced with time separation - synchronous, asynchronous, and education. Theory suggests that communication is necessary to coordinate and that effectiveness of communication is hampered, both in quality and timeliness, when teams are separated by time. Our model, based on coordination theory, suggests that coordination costs contain four main components - communication, clarification, delay, and rework - and that the various aspects of time-separated work have different effects on each of these components. Our convergent view from these three perspectives shows that distance separation is symmetric - i.e. distance (A,B) = distance (B,A) - while time separation is asymmetric, which affects the planning of team interactions; that the timing of activities matters in time-separated contexts but not in contexts with only distance separation; and that vulnerability costs (i.e. resolving misunderstandings and rework) increase with time separation.

6863146,"Topographic Diversity As An Indicator For Resilience Of Terrestrial Protected Areas Against Climate Change","Habitat loss from unrelenting human pressure is causing an unprecedented decline in global biodiversity. Protected areas (PAs) are meant to counteract loss and fragmentation of ecosystems and today PAs form the backbone of conservation strategies worldwide. However, anthropogenic climate change can severely reduce the effectiveness of PAs. Conservation professionals are in need of concrete spatial information on climatic changes within PAs in order to put forward practicable strategies to safeguard PA effectiveness in the face of climate change. In this study, we take advantage of openly accessible data on the disappearing climate index (DCI) to examine which PA characteristics are linked to climate change resilience on a global scale. DCI provides a measure of the relative area (percent of total area) within a PA that exhibits certain climatic conditions that will either disappear entirely or move outside the boundaries of the PA by the year 2070. Our results show that topographic diversity is highly correlated with reduced climate change impacts in PAs worldwide. We analyzed three different PA characteristics representing topographic diversity: PA area, maximal elevational difference (MED) and median terrain ruggedness (TR). All three characteristics are highly correlated with a decrease in the disappearing climate index (DCI). These results hold true across localities and even PA management practices. IUCN management category IV (habitat/species management area) and V (protected landscape/seascape) exhibit on average the highest DCI values. As an indicator for PA resilience under climate change, topographic diversity can be assessed easily through publicly available data and remote sensing products. This ease-of-use leaves topographic diversity standing in marked contrast to overall environmental diversity as an actionable conservation metric. Of course, topographic diversity alone is not a sufficient criterion on which to base conservation decisions. However, neither should the potential usefulness of topographic diversity be underestimated. As an actionable and complementary metric in combination with biological information topographic diversity can be an exceptional tool for decision making by PA managers, conservation practitioners and politicians.

6863390,"Potential For Return On Investment In Rehabilitation-Oriented Blue Carbon Projects: Accounting Methodologies And Project Strategies","Opportunities to boost climate change mitigation and adaptation (CCMA) and sustainable conservation financing may lie in enhancing blue carbon sequestration, particularly in developing nations where coastal ecosystems are extensive and international carbon markets offer comparatively attractive payments for environmental stewardship. While blue carbon is receiving increased global attention, few credit-generating projects are operational, due to low credit-buyer incentives with uncertainty in creditable emissions reductions and high project costs. Little empirical guidance exists for practitioners to quantify return-on-investment (ROI) and viability of potential projects, particularly for rehabilitation where multiple implementation options exist with diverse associated costs. We map and model drivers of mangrove natural regeneration (NR) using remote sensing (high-resolution satellite imagery segmentation and time-series modeling), and subsequent carbon sequestration using field- and literature-derived data, across abandoned aquaculture ponds in the Philippines. Using project-specific cost data, we then assess ROI for a hypothetical rehabilitation-focused mangrove blue carbon project at a 9.68 ha abandoned pond over a 10-year timeframe, under varied rehabilitation scenarios {[}NR vs. assisted natural regeneration (ANR) with planting], potential emissions reduction accreditation methodologies, carbon prices and discount rates. NR was faster in lower-lying ponds with lower tidal exposure (greater pond dike retention). Forecasted carbon sequestration was 3.7- to 5.2-fold and areal ""greenbelt"" regeneration 2.5- to 3.4-fold greater in our case study under ANR than NR. Variability in modeled sequestration rates drove high uncertainty and credit deductions in NR strategies. ROI with biomass-only accreditation was low and negative under NR and ANR, respectively. ROI was greater under ANR with inclusion of biomass and autochthonous soil carbon; however, neither strategy was highly profitable at current voluntary market carbon prices. ANR was the only scenario that fulfilled coastal protection greenbelt potential, with full mangrove cover within 10 years. Our findings highlight the benefits of ANR and soils inclusion in rehabilitation-oriented blue carbon projects, to maximize carbon sequestration and greenbelt enhancement (thus enhance pricing with potential bundled credits), and minimize forecasting uncertainty and credit-buyers' perceived risk. An ANR rehabilitation strategy in low-lying, sea-facing abandoned ponds with low biophysical intervention costs may represent large blue carbon CCMA opportunities in regions with high aquaculture abandonment.","{""Duncan, Clare"",""Hill, Nicholas A.

6862830,"Feasibility Study Of Using Crowdsourcing To Identify Critical Affected Areas For Rapid Damage Assessment: Hurricane Matthew Case Study","The rapid damage assessment plays a critical role in crisis management. Collection of timely information for rapid damage assessment is particularly challenging during natural disasters. Remote sensing technologies were used for data collection during disasters. However, due to the large areas affected by major disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, specific data cannot be collected in time such as the location information. Social media can serve as a crowdsourcing platform for citizens' communication and information sharing during natural disasters and provide the timely data for identifying affected areas to support rapid damage assessment during disasters. Nevertheless, there is very limited existing research on the utility of social media data in damage assessment. Even though some investigation of the relationship between social media activities and damages was conducted, the employment of damage-related social media data in exploring the fore-mentioned relationship remains blank. This paper, for the first time, establishes the index dictionary by semantic analysis for the identification of damage-related tweets posted during Hurricane Matthew in Florida. Meanwhile, the insurance claim data from the publication of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is used as a representative of real hurricane damage data in Florida. This study performs a correlation analysis and a comparative analysis of the geographic distribution of social media data and damage data at the county level in Florida. We find that employing social media data to identify critical affected areas at the county level during disasters is viable. Damage data has a closer relationship with damage-related tweets than disaster-related tweets.","{""Liu, Rui"",""Yuan, Faxi""}","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2018.02.003",2024-07-17 21:23:47,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2018,"{""social media not rs""}","{""Damage assessment; Data mining; Semantic analysis; Social media; Crowdsourcing; Case study""}"
6863647,"Spatial Planning For Biodiversity Conservation: Assessment Of Forest Landscapes' Conservation Value Using Umbrella Species Requirements In Poland","Maintenance of biodiversity requires spatial planning for the conservation of species habitats. In this study, the distribution of the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in Poland was used to assess the usefulness of a demographic model compared to an area-based model for predicting the occurrence of breeding pairs in local landscapes. The models were applied to the European Forest Map and to CORINE land cover data, two spatial databases derived from remote sensing. We tested the performance of the models by comparing predicted occurrence of the species with actual occurrence in 10 km x 10 km of the Polish Ornithological Atlas Database (POAD). Both models proved useful for identifying areas with high potential for hosting breeding woodpeckers. However, the demographic model performed consistently better at predicting the presence of at least one breeding pair in local landscapes. In north-eastern and south-eastern Poland, expected occurrences coincided with the actual occurrence of the species according to POAD. In north-western Poland, however, occurrence was predicted but not confirmed by the atlas data. The eastern regions are situated at the border to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. These countries hold large areas of high conservation value forests and large populations of White-backed Woodpecker. This pattern evokes the need for cross-border governance, and planning with an eco-regional perspective that considers both EU and non-EU countries. Moreover, the results stress the need to incorporate population requirements when assessing the distribution of forests with high conservation value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

6863424,"Monitoring Wind Farms Occupying Grasslands Based On Remote-Sensing Data From China's Gf-2 Hd Satellite—A Case Study Of Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, China","Wind power is a clean and renewable resource, and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer. However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km2 per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m2 of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m2 and 2496 m2, respectively. Approximately 2.44 km2 of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. In this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","{""Chen, S."",""Guo, J."",""Jin, Y."",""Liu, H."",""Shen, G."",""Xu, B."",""Yang, X."",""Zhang, W."",""Zhang, Y.""}","10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.06.026",2024-07-12 19:28:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2017,"{}","{""Average difference"",China,""China's GF-2 HD satellite"",""Construction equipment"",""Decision making"",""Electric utilities"",Farms,Gansu,""Gansu province"",""Grassland monitoring"",Jiuquan,Landsat,Planning,""Remote sensing data"",""Remote sensing images"",""Remote sensing tools"",""Renewable resource"",Satellites,""Sustainable development"",""Vegetation destruction"",""Wind farm"",""Wind power"",""Wind turbines"",""agricultural land"",destruction,grassland,human,monitoring,""remote sensing"",""satellite data"",""satellite imagery"",""soil erosion"",vegetation}"
6863251,"Wetlands: An Overview","While many indigenous people and rural populations still depend on local wetlands and waters for their livelihood (e.g., Schuyt 2005), most if not all nations now recognize wetlands as one of the world’s most valuable natural resources. Besides their intrinsic value to specially adapted plants and animals, wetlands produce a wealth of environmental services that directly benefit human societies (Table 1.1). Given this recognition, there has been increasing attention given to wetland conservation around the globe (e.g., Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Wetlands have been acquired as nature preserves, sanctuaries, and wildlife management areas or identified as globally important for water birds or vital for storing carbon to help ameliorate the effect of human-induced greenhouse gases on atmospheric temperature. Wetland restoration has become a subject for scientific investigation as well as for commercial enterprise. Some governments have enacted laws and/or policies to protect wetlands or regulate conversion of these valued resources and initiated wetland inventories to aid wetland management and conservation. Since this book focuses on advances in remote sensing technology to perform such inventories, a brief overview of wetlands seems warranted. This chapter is intended to provide that introduction and includes a list of references for readers to gain a more complete understanding of wetlands. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","{""Tiner, R.

6863623,"The Annual Cycle For Whimbrel Populations Using The Western Atlantic Flyway","Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring. The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground, arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high (98\%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes. The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high conservation value.","{""Duval, Laura"",""Hamilton, Diana J."",""Hines, Chance"",""Keyes, Tim"",""Paquet, Julie"",""Pirie-Dominix, Lisa"",""Rausch, Jennie"",""Smith, Fletcher M."",""Truitt, Barry"",""Watts, Bryan D."",""Winn, Brad"",""Woodard, Paul""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0260339",2024-10-03 17:33:39,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}",NA
6862924,"Impact Of Landscape Patterns On Ecosystem Services In China: A Case Study Of The Central Plains Urban Agglomeration","Urban agglomeration is the highest stage of urban development, which reasonable planning will be conducive to the rapid and healthy development of the regional economy. However, in recent years, unreasonable urban agglomeration planning has changed landscape patterns and brought huge challenges to ecosystem services. Moreover, there is currently a lack of understanding of the relationship between landscape patterns and ecosystem services, especially in the process of urban agglomeration construction. In this study, we attempt to reveal the impact of landscape patterns on ecosystem services value (ESV) based on many years of remote sensing data in the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA). The results show that landscape patterns have significant spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, and there are significant differences between different landscape patterns in the CPUA. Moreover, most of landscape patterns show significant east-west differences. Total ESV has decreased from USD 838.53 million in 2000 to USD 792.32 million in 2018. From a spatial perspective, the areas with high ESV are mostly distributed in the western mountainous and southern hilly areas, but low ESV area are mainly concentrated in the central and northern plains. In addition, the results of model analysis reveal that there is a remarkable positive correlation between ESV and patch density, interspersion juxtaposition index, cohesion index, and splitting index, but a remarkable negative correlation between ESV and total edge. These results provide critical guidance and suggestions for the improvement of future urban agglomeration construction.

6447816,"Spatial and Temporal Dynamics and Value of Nature-Based Recreation, Estimated via Social Media","Conserved lands provide multiple ecosystem services, including opportunities for nature-based recreation. Managing this service requires understanding the landscape attributes underpinning its provision, and how changes in land management affect its contribution to human wellbeing over time. However, evidence from both spatially explicit and temporally dynamic analyses is scarce, often due to data limitations. In this study, we investigated nature-based recreation within conserved lands in Vermont, USA. We used geotagged photographs uploaded to the photo-sharing website Flickr to quantify visits by in-state and out-of-state visitors, and we multiplied visits by mean trip expenditures to show that conserved lands contributed US $1.8 billion (US $0.18–20.2 at 95% confidence) to Vermont’s tourism industry between 2007 and 2014. We found eight landscape attributes explained the pattern of visits to conserved lands; visits were higher in larger conserved lands, with less forest cover, greater trail density and more opportunities for snow sports. Some of these attributes differed from those found in other locations, but all aligned with our understanding of recreation in Vermont. We also found that using temporally static models to inform conservation decisions may have perverse outcomes for nature-based recreation. For example, static models suggest conserved land with less forest cover receive more visits, but temporally dynamic models suggest clearing forests decreases, rather than increases, visits to these sites. Our results illustrate the importance of understanding both the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services for conservation decision-making.","{""Ricketts, Taylor H."",""Sonter, Laura J."",""Watson, Keri B."",""Wood, Spencer A.""}","10.1371/journal.pone.0162372",NA,NA,NA,2016,"{}","{""Conservation science"",Forests,""Land use"",Recreation,Sports,Swimming,Towns,Vermont}"
6863235,"Assessing The Cooling Effect Of Blue-Green Spaces: Implications For Urban Heat Island Mitigation","The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a significant concern in today’s rapidly urbanising cities, with exacerbating heatwaves’ impact, urban livelihood, and environmental well-being. This study aims to assess the cooling effect of blue-green spaces in Bhubaneswar, India, and explore their implications for mitigating UHI effects. Satellite images were processed with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce information on the blue-green spaces’ land surface temperatures (LST). The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were employed to quantify the presence and characteristics of these blue-green spaces. The findings revealed significant spatial variations in the LST, with higher temperatures observed in bare land and built-up areas and lower temperatures in proximity to the blue-green spaces. In addition, a correlation analysis indicated the strong influence of the built-up index (NDBI) on the LST, emphasising the impact of urbanisation on local climate dynamics. The analysis demonstrated the potential of blue-green spaces in reducing surface temperatures and mitigating UHI effects. Based on these results, strategic interventions were proposed, such as increasing the coverage of green spaces, optimising access to water bodies, and integrating water-sensitive design principles into urban planning to enhance the cooling effects and foster a more sustainable and resilient urban environment. This study highlighted the importance of leveraging remote sensing and GEE for urban UHI analyses. It provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to prioritise nature-based solutions for heat mitigation in Bhubaneswar and other similar cities. Future research could delve deeper into a quantitative assessment of the cooling benefits of specific blue-green infrastructure interventions and explore their socio-economic impacts on urban communities. © 2023 by the authors.","{""Garg, R.

6863430,"Dairy Farming In The Eastern Himalayan Foothills: Perspectives From The Lower Dibang Valley, India","Dairying in the far-flung rural areas of Arunachal Pradesh in the Eastern Himalayas forms an important source of livelihood. The Himalayan foothill region of Lower Dibang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh, India is dotted with dairy farming units, locally known as Khutti (cowsheds). The semi-pastoral traditional practice of dairying among the Nepali community has its own economic, geographical and social ramifications. The khuttis or the goths (dairy units) move from one place to another depending on fodder availability and seasonality. This chapter seeks to identify the cost and production, price and profitability of dairying livelihood; the status of livelihood of the dairy farming households and its relationship with the changing climatic conditions in the study area. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the study. Primary data was collected with the help of structured survey schedule. A handheld geographical positioning system (GPS) device was used to derive accurate longitudinal and latitudinal positions of the dairy farms and other features. Topographic maps and satellite imageries were used for the construction of maps. A simple cost-benefit analysis was carried out to assess the cost and profitability of the dairy units. Generally the households manage to stay marginally above the poverty level, with the standards of living being generally low. Buffaloes tended to provide better returns from dairying than cows. The markedly traditional mode of dairying has aided the gradual improvement of the livelihood of the dairying community although their tenuous existence could be undermined by climate change in the coming years.

6863240,"Use Of Hedgerows By Mammals In An Intensive Agricultural Landscape","Agricultural intensification causes habitat modification, sometimes leading to habitat loss and subsequent loss of connectivity. Remaining species in these agriculture-dominated landscapes often use hedgerows, such as windbreaks or riparian strips, as movement corridors or even as habitats. However, the understanding of the use of these hedgerows by mammals is limited and could be improved with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, which are unbiased, detailed and repeatable. The aim of this study was to assess the attributes that affect medium- and large-sized mammals' use of hedgerows, with in situ and remotely sensed data (including LiDAR and multispectral images) in an agriculture-dominated landscape in southern Quebec. Twenty-three hedgerows were selected and characterized with both field surveys and remote sensing analyses, like LiDAR metrics and vegetation indices. Wildlife frequentation of each hedgerow was measured using camera traps, from late spring to early fall in 2018. 431 mammal detections were obtained among all 23 hedgerows. From this, seven species were recorded, all of them opportunistic and well adapted to agricultural environment. Results showed significant differences in mammal use of hedgerows. Coefficients of the better-ranked models based on AICc indicated a positive relationship between hedgerow length and their use by mammals, and a negative relationship with the hedgerow width. Hedgerow use by mammals also increased as tree cover and understory density increased, and as human disturbance decreased. These results characterized for the first time the variables influencing hedgerow use by a broad set of medium- and large-sized mammal species and confirmed their use as movement corridors and/or habitat. This study also confirmed the complementary usefulness of variables derived from remote sensing combined with field data. The low explanatory power of variables often cited in the literature (e.g. NDVI, gappiness) also highlights the need to further explore their specific influence on mammals. The information provided by this study supports the beneficial role played by hedgerows for wildlife conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes. Management guidelines are provided as well as future research avenues.","{""Dupras, J."",""Pelletier-Guittier, C."",""Theau, J.""}","10.1016/j.agee.2020.107079",2024-07-17 21:26:26,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2020,"{}","{""Hedgerow; Agricultural landscape; Mammal; Remote sensing; Conservation""}"
6903478,"A Survey Of Blockchain-Based Strategies For Healthcare","Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons. © 2020 ACM.",NA,"10.1145/3376915",2024-09-27 23:18:53,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{spurious}",NA
6863616,"Forest And Land Fires, Toxic Haze And Local Politics In Indonesia","Forest and land fires are among the major catastrophic events that occur in Indonesia. They are a major cause of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Their multiple sources are most diverse and root in nature and society. The immediate fire effects directly and the long-term landscape ecosystem degradations indirectly cause major and persisting and serious problems of public health and ecosystem service. Smoke haze from the forest and land fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2015 caused significant environmental and economic losses in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. We describe the different types of land uses and land cover where fires and smoke haze took place, and how local politics have affected fire use from 2001 to 2017. We calculated hot spots from satellite imageries as proxies for fire occurrences and applied regression analysis to understand the link between fire and local politics in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47\%), followed by conservation areas (31\%) and community land (22\%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics. Their frequency and abundance obviously increased about a year prior to local elections. The reasons behind the correlation need to be understood so that appropriate incentives and sanctions can be put in place and deter political leaders from using fire as an incentive to their advantage.","{""Achdiawan, R."",""Dermawan, A."",""Dewayani, A.

6863607,"An Evaluation Of The Economic Viability Of Environmental Offsets In The Saltworks Industry","The extraction of sea salt depends on the occupation of large areas at the estuary banks, many of them inserted in Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs). Thus, the objective was to evaluate the economic viability of Environmental Offsets (EO) as an alternative to the unoccupied PPAs in the saltworks. In order to do so, 27 solar saltworks installed in the region of the Brazilian White Coast were evaluated for the occupation of PPAs-measured using images from satellite, georeferenced, vectored with corresponding PPA bands generated-and estimated to EO (Impact Degree x Sum of the investments necessary to implement the project) and Economic Impact (Net Present Value, with long-term interest rate of 7%) of vacating PPAs. It was considered that EO was feasible whenever the costs resulting from it were lower than the economic impact caused by the vacancy of the PPAs. The PPAs were tthe productive area of ​the saltworksthat occupied 13.70% of PPAs. For all the evaluated enterprises the value corresponding to EO was lower than the Economic Impact resulting from the vacancy of the PPAs. Thus, EO is an economically viable and more attractive alternative to the eviction of PPAs by the saltworks industry and may also provide environmental gains due to the financing of conservation units in the areas of influence of the enterprises. However, there is a need to improve the methodology used to estimate the EO, since a maximum limit is set, the environmental impacts caused by the projects are underestimated. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

6903506,"Seasonal Forecasts For The Limpopo Province In Estimating Deviations From Grazing Capacity","Application of seasonal forecasts in agriculture has significant potential and realized utility. Other sectors that may also benefit from using seasonal forecasts include (but are not limited to) health, hydrology, water, and energy. This paper shows that seasonal forecast model data, satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), dry matter productivity (DMP) data (proxy of grass biomass) along with other sets of data are effectively used to estimate grazing capacity (GC) over a 12-year test period (1998/1999–2009/2010) in Limpopo Province. GC comprises a vital consideration in agricultural activities, particularly for a province in South Africa like Limpopo, due to its varying climate. The Limpopo Province capitalizes on subsistence farming, including livestock and crop production. Grazing should thus be regulated in order to conserve grass, shrubs, and trees, thereby ensuring sustainability of rangelands. In a statistical downscaling model, the predictor is the 850 geopotential height fields of a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation (CGCM) over Southern Africa to predict seasonal DMP values. This model shows that the mid-summer rainfall totals are important predictors for the November through April (NDJFMA) DMP (as well as grazing capacity) growing season. Forecast verification is conducted using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and reliability diagrams. The CGCM model shows skill in discriminating high and low DMP (GC) seasons in the Limpopo Province, as well as reliability in the probabilistic forecasts. This paper demonstrates the development of a tailored forecast, an avenue that should be explored in enhancing relevance of forecasts in agricultural production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",NA,"10.1007/s00704-018-2696-x",2024-10-03 21:48:10,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA
6863501,"Measurement Of Snow Depth Using A Low-Cost Mobile Laser Scanner","In this letter, we demonstrate the potential of a small, robust, and low-cost mobile scanner for snow-depth studies. Snow-surface model and depth data are needed for purposes such as flood forecasting, agriculture, optimal management of water resources, and in formulating global climate-change scenarios. Traditionally, manual snow-depth measurements are laborious, time-consuming, and costly. A mobile mapping system comprised of an Ibeo Lux laser scanner, operating at a wavelength of 905 nm, and a NovAtel SPAN-CPT inertial navigation system was used to produce geo-referenced point clouds. The data were acquired first in the fall when the ground was free of snow and then a second time in winter when there was snow on the ground. Reference values from a total of 94 locations were collected with an RTK GPS pole. The maximum reference snow depth was 80 cm. The obtained snow-depth bias was 0.3 cm, which indicated that the proposed data-processing approach was capable of avoiding errors due to laser penetration into the snow, and the root-mean-squared error was 5.5 cm. Mobile laser scanning appears to be a promising technology for cryospheric studies having potential, e.g., to calibrate gravimetric measurements and earth observation satellite data, especially when reference data are needed for areas that are too large for terrestrial laser scanning.","{""Hyyppa, Juha"",""Jaakkola, Anttoni"",""Puttonen, Eetu""}","10.1109/lgrs.2013.2271861",2024-07-19 20:44:31,"excluded","{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}",2014,"{""portable laser scanner""}","{""Digital elevation models (DEMs); laser radar; remote sensing; snow depth; terrain mapping""}"
6863643,"S2net: A Multitask Learning Network For Semantic Stereo Of Satellite Image Pairs","Stereo matching and semantic segmentation are two significant tasks in remote sensing. Recently, deep learning approaches have been applied to these tasks separately. However, the lack of semantic supervision makes the training of stereo matching model susceptible to data disturbance, resulting in inferior generalization ability; foreground objects are sometimes confused with background pixels in RGB images, limiting the classification accuracy. By exploring the relationship between these two tasks, semantic stereo solves these problems simultaneously with multitask learning. Previous methods took semantic stereo as two parallel processing tasks, so they did not take full advantages of the additional information from both tasks and only obtained slight improvement. In this work, we designed a multitask learning framework semantic stereo network (S2Net). The proposed network generates cost volumes with feature maps supervised by semantic information to estimate disparity maps and fuses RGB-D feature maps to predict classification maps, therefore gathering multitask learning information. To enhance the performance of trained model, we also considered the continuity of disparity values and the duality of stereo image pairs in data augmentation. When applied in datasets without training, S2Net obtained 2.937% D1-Error in the WHU dataset, lower than 4.297% of the previous best method, depicting the generalization ability improvement from semantic supervision. In terms of semantic segmentation, the introduction of disparity maps increases the mean intersection over union (mIoU) from 61.375% to 69.096% in the US3D datasets. The experiments on the KITTI semantics benchmark show that our proposed method obtains 60.76% mIoU, achieving state-of-the-art among multitask learning methods . © 1980-2012 IEEE.","{""Chen, G."",""He, C."",""Li, X."",""Liao, P."",""Wang, Q."",""Wang, T."",""Yang, H."",""Zhang, X."",""Zhou, W.""}","10.1109/tgrs.2023.3335997",2024-07-19 20:11:00,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""Data is not valued""}",2024,"{calibration}","{""Classification (of information)"",""Convolutional neural network"",""Cost benefit analysis"",""Deep learning"",""Feature map"",""Features extraction"",""Generalization ability"",""Neural networks"",""Remote sensing"",""Semantic Web"",Semantics,""Stereo image processing"",Stereo-matching,""Task analysis"",""accuracy assessment"",""artificial neural network"",""machine learning"",""multitask learning"",pixel,""satellite imagery"",segmentation,""semantic segmentation"",""semantic standardization"",""stereo image"",""stereo image pairs"",""stereo matching""}"
6903560,"Quantitative Catchment Profiling To Apportion Faecal Indicator Organism Budgets For The Ribble System, The Uk's Sentinel Drainage Basin For Water Framework Directive Research","Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20/60/EC and the US Federal Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within river drainage basins has shifted from traditional point-source control to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive (BWD), under the list of 'protected areas' in the WFD places a requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within catchments in order to achieve the objectives of both the BWD (and its revision - 2006/7/EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44-day period during the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90\% of the total organism load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However, during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater retention tanks. The study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure and WwTW stormwater retention tanks as the dominant component of the high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde coast and the associated bathing waters.

Using remote sensing data, this study provides detailed land use maps of the Lower Chenab Canal irrigated region of Pakistan from 2005 to 2012 for LULC change detection. Major crop types are demarcated by identifying temporal profiles of NDVI using MODIS 250 m x 250 m spatial resolution data. Wheat and rice are found to be major crops in rabi and kharif seasons, respectively. Accuracy assessment of prepared maps is performed using three different techniques: error matrix approach, comparison with ancillary data and with previous study. Producer and user accuracies for each class are calculated along with kappa coefficients (K). The average overall accuracies for rabi and kharif are 82.83\% and 78.21\%, respectively. Producer and user accuracies for individual class range respectively between 72.5\% to 77\% and 70.1\% to 84.3\% for rabi and 76.6\% to 90.2\% and 72\% to 84.7\% for kharif. The K values range between 0.66 to 0.77 for rabi with average of 0.73, and from 0.69 to 0.74 with average of 0.71 for kharif. LULC change detection indicates that wheat and rice have less volatility of change in comparison with. both rabi and kharif fodders. Transformation between cotton and rice is less common due to their completely different cropping conditions. Results of spatial and temporal LULC distributions and their seasonal variations provide useful insights for establishing realistic LULC scenarios for hydrological studies.","{""Abbas, A."",""Liedl, R."",""Shahid, M.

6863086,"Slope Instabilities In Steep Cultivation Systems: Process Classification And Opportunities From Remote Sensing","The cultivation of steep slopes is a widespread practice in hilly and mountainous areas around the world. Such environments often result in particular agricultural systems linked with unique local values of historical and cultural heritage, economy, and food security. However, steep-slope agriculture is inherently exposed to slope instability processes, which are now widely aggravated due to natural (e.g., growing rainfall aggressiveness) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., unsuitable maintenance or agronomic practices). In the literature, among the many articles published on soil erosion, a specific focus on the analysis of slope instabilities in steep cultivation systems is lacking. The purpose of this article is, therefore, to create a specific overview of this problem, with some useful insights into the role of remote sensing. We introduce the problem first, highlighting the main issues related to slope instabilities in steep cultivated areas. Then we provided a classification of key published papers, based on the different types of mass movements studied and their location in the world. The spatial comparison of past research and estimated global hazard of the mass movement in agricultural areas highlighted a relevant bias: a strong scientific focus on southern European countries, yet large rural areas are at risk on all continents, many of these unexplored by science. The third section is related to the contribution of remote sensing technologies (e.g., LiDAR and RPAS photogrammetry) in mapping the investigated processes. This study could help to guide future research for better management of such socio-economically relevant agricultural landscapes.","{""Cucchiaro, Sara"",""Pijl, Anton"",""Tarolli, Paolo"",""Wei, Wei""}","10.1002/ldr.3798",2024-07-18 21:05:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""agriculture; landslides; remote sensing; slope instabilities; steep landscapes; terraces""}"
6903639,"A New Temperature-Vegetation Triangle Algorithm With Variable Edges (Tave) For Satellite-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation","The estimation of spatially-variable actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a critical challenge to regional water resources management. We propose a new remote sensing method, the Triangle Algorithm with Variable Edges (TAVE), to generate daily AET estimates based on satellite-derived land surface temperature and the vegetation index NDVI. The TAVE captures heterogeneity in AET across elevation zones and permits variability in determining local values of wet and dry end-member classes (known as edges). Compared to traditional triangle methods, TAVE introduces three unique features: (i) the discretization of the domain as overlapping elevation zones; (ii) a variable wet edge that is a function of elevation zone; and (iii) variable values of a combined-effect parameter (that accounts for aerodynamic and surface resistance, vapor pressure gradient, and soil moisture availability) along both wet and dry edges. With these features, TAVE effectively addresses the combined influence of terrain and water stress on semi-arid environment AET estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in one of the driest countries in the worldJordan, and compare it to a traditional triangle method (TA) and a global AET product (MOD16) over different land use types. In irrigated agricultural lands, TAVE matched the results of the single crop coefficient model (-3\%), in contrast to substantial overestimation by TA (+234\%) and underestimation by MOD16 (-50\%). In forested (non-irrigated, water consuming) regions, TA and MOD16 produced AET average deviations 15.5 times and -3.5 times of those based on TAVE. As TAVE has a simple structure and low data requirements, it provides an efficient means to satisfy the increasing need for evapotranspiration estimation in data-scarce semi-arid regions. This study constitutes a much needed step towards the satellite-based quantification of agricultural water consumption in Jordan.",NA,"10.3390/rs8090735",2024-09-27 23:32:43,"excluded","{Validation/calibration}",NA,"{}",NA

In this study, we provided complete-coverage PM2.5 predictions with a 1 km spatial resolution from 2000 to the present under the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/, last access: 3 October 2022) framework. To support high spatial resolution modeling, we collected PM2.5 measurements from both national and local monitoring stations. To correctly reflect the temporal variations in land cover characteristics that affected the local variations in PM2.5, we constructed continuous annual geoinformation datasets, including the road maps and ensemble gridded population maps, in China from 2000 to 2021. We also examined various model structures and predictor combinations to balance the computational cost and model performance. The final model fused 10 km TAP PM2.5 predictions from our previous work, 1 km satellite aerosol optical depth retrievals, and land use parameters with a random forest model. Our annual model had an out-of-bag R-2 ranging between 0.80 and 0.84, and our hindcast model had a by-year cross-validation R-2 of 0.76.

6862831,"Time-Series Analysis Of Landsat-Mss/Tm/Oli Images Over Amazonian Waters Impacted By Gold Mining Activities","Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapajós River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapajós River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapajós aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","{""Costa, M.

6863528,"Artificial Intelligence Based Methods For Smart And Sustainable Urban Planning: A Systematic Survey","The world’s cities are facing various challenges such as rapid urbanization, poverty, climate change, pollution, sustainable and inclusive development. Building futuristic smart and sustainable cities is proving to be a response to these challenges. Recent publications show that urban planning decision support is increasingly using artificial intelligence through machine learning methods to address these challenges. 172 papers were published in 2020 compared to 8 before 2010 with a forecast of at least 200 papers in 2021. Despite the explosive number of scientific publications on applications artificial intelligence for urban planning decision support, few studies have made a systematic assessment of the state of the art to inform future research. This would help focus on the approaches used, the planning problems most commonly addressed, the data used and even the study areas. We found that the top 5 most addressed urban planning issues include: land use/cover, urban growth, urban buildings, urban mobility and urban environment. Furthermore, a large amount of data was used from sensors and simple or ensemble machine learning methods were more used in this case. Deep learning methods are more used for land use/cover, buildings and climate issues which are mostly based on satellite image data. On the other hand, China and the United States are the most studied territories while Africa is almost not. A high intensity of collaboration between researchers affiliated with Chinese, American and English institutions was observed. Thus, urban planning researchers should benefit from this synthesis work by understanding the general idea of the application of machine learning methods in urban planning, its trends, issues, current challenges and future research directions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).","{""Azmi, R."",""Chenal, J."",""Diop, E.

6691723,"Fire and smoke observed from the Earth Observing System MODIS instrument-products, validation, and operational use","The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, launched on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra satellite at the end of 1999, was designed with 36 spectral channels for a wide array of land, ocean, and atmospheric investigations. MODIS has a unique ability to observe fires, smoke, and burn scars globally. Its main fire detection channels saturate at high brightness temperatures: 500 K at 4 µm and 400 K at 11 µm, which can only be attained in rare circumstances at the 1 km fire detection spatial resolution. Thus, unlike other polar orbiting satellite sensors with similar thermal and spatial resolutions, but much lower saturation temperatures (e.g. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Along Track Scanning Radiometer), MODIS can distinguish between low intensity ground surface fires and high intensity crown forest fires. Smoke column concentration over land is for the first time being derived from the MODIS solar channels, extending from 0.41 µm to 2.1 µm. The smoke product has been provisionally validated both globally and regionally over southern Africa and central and south America. Burn scars are observed from MODIS even in the presence of smoke, using the 1.2 to 2.1 µm channels. MODIS burned area information is used to estimate pyrogenic emissions. A wide range of these fire and related products and validation are demonstrated for the wild fires that occurred in northwestern USA in Summer 2000. The MODIS rapid response system and direct broadcast capability is being developed to enable users to obtain and generate data in near real-time. It is expected that health and land management organizations will use these systems for monitoring the occurrence of fires and the dispersion of smoke within two to six hours after data acquisition.","{""Kaufman, Y.J.""}","https://doi.org/10.1080/01431160210144741",2024-04-25 02:33:09,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2003,"{}",NA

These approaches have a variety of drawbacks including data latency, accurately prescribing irrigation intensity, and a lack of conservation of water volume for models using a prescribed soil moisture approach. In this study, we parameterize irrigation fluxes using satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) compared to ET from a suite of land surface models without irrigation. We then incorporate the irrigation flux into the Community Land Model (CLM) and use a systematic trial-and-error procedure to determine the ground- and surface-water withdrawals that are necessary to balance the new irrigation flux. The resulting CLM simulation with irrigation produces ET that matches the magnitude and seasonality of observed satellite ET well, with a mean difference of 6.3 mm month(-1) and a correlation of 0.95. Differences between the new CLM ET values and satellite-observed ET values are always less than 30 mm month(-1) and the differences show no pattern with respect to seasonality. The results reinforce the importance of accurately parameterizing anthropogenic hydrologic fluxes into land surface and climate models to assess environmental change under current and future climates and land management regimes.","{""Anderson, R.

6668588,"Information Technology And Public Health Management Of Disasters - A Model For South Asian Countries","This paper highlights the use of information technology (IT) in disaster management and public health management of disasters. Effective health response to disasters will depend on three important lines of action: (1) disaster preparedness; (2) emergency relief; and (3) management of disasters. This is facilitated by the presence of modern communication and space technology, especially the Internet and remote sensing satellites. This has made the use of databases, knowledge bases, geographic information systems (GIS), management information systems (MIS), information transfer, and online connectivity possible in the area of disaster management and medicine. This paper suggests a conceptual model called, ""The Model for Public Health Management of Disasters for South Asia"". This Model visualizes the use of IT in the public health management of disasters by setting up the Health and Disaster Information Network and Internet Community Centers, which will facilitate cooperation among all those in the areas of disaster management and emergency medicine. The suggested infrastructure would benefit the governments, non-government organizations, and institutions working in the areas of disaster and emergency medicine, professionals, the community, and all others associated with disaster management and emergency medicine. The creation of such an infrastructure will enable the rapid transfer of information, data, knowledge, and online connectivity from top officials to the grassroots organizations, and also among these countries regionally. This Model may be debated, modified, and tested further in the field to suit the national and local conditions. It is hoped that this exercise will result in a viable and practical model for use in public health management of disasters by South Asian countries.

6903620,"Variability Of Water Use Efficiency Associated With Climate Change In The Extreme West Of Bahia","Water has become more important in agricultural implementations over the years, as has the need for water management. Thus, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) has been used as an alternative form of detecting the variability of water management based on the carbon-water cycle. The study aimed to map and quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of WUE based on its interactions with environmental changes. It focused on an agricultural area in the westernmost region of Bahia, Northeast Brazil (NEB). For WUE estimation, data from Collection 6 MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Evapotranspiration (ET) products with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees were obtained from the Earth Explorer website. Subsequently, annual WUE anomalies were calculated based on the 2001-2019 period. The results obtained indicated that the highest values of GPP (580 gC/m(2)), ET (3000 mm), and WUE (3.5 gC/mm center dot m(2)) occurred in agricultural areas, associated with cultural treatments and insertion of irrigation, which helped in the higher WUE values and consequently increased agricultural productivity in the study region. In addition, there was a marked influence of the phases of the climate variability mode-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-on the annual variability of the WUE, with a reduction of 96\% during the La Nina of 2016 (an increase of 89\% during El Nino of 2005). During El Ninos, vegetation had greater efficiency resulting from the adaptation of vegetation in maintaining the carbon-water balance, using water more efficiently. However, unlike Las Ninas, with excessive precipitation there is an interference in the WUE, which interferes with the absorption of radiation and nutrients for the biophysical processes of vegetation and agriculture and, consequently, agricultural production. The use of WUE for agriculture is extremely important, especially for Brazil and countries with an economy based on primary production. This information on the way vegetation (native or agricultural) responds to interactions with the environment aids in decision-making about water management, possibly lowering losses or agricultural damage caused by a lack of water.",NA,"10.3390/su142316004",2024-09-27 22:34:16,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863479,"Integrated Studies To Identify Site-Specific Parameters For Environmentally Benign Mining Operations: A Case Study From The Sukari Gold Mine, Egypt","This study integrates observations from field and remote sensing data, along with geochemical and isotopic analyses, to assess the environmental impacts of cyanidation and mining activities in the Sukari gold mine (SGM), Eastern Desert, Egypt, in particular, and the orogenic gold deposits of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) in general. Our findings indicate: (1) groundwater flows south to north in the highly fractured basement aquifer related to the brittle deformation associated with the Najd Fault System; (2) massive gabbroic bodies separate the fractured basement aquifer into east and west conduits; (3) the tailings storage facility (TSF) pond and leach pad were constructed over the west conduit; and (4) cyanide-rich wastewater has leaked downward through tears and cuts in the lining of the TSF pond into the fractured aquifer and cyanide contaminants have migrated northward along the west conduit. Evidence for the latter includes: (1) toxic concentrations of cyanide (total: 0.018–9.4 mg/L; free weak-acid dissociable: 0.003–0.7 mg/L) were observed in groundwater samples north of the TSF pond; (2) similarities in electrical conductivity (EC) values and chloride/bromide (Cl−/Br−) ratios between groundwater north of the pond (EC: 88.8 mS/cm; Cl−/Br−: 346 to 363) and those of the TSF pond water (mean EC: 99 mS/cm; Cl−/Br−: 242 to 383) were observed; (3) the geochemical (e.g., sodium [Na+], Cl−) and isotopic compositions (δ18O and δ2H values) of groundwater are consistent with mixing of groundwater upgradient from the SGM with isotopically enriched pond water; and (4) cyanide contamination could not have resulted from an overflow of the TSF pond during flash flood events, given that rainfall is negligible and effective flood control systems are in place.

6863141,"The Spatial Pattern Of Scirpus Mariqueter Expansion And The Associated Mechanism Of Self-Organization Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles And Its Significance For Coastal Wetland Restoration","Understanding the spatial expansion process of salt marshes and quantifying the factors driving this expansion are crucial for the management and restoration of coastal wetlands. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the expansion process of Scirpus mariqueter using drone remote sensing and quantify its relationship with habitat quality. Our hypothesis was that landscape metrics could serve as valuable indicators for prioritizing habitat restoration efforts along the coast. We utilized drone remote sensing and adopted the simple Greenness Index to reflect the growth status of S. mariqueter. Using this index, we computed the standard deviation ellipse and growth center. To evaluate habitat quality, we developed a method based on our previous research and other relevant reports. We then conducted a quantitative analysis of the expansion process of S. mariqueter in areas with varying habitat quality. We found that S. mariqueter’s optimal elevation was 3.7 m, with a range of 2.5 to 4.3 m. The threshold value for soil total nitrogen was 0.3 g/kg, and the tolerance threshold for soil salinity was 2500 ppm. These three factors, elevation, soil total nitrogen, and soil salinity, collectively influenced habitat quality, with weights of 0.68, 0.23, and 0.09, respectively, as determined through geodetector analysis. During the summer, we observed a dominance of dispersal in S. mariqueter, with the species primarily spreading to areas with increased habitat quality. Patch shapes tended to be compact and regular in this season. In contrast, during the autumn, a dominance of decline was observed, with S. mariqueter mainly distributing to areas exhibiting decreased habitat quality. Patch shapes tended to be complex and irregular in the autumn season. Eventually micro-geomorphic modification and patch shape filling methods based on UAV observations are proposed to aid wetland restoration. These findings are of utmost importance for the restoration of coastal wetlands and the enhancement of ecosystem resilience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","{""Deitch, M.

6862966,"Semisupervised Change Detection With Feature-Prediction Alignment","Change detection (CD) has received raising attention for its broad application value. However, traditional fully supervised CD methods have a huge demand for pixel-level annotations, which are laborious and even impossible in some few-shot scenarios. Recently, several semisupervised CD (SSCD) methods have been proposed to utilize numerous unlabeled remote sensing image (RSI) pairs, which can largely reduce the annotation dependence. These methods are mainly based on: 1) adversarial learning, whose optimization direction is difficult to control as a black-box method, or 2) feature-consistency learning, which has no explicit physical meaning. To deal with these difficulties, we propose a novel progressive SSCD framework in this article, termed feature-prediction alignment (FPA). FPA can efficiently utilize unlabeled RSI pairs for training by two alignment strategies. First, a class-aware feature alignment (FA) strategy is designed to align the area-level change/no-change feature extracted from different unlabeled RSI pairs (i.e., across regions) with the awareness of their locations, in order to reduce the feature difference within the same classes. Second, a pixelwise prediction alignment (PA) is devised to align the pixel-level change prediction of strongly augmented unlabeled RSI pairs to the pseudo-labels calculated from the corresponding weakly augmented counterparts, in order to reduce the prediction uncertainty of various RSI transformations with physical meaning. Experiments are carried out on four widely used CD benchmarks, including Learning, Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory (LEVIR-CD), Wuhan University building CD (WHU-CD), CDD, and GZ-CD, and our FPA achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and generalization.

6862784,"Spatial-Spectral Clustering With Anchor Graph For Hyperspectral Image","Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering, which aims at dividing hyperspectral pixels into clusters without labeled training data, has drawn significant attention in practical applications. Recently, many graph-based clustering methods, which construct an adjacent graph to model the data relationship, have shown dominant performance. However, the high dimensionality of HSI data makes it hard to construct the pairwise adjacent graph. Besides, abundant spatial structures are often overlooked during the clustering procedure. To better handle the high dimensionality problem and preserve the spatial structures, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach called spatial-spectral clustering with anchor graph (SSCAG) for HSI data clustering. The SSCAG has the following contributions: 1) the multiscale filtering module is utilized to smooth the homogeneous regions, so that it can increase the similarity and consistency of neighboring pixels and capture the multiple views of a local region with different scales; 2) a new similarity metric is proposed to embed the spatial-spectral features into the combined adjacent graph, which can mine the intrinsic property structure of HSI data; and 3) the anchor graph (AG)-based strategy is adopted to construct the adjacent graph by a neighbor assignment scheme without hyperparameters, and its optimization employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to replace eigenvalue decomposition to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive experiments on three public HSI datasets show that the proposed SSCAG is competitive against the state-of-the-art approaches. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","{""Chen, M."",""Miao, Y."",""Wang, Q."",""Yuan, Y.""}","10.1109/tgrs.2022.3217597",2024-10-03 17:32:04,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",2022,"{}","{""Anchor graph"",""Anchor graph (AG)"",""Cluster analysis"",""Clustering algorithms"",Eigenvalues,""Graphic methods"",""High dimensionality"",HyperSpectral,""Hyperspectral image"",""Hyperspectral image datas"",Pixels,""Spatial structure"",""Spectral clustering"",""Spectral information"",Spectroscopy,""data set"",eigenfunctions,""graph-based clustering"",""hyperspectral image (HSI)"",""image processing"",""remote sensing"",""satellite imagery"",""spatial-spectral information""}"
6863473,"Changing Mountain Farmscapes: Vulnerability And Migration Drivers In The Paute River Watershed, Southern Ecuador","Abrupt changes in land use/land cover have often characterized Andean rural landscapes. This is particularly notorious in the Paute River watershed in southern Ecuador. We seek to show how, under tenets of the global economy, rural mountain landscapes suffer constant modifications due to the agricultural practices of dwellers and migrants. Erosion of arable slopes takes center stage in analyzing vulnerability due to the high erodibility factor found in this watershed. By using remote sensing and GIS applications, we analyzed the potential erodibility with intersections of rural development constraining of ecosystem services, including the production of water, food, and cultural values in the Paute River watershed. We found six sources of migratory flows and analyzed topographic and elevation effects in potential erodibility indexes of agroecological options to ameliorate the environmental stress. We identified factors associated with migration trends observed in the area and assessed vulnerability issues of resource management that could prevent deforestation, soil erosion, and acculturation amidst the pressures of development in the region. We conclude that sustainable development options can be implemented with a watershed management approach oriented to diminish emigration. This approach shall be integrative, inclusive, and respectful of the rich biocultural diversity heritage conservation of southern Ecuador.","{""Donoso, Mario E."",""Sarmiento, Fausto O.""}","10.1007/s11629-020-6127-y",2024-07-17 16:56:57,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""Farmscapes; Erodibility; Migration; Rurality; Paute; Ecuador""}"
6862741,"Model-Assisted Regional Forest Biomass Estimation Using Lidar And Insar As Auxiliary Data: A Case Study From A Boreal Forest Area","There is a need for accurate inventory methods that produce relevant and timely information on the forest resources and carbon stocks for forest management planning and for implementation of national strategies under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD). Such methods should produce information that is consistent across various geographical scales. Airborne scanning Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is among the most promising remote sensing technologies for estimation of forest resource information such as timber volume and biomass, while acquisition of three dimensional data with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from space is seen as a relevant option for inventory in the tropics because of its ability to ""see through the clouds"" and its potential for frequent updates at low costs. Based on a stratified probability sample of 201 field survey plots collected in a 960 km(2) boreal forest area in Norway, we demonstrate how total above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated at three distinct geographical levels in such a way that the estimates at a smaller level always sum up to the estimate at a larger level. The three levels are (1) a district (the entire study area), (2) a village, local community or estate level, and (3) a stand or patch level. The LiDAR and InSAR data were treated as auxiliary information in the estimation. At the two largest geographical levels model-assisted estimators were employed. A model-based estimation was conducted at the smallest level. Estimates of AGB and corresponding error estimates based on (1) the field sample survey were compared with estimates obtained by using (2) LiDAR and (3) InSAR data as auxiliary information. For the entire study area, the estimates of AGB were 116.0, 101.2, and 111.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Corresponding standard error estimates were 3.7, 1.6, and 3.2 Mg ha(-1). At the smallest geographical level (stand) an independent validation on 35 large field plots was carried out. RMSE values of 17.1-17.3 Mg ha(-1) and 42.6-53.2 Mg ha(-1) were found for LiDAR and InSAR, respectively. A time lag of six years between acquisition of InSAR data and field inventory has introduced some errors. Significant differences between estimates and reference values were found, illustrating the risk of using pure model-based methods in the estimation when there is a lack of fit in the models. We conclude that the examined remote sensing techniques can provide biomass estimates with smaller estimated errors than a field-based sample survey. The improvement can be highly significant, especially for LiDAR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

6863491,"Spatial Features Of Urban Vitality And The Impact Of Built Environment On Them Based On Multi-Source Data: A Case Study Of Shenzhen","As a key index to evaluate whether a city is attractive or has a healthy, comprehensive, and sustainable development potential, urban vitality is critical to the future development and construction of a city. Exploring the mechanism of how the built environment influences urban vitality from the perspective of urban morphology can be conducive to future urban space planning and design and can provide city planners with quantitative and scientific decision-making support. This study uses urban POI, cellular signaling, and nighttime light remote sensing data from Shenzhen to measure its cultural, social, and economic vitality, which constitutes a comprehensive vitality assessment of the city. Spatial features of these urban vitalities were then analyzed to further illustrate their distribution patterns. Using Bivariate Moran's I method, the spatial autocorrelations between economic, social, and cultural vitality were calculated. From the five dimensions of Density, Design, Diversity, Distance to Transit, and Destination Accessibility, the 5D detection index system was constructed to measure the urban built environment. This study also used GeoDetector to detect and analyze the spatial differentiation between various built environmental factors and comprehensive, economic, social, and cultural vitality and to explore the mechanism of the influence of the built environment on urban vitality. The results show that: 1) The spatial distribution of comprehensive vitality is extremely uneven in Shenzhen, with a higher vitality in the southern and western regions of Shenzhen city and a lower vitality in the northern and eastern regions. Areas with higher comprehensive vitality usually developed along the main roads and metro lines and are distributed in strips along the coastline of central-southern and western Shenzhen. The high-value areas of the urban comprehensive vitality center are primarily concentrated in city- or district-level commercial centers, and employment centers. Comprehensive vitality in Shenzhen reflects social vitality. 2) Urban comprehensive, economic, social, and cultural vitality are significantly affected by the built environment, as indicated by the 5D system. High POI and building density, average building floors, and land use entropy, have significant positive impacts on urban vitality. However, residential population density did not have a significant impact on each aspect of urban vitality. 3) Some interactions between built environment factors had a greater impact on urban comprehensive vitality, such as residential population density, road network density, land use entropy, and road network density. Overall, the interaction between building density, average building floors, land use entropy, and other factors, have a more positive impact on each aspect of urban vitality. 4) The presentation of urban comprehensive vitality is the result of multiple dimensions and factors. In the influencing mechanism of urban comprehensive vitality, building density and average building floors were the fundamental factors. POI density and land use entropy were the direct driving factors. Residential population density was an inducing factor. Distance from the administrative center, intersection density, road network density, metro station density, and bus station density were adjustive factors.

6447818,"Effects of human demand on conservation planning for biodiversity and ecosystem services","Safeguarding ecosystem services and biodiversity is critical to achieving sustainable development. To date, ecosystem services quantification has focused on the biophysical supply of services with less emphasis on human beneficiaries (i.e., demand). Only when both occur do ecosystems benefit people, but demand may shift ecosystem service priorities toward human-dominated landscapes that support less biodiversity. We quantified how accounting for demand affects the efficiency of conservation in capturing both human benefits and biodiversity by comparing conservation priorities identified with and without accounting for demand. We mapped supply and benefit for 3 ecosystem services (flood mitigation, crop pollination, and nature-based recreation) by adapting existing ecosystem service models to include and exclude factors representing human demand. We then identified conservation priorities for each with the conservation planning program Marxan. Particularly for flood mitigation and crop pollination, supply served as a poor proxy for benefit because demand changed the spatial distribution of ecosystem service provision. Including demand when jointly targeting biodiversity and ecosystem service increased the efficiency of conservation efforts targeting ecosystem services without reducing biodiversity outcomes. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating demand when quantifying ecosystem services for conservation planning.","{""Galford, Gillian L."",""Koh, Insu"",""Ricketts, Taylor H."",""Sonter, Laura J."",""Watson, Keri B.""}","10.1111/cobi.13276",NA,NA,NA,2019,"{cco}","{beneficiaries,beneficiarios,biodiversidad,biodiversity,""conservation planning"",demand,demanda,""ecosystem services"",""planeación de la conservación"",""servicios ambientales"",保护规划,受益者,生态系统服务,生物多样性,需求}"
6863610,"Nitrogen Measurement For Variable-Rate N Management In Maize","Numerous proximal and remote soil and plant-testing methods are available to guide variable-rate N management in maize production. These include preseason and late spring soil nitrate tests, late season stalk nitrate tests, handheld chlorophyll meter readings, remote sensing of soil and crop canopy properties, site-specific data from yield monitors and soil electrical conductivity maps. Field applicators have even been equipped to sense the N status of a crop and direct the application of any needed N on-the-go. However, the adoption rates of variable-rate N management are low worldwide despite the potential economic and environmental benefits of this practice and the availability of variable-rate application technology in key areas of maize production. A major obstacle is the finding that recommended N fertilizer rates based on yield goal are often poorly correlated with actual economically optimum N rates. Nitrogen response patterns are often field and season specific and can vary widely within the same field, further complicating adoption. Paired field comparisons of uniform- and variable-rate N management have revealed no consistent advantages for either strategy in yields achieved, whole-field N usage or N use efficiency by plants. Research with other agronomic crops also indicates that the scale for determining crop N need may be as low as 1 m(2). An additional constraint is that growers implementing variable-rate N techniques often are required to install several adequately fertilized N reference strips in their fields that have proven to be both hybrid and season specific. In addition to these agronomic and logistical challenges, the maximum potential benefit of a variable N strategy vs. a conventional uniform-rate N strategy is typically between 12 and 37 USD(\$)/ha. When the cost of developing and executing the variable-rate strategy is considered, the practice shows a low economic return. In the future, innovations in N soil testing, better crop simulation models, and improved N sensing and application equipment may assist growers in capturing the benefits of site-specific N management in maize production.","{""Doerge, TA""}","10.1081/css-200042960",2024-07-17 21:41:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2005,"{}",NA
6862893,"Testing Early Warning Metrics For Drought-Induced Tree Physiological Stress And Mortality","Climate change-driven drought stress has triggered numerous large-scale tree mortality events in recent decades. Advances in mechanistic understanding and prediction are greatly limited by an inability to detect in situ where trees are likely to die in order to take timely measurements and actions. Thus, algorithms of early warning and detection of drought-induced tree stress and mortality could have major scientific and societal benefits. Here, we leverage two consecutive droughts in the southwestern United States to develop and test a set of early warning metrics. Using Landsat satellite data, we constructed early warning metrics from the first drought event. We then tested these metrics' ability to predict spatial patterns in tree physiological stress and mortality from the second drought. To test the broader applicability of these metrics, we also examined a separate drought in the Amazon rainforest. The early warning metrics successfully explained subsequent tree mortality in the second drought in the southwestern US, as well as mortality in the independent drought in tropical forests. The metrics also strongly correlated with spatial patterns in tree hydraulic stress underlying mortality, which provides a strong link between tree physiological stress and remote sensing during the severe drought and indicates that the loss of hydraulic function during drought likely mediated subsequent mortality. Thus, early warning metrics provide a critical foundation for elucidating the physiological mechanisms underpinning tree mortality in mature forests and guiding management responses to these climate-induced disturbances.","{""Anderegg, Leander D.

6863114,"Fire, People And Pixels: Linking Social Science And Remote Sensing To Understand Underlying Causes And Impacts Of Fires In Indonesia","This study in the wake of 1990s fire catastrophes identifies and analyzes underlying causes of vegetation fires in eight locations across Borneo and Sumatra. Multidisciplinary and multiscale analysis integrates geospatial technologies with varied social research approaches and participatory mapping. It helps fill a void of site-specific evidence on diverse underlying causes of the Indonesian fires, despite emerging consensus on macrolevel causes and impacts, and policy debates on preventing future fire disasters. Our most important findings include confirmation of multiple direct and underlying fire causes at each of the eight locations, no single dominant fire cause at any site, and wide differences in fire causes among sites. Conclusions emphasize the importance of location specific studies within a regional analytical context. Our ""hybrid"" research methods demonstrate the explanatory power of integrating geospatial and social analysis techniques, and the benefits of analyzing fire causes and impacts at multiple scales in varied locations across diverse regions.","{""Applegate, G"",""Chokkalingam, U"",""Colfer, CJP"",""Dennis, RA"",""Kurniawan, I"",""Lachowski, H"",""Maus, P"",""Mayer, J"",""Permana, RP"",""Ruchiat, Y"",""Stolle, F"",Suyanto,""Tomich, TP""}","10.1007/s10745-005-5156-z",2024-07-19 18:54:09,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2005,"{}","{""fires; underlying causes; remote sensing; GIS; participatory mapping; Indonesia""}"
6863202,"Current Situation And Existing Problems Of Agricultural Informatization In China","This paper analyzes the development trends of frontier technology for agricultural informatization including five aspects of agricultural sensor technology, precision farming technology, agricultural robot technology, agricultural internet of things technology, and agricultural information service technology. It also discusses the existing problems in the development of frontier technology for agricultural informatization in China and proposes corresponding countermeasures. Firstly, the paper introduces the frontier techniques for agricultural informatization. For advanced agricultural sensor technology, three types of techniques are described, namely life information sensing technique, environmental information sensing technique, and comprehensive information collecting technique. For precision farming technology and intelligent equipment, onboard farmland information collection technique, precision farming positioning and controlling technique, decision model and prescription generating technique, and precise implementation technique are described. For agricultural intelligent robot technology, terrestrial mobile platform navigation and control technique and action planning technique are introduced. For agricultural internet of things technology and equipment, several issues are discussed including the sophisticated monitoring and scheduling of resources, ecological environment monitoring and management, agricultural product quality safety traceability, etc. For agricultural information service technology, frontier techniques and applications for agricultural remote sensing and agricultural information resource value-added services are evaluated. Major problems existed in the development of agricultural informatization technology in China are also discussed. For agricultural sensor technology, the existing problems include that the agricultural information dynamic sensing technique needs to be improved, advanced agricultural sensor technique and industry development are not perfect, and agricultural sensor after-sales supports arenot sufficient. For precision farming technology and intelligent equipment, China has not had its 3S technical support system that is suitable for agricultural applications and its intelligent equipment research and development is not sufficient. For agricultural robot technology, the research direction selection is very subjective, and the research content mainly focuses on the planting industry. Leading robot research agencies rarely involve the agriculture domain. For the industrialization of agricultural robot, related domestic patents are not sufficient and foreign companies take a large market share. For agricultural internet of things technology and equipment, there are also some problems in the technology standard, security, industrialization, application and promotion. For agricultural information services, agricultural remote sensor practicality needs to be improved, software development capability is not sufficient, and the service targets are not well trained. Finally, suggestions are proposed as countermeasures to the existing problems. Agricultural information technology innovation needs to be accelerated. Major engineering projects need to be established to support the informatization development. Subsidies for agricultural informatization need to be implemented. Agricultural informatization standards and evaluation system need to be improved. Researches show that agricultural sensor technology is the basis of agricultural information acquisition and informatization. Precision farming technology represents today's advanced level of agricultural equipment. Agricultural robot technology is an important research direction for agricultural intelligent equipment in the future. Agricultural internet of things technology is an effective means of agricultural supervision and quality monitoring. Agricultural information service technology is more and more focusing on the key technical problems of cloud storage, cloud computing, cloud service and mobile internet in agricultural info mation services.","{""Chen, W."",""Guo, S.""}","10.3969/j.issn.1002-6819.2013.22.023",2024-07-19 19:22:01,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2013,"{}","{""Advanced technology"",""Agricultural information service"",""Agricultural informations"",""Agricultural products"",Agriculture,Competition,""Environmental technology"",Industry,""Information management"",""Information services"",""Information technology"",Informatization,Internet,""Internet of Things (IOT)"",""Internet of things"",""Precision farming"",""Remote sensing"",Research,Robots,Scheduling,Sensors}"
6863401,"Habitat Conservation, Ethanol, And Recent Us Federal Farm Bills: A Gis Study Exploring Conservation Reserve Program Trends Pre-And Post-Ethanol Expansion In The Upper Midwest","Farmland in the Upper Midwest, USA, planted to corn has increased significantly in the past decade due to a rush toward ethanol production for fuel. Much of this increase came from fields that were previously protected under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a Federal land retirement incentive. This Geographic Information Systems (GIS) study quantifies these land changes in Minnesota, a northern state in the U.S. Corn Belt, prior to the past decade using 1997 and 2008 CRP GIS data layers for individual fields. Currently available CRP enrollment data by county masks significant changes occurring on a field-level scale, data which is no longer publicly available. Results suggest that marginal lands better suited for riparian wildlife habitat and surface water protection were plowed under in favor of industrial corn production. This was especially notable with fields in close proximity to refineries or those in drinking water supply management or groundwater contamination susceptibility areas. Federal ethanol mandates, farm bill policies, and high corn prices contribute to the pressure to farm these sensitive lands. Currently, CRP enrollments are capped at 9.7 million hectares, reduced from a long-standing 13-million-hectare cap by the 2014 farm bill. Discussions are now underway in the U.S. Congress to craft the 2018 farm bill and farming and conservation interests are strongly urging the Federal government to restore the 13-million-hectare enrollment cap. Ecosystem functions and benefits are optimized when conservation efforts are maintained over long periods and not interrupted by short-Term political or economic trends. © 2019 All rights reserved.","{""Kelley, D.""}","10.3375/043.039.0302",2024-07-17 19:44:44,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2019,"{}","{""Conservation Reserve Program"",""Farm Bill"",biofuels,ethanol}"
6903480,"Efficient Storage Method For Massive Remote Sensing Image Via Spark-Based Pyramid Model","The amount of remote sensing (RS) image has grown considerably and the Big Data era of images has truly emerged. Traditional storage and processing methods cannot meet the requirements of the growing massive image data. So how to provide effective storage and high-performance computation service has brought a great challenge to the research community. In this paper, we present the efficient storage of massive remote sensing image via Spark-based Pyramid model. Based on selection of rational number of image layer via the maximum division layer algorithm, we design the Spark-oriented distributed construction method. We use RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) on Spark system to represent data structures for metadata and ranks, and there is no need to materialize these data structures across multiple iterations. Using our construction method and RDDs caching technology, we design the efficient storage structure of RS image data, which can achieve high-performance processing of massive RS image on Spark system. Experimental results show that proper values can be obtained via optimization parameters of image tile. Also throughput rate and construction performance are much higher than MapReduce and Hadoop.",NA,"10.24507/ijicic.13.06.1915",2024-09-27 22:25:07,"excluded","{""No societal value context""}",NA,"{""storage efficiency""}",NA
6903507,"Opti-Msfa: A Toolbox For Generalized Design And Optimization Of Multispectral Filter Arrays","Multispectral imaging captures spatial information across a set of discrete spectral channels and is widely utilized across diverse applications such as remote sensing, industrial inspection, and biomedical imaging. Multispectral filter arrays (MSFAs) are filter mosaics integrated atop image sensors that facilitate cost-effective, compact, snapshot multispectral imaging. MSFAs are pre-configured based on application-where filter channels are selected corresponding to targeted absorption spectra-making the design of optimal MSFAs vital for a given application. Despite the availability of many design and optimization approaches for spectral channel selection and spatial arrangement, major limitations remain. There are few robust approaches for joint spectral-spatial optimization, techniques are typically only applicable to limited datasets and most critically, are not available for general use and improvement by the wider community. Here, we reconcile current MSFA design techniques and present Opti-MSFA: a Python-based open-access toolbox for the centralized design and optimization of MSFAs. Opti-MSFA incorporates established spectral-spatial optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and simulated annealing, multispectral-RGB image reconstruction, and is applicable to user-defined input of spatial-spectral datasets or imagery. We demonstrate the utility of the toolbox by comparing against other published MSFAs using the standard hyperspectral datasets Samson and Jasper Ridge, and further show application on experimentally acquired fluorescence imaging data. In conjunction with end-user input and collaboration, we foresee the continued development of Opti-MSFA for the benefit of the wider research community.

6863233,"Biophysical And Policy Drivers Of Landscape Change In A Central Vietnamese District","Conservation in a dynamic setting requires understanding the factors leading to landscape change. This study integrated traditional remote sensing and geographic information systems analysis techniques with a narrative policy analysis to assess the 19752004 land cover changes and their determinants in Nam Dong district (central Vietnam). Total forest cover of Nam Dong remained stable, but there were major transitions within forest and non-forest categories. Recent policy initiatives, particularly forest land allocation, have resulted in short-term benefit maximization through land speculation and illegal logging, while increased awareness of the economic potential of forests and their products have motivated people to access forests more frequently, leading to a highly dynamic landscape and increased barriers to forest conservation. This study suggests that (1) state-sponsored logging needs to be reduced, (2) forest allocation should proceed more rapidly to give farmers better incentive to improve and protect allocated forests, and (3) small-scale industry should increase. Forest conservation policy must be amended. More research is needed to link household land-use choices with policies, and determine how those choices lead to changes in the landscape.","{""Honda, Kiyoshi"",Thiha,""Webb, Edward L.""}","10.1017/s037689290700389x",2024-07-16 22:56:19,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2007,"{}","{""conservation; deforestation; forest land allocation; land use; Nam Dong; policy analysis""}"

6863577,"Monitoring Of Wetland Inundation Dynamics In The Delmarva Peninsula Using Landsat Time-Series Imagery From 1985 To 2011","Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, the provision of which is largely controlled by fluctuations in inundation and soil saturation. Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was ~ 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r2 values of 32–36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r2 values of 25–34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","{""Huang, C."",""Jin, H."",""Lang, M.

6863448,"Estimating Aboveground Biomass Using Sentinel-2 Msi Data And Ensemble Algorithms For Grassland In The Shengjin Lake Wetland, China","Wetland vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) directly indicates wetland ecosystem health and is critical for water purification, carbon cycle, and biodiversity conservation. Accurate AGB estimation is essential for the monitoring and supervision of ecosystems, especially in seasonal floodplain wetlands. This paper explored the capability of spectral and texture features from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for modeling grassland AGB using random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in Shengjin Lake wetland (a Ramsar site). We use five-fold cross-validation to verify the model effectiveness. The results indicated that the RF and XGBoost models had a robust and efficient performance (with root mean square error (RMSE) of 126.571 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.844 for RF, RMSE of 112.425 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.869 for XGBoost), and the XGBoost models, by contrast, performed better. Both traditional and red-edge vegetation indices (VIs) obtained satisfactory results of AGB estimation (RMSE = 127.936 g center dot m(-2), RMSE = 125.879 g center dot m(-2) in XGBoost models, respectively), with the red-edge VIs contributed more to the AGB models. Moreover, we selected eight gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures calculated by four processing window sizes using the mean value of four offsets, and further analyzed the results of three analysis sets. Textures derived from traditional and red-edge bands using a 7 x 7 window size performed better in biomass estimation. This finding suggested that textures derived from the traditional bands were as important as the red-edge bands. The introduction of textures moderately improved the accuracy of modeling AGB, whereas the use of textures alo ne was not satisfactory. This research demonstrated that using the Sentinel-2 MSI and the two ensemble algorithms is an effective method for long-term dynamic monitoring and assessment of grass AGB in seasonal floodplain wetlands, which can support sustainable management and carbon accounting of wetland ecosystems.","{""Li, Chunhua"",""Xu, Wenbin"",""Zhou, Lizhi""}","10.3390/rs13081595",2024-07-19 20:15:17,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{calibration}","{""aboveground biomass; Sentinel-2 MSI; ensemble algorithm; red-edge; GLCM; Shengjin Lake wetland""}"
6863621,"Annual Change Analysis Of Mangrove Forests In China During 1986-2021 Based On Google Earth Engine","Mangroves are a key type of protected coastal wetland, with a range of benefits such as protection from wave damage, sand fixation, water purification and ecological tourism. As the academic knowledge of mangroves has gradually increased, the use of remote sensing to monitor their dynamic changes in China has become a hot topic of discussion and has received attention in academic circles. Remote sensing has also provided necessary auxiliary decision-making suggestions and data support for the scientific and rational conservation, restoration and management of mangrove resources. In this paper, we used Landsat satellite series data combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and adaptive threshold partitioning (OTSU method) to monitor mangrove dynamics in coastal China from 1986 to 2021 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE), with three main results. (1) Based on the massive data and efficient computational capability of the GEE platform, we achieved large-scale interannual mangrove distribution extraction. The overall classification accuracy for 2019 exceeded 0.93, and the mangrove distribution extraction effect was good. (2) The total mangrove area and the mean patch size in China showed overall increasing trends, and Guangdong and Guangxi were the top two provinces in China in terms of the largest mangrove area. (3) Except for Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve, the mangrove areas in other national mangrove reserves mainly showed increasing trends, confirming the effectiveness of the reserves. Data on the spatial structure and area trends of mangroves in China can provide scientific references for mangrove conservation and development, and serve in the further restoration of mangrove ecosystems.","{""Cao, Jingjing"",""Liu, Kai"",""Peng, Liheng"",""Wang, Ziyu"",""Wen, Xin""}","10.3390/f13091489",2024-07-17 00:07:31,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2022,"{}","{""remote sensing; mangrove; monitoring; Google Earth Engine (GEE); China""}"

The spread of infectious disease has neither political nor economic boundaries, and when elevated to a status of pandemic proportions, immediate action is required. In federal systems of government, the national level leads the policy formation and implementation process, but also collaborates with supranational organisations as part of the global health network. Likewise, the national level of government cooperates with sub-national governments located in both urban and rural areas. Rural areas, particularly in less developed countries, tend to have higher poverty rates and lack the benefits of proper medical facilities, communication modes and technology to prevent the spread of disease. From the perspective of epidemiological surveillance and intervention, this article will examine federal health policies in three federal systems: Australia, Malaysia and the USA. Using the theoretical foundations of collaborative federalism, this article specifically examines how collaborative arrangements and interactions among governmental and non-governmental actors help to address the inherent discrepancies that exist between policy implementation and reactions to outbreaks in urban and rural areas.

6903654,"Collective Forest Tenure Reform And Forest Conditions: Evidence From The Social-Ecological System In Southwest China","China's recent collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve forest conditions by devolution of forest management rights from community collectives to individual households. Studies reveal substantial local variation in CFTR implementation, but the ecological effects and underlying mechanism have received little attention. Our study focused on community-managed forests and household-managed forests in four communities located in the mountains of Southwest China. The objective was to investigate the relationship between CFTR and forest conditions at the local scale. We employed a combination of remote sensing technology, field forest observations and socioeconomic surveys to gather data for analysis. The results showed that the forest cover change trends of collective forests and household forests in each community were consistent from 1994 to 2014. There was no significant relationship between CFTR implementation and local-level differences in species diversity and soil fertility in forests. The aboveground biomass of collective forests was significantly higher than that of household forests. Differentiated access and use, low compensation amounts, and loose payment terms jointly affected CFTR's effectiveness to improve local-scale forest conditions in the study area. Attempts to formalize forest tenure rights must be flexible enough and adapted to the local environment so that changes induced by the CFTR can improve local access to forest resources and its benefits.",NA,"10.3389/ffgc.2023.1162058",2024-10-01 17:53:02,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA

Reclamation of the mangroves in this region ceased in the 1930s. However, they are still subject to adverse environmental influences, such as sediment starvation due to migration of the main river channels in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta over the last few centuries, cyclone landfall, wave action from the Bay of Bengal-changing hydrology due to upstream water diversion-and the pervasive effects of relative sea-level rise. This study builds on earlier work to assess changes from 2000 to 2020 in mangrove extent, genus composition, and mangrove 'health' indicators, using various vegetation indices derived from Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery by performing maximum likelihood supervised classification. We show that about 110 km(2) of mangroves disappeared within the reserve forest due to erosion, and 81 km(2) were gained within the inhabited part of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) through plantation and regeneration. The gains are all outside the contiguous mangroves. However, they partially compensate for the losses of the contiguous mangroves in terms of carbon. Genus composition, analyzed by amalgamating data from published literature and ground-truthing surveys, shows change towards more salt-tolerant genus accompanied by a reduction in the prevalence of freshwater-loving Heiritiera, Nypa, and Sonneratia assemblages. Health indicators, such as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), show a monotonic trend of deterioration over the last two decades, which is more pronounced in the sea-facing parts of the mangrove forests. An increase in salinity, a temperature rise, and rainfall reduction in the pre-monsoon and the post-monsoon periods appear to have led to such degradation. Collectively, these results show a decline in mangrove area and health, which poses an existential threat to the Indian Sundarbans in the long term, especially under scenarios of climate change and sea-level rise. Given its unique values, the policy process should acknowledge and address these threats.","{""Chanda, Abhra"",""French, Jon R."",""Giri, Sandip"",""Hazra, Sugata"",""Mondal, Partho P."",""Nicholls, Robert J."",""Samanta, Sourav""}","10.3390/rs13244957",2024-07-18 22:38:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2021,"{}","{""salinity; tropical cyclones; relative sea-level rise; erosion; mangrove health; remote sensing""}"
6863260,"Development And Validation Of The Medication Regimen Simplification Guide For Residential Aged Care (Mrs Grace)","Background: Residents of aged care facilities use increasingly complex medication regimens. Reducing unnecessary medication regimen complexity (eg, by consolidating the number of administration times or using alternative formulations) may benefit residents and staff. Objective: To develop and validate an implicit tool to facilitate medication regimen simplification in aged care facilities. Method: A purposively selected multidisciplinary expert panel used modified nominal group technique to identify and prioritize factors important in determining whether a medication regimen can be simplified. The five prioritized factors were formulated as questions, pilottested using non-identifiable medication charts and refined by panel members. The final tool was validated by two clinical pharmacists who independently applied the tool to a random sample of 50 residents of aged care facilities to identify opportunities for medication regimen simplification. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen’s kappa. Results: The Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE) was developed as an implicit tool comprising of five questions about 1) the resident; 2) regulatory and safety requirements; 3) drug interactions; 4) formulation; and 5) facility and follow-up considerations. Using MRS GRACE, two pharmacists independently simplified medication regimens for 29/50 and 30/50 residents (Cohen’s kappa=0.38, 95% CI 0.12–0.64), respectively. Simplification was possible for all residents with five or more administration times. Changing an administration time comprised 75% of the two pharmacists’ recommendations. Conclusions: Using MRS GRACE, two clinical pharmacists independently simplified over half of residents’ medication regimens with fair agreement. MRS GRACE is a promising new tool to guide medication regimen simplification in aged care. © 2018 Chen et al.","{""Alderman, C. P."",""Bell, J. S."",""Chen, E. Y.

6903518,"A Blind Convolutional Deep Autoencoder For Spectral Unmixing Of Hyperspectral Images Over Waterbodies","Harmful algal blooms have dangerous repercussions for biodiversity, the ecosystem, and public health. Automatic identification based on remote sensing hyperspectral image analysis provides a valuable mechanism for extracting the spectral signatures of harmful algal blooms and their respective percentage in a region of interest. This paper proposes a new model called a non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing to perform endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation. The model is assessed in benchmark datasets, such as Jasper Ridge and Samson. Additionally, a case study of the HSI2 image acquired by NASA over Lake Erie in 2017 is conducted for extracting optical water types. The results using the proposed model for the benchmark datasets improve unmixing performance, as indicated by the spectral angle distance compared to five baseline algorithms. Improved results were obtained for various metrics. In the Samson dataset, the proposed model outperformed other methods for water (0.060) and soil (0.025) endmember extraction. Moreover, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in terms of mean spectral angle distance compared to the other five baseline algorithms. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing approach achieved better results for abundance map estimation, with a root mean square error of 0.091 for water and 0.187 for soil, compared to the ground truth. For the Jasper Ridge dataset, the non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing model excelled in the tree (0.039) and road (0.068) endmember extraction and also demonstrated improved results for water abundance maps (0.1121). The proposed model can identify the presence of chlorophyll-a in waterbodies. Chlorophyll-a is an essential indicator of the presence of the different concentrations of macrophytes and cyanobacteria. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing achieves a value of 0.307 for the spectral angle distance metric compared to a reference ground truth spectral signature of chlorophyll-a.

6863070,"The Role Of Habitat Features In Patterns Of Population Connectivity Of Two Mediterranean Amphibians In Arid Landscapes Of Central Iberia","Context Mediterranean wetland ecosystems are in continuous decline due to human pressure. Amphibians are key elements of biotic communities of Mediterranean temporary ponds and streams, and their persistence depends on the availability and inter-connectivity of breeding sites. Objectives We investigated the role of different factors potentially driving functional connectivity patterns in two amphibian species at the landscape and local scales. We focused on two Mediterranean endemic pond-breeding amphibians inhabiting semi-arid landscapes of central Spain, the common parsley frog (Pelodytes punctatus) and the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans). Methods We genotyped 336 individuals of P. punctatus and 318 of A. obstetricans from 17 and 16 breeding populations at 10 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. We used remotely sensed vegetation/moisture indices and land use/cover data to derive optimized resistance surfaces and test their association with estimates of gene flow and migration rates across populations. Results We found evidence for higher population connectivity in common midwife toads than in common parsley frogs, with a strong effect of water availability in patterns of population connectivity of both species. However, the two species differ in the role of landscape features on population connectivity, with the distance and spatial distribution of artificial land-use types positively influencing connectivity in A. obstetricans and meadows/pastureland favouring P. punctatus. This is in line with reported breeding site preferences for the two species, with A. obstetricans successfully breeding in artificial water bodies that P. punctatus generally avoid. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of assessing species-habitat relationships shaping connectivity when developing and implementing conservation and management actions to benefit fragmented amphibian populations in the Mediterranean region. Our results show that amphibian species respond differently, even contrastingly to landscape features and thus require alternative, complementary strategies to improve population connectivity and ensure long-term viability.","{""Caballero-Diaz, Carlos"",""Civantos, Emilio"",""Goncalves, Helena"",""Goncalves, Joao"",""Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Jorge"",""Maia-Carvalho, Bruno"",""Martinez-Solano, Inigo""}","10.1007/s10980-022-01548-z",2024-09-27 23:36:07,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2023,"{""spurious terra""}","{""Conservation; Remote sensing; Landscape resistance; Gene flow; Wetlands; Population genetics""}"
6863222,"Vocational Education And Training: The Terra Incognita Of Innovation Policy","Is what is known from research on systemic innovation reflected in innovation policy, both as guiding principles and as actions? This paper highlights a major paradox in the translation of research on innovation into innovation policy in Australia. The innovation studies literature has established the central role of the vocational education and training (VET) system and VET-trained workers in technology generation, diffusion and incremental innovation. Research has also established that the pattern of innovation in Australia, compared with that in many other OECD countries, makes firms more reliant on VET skills to implement innovation. Despite this recognition in the innovation literature, this paper argues that the VET system is largely excluded from government innovation policy and programmes in Australia. Evidence for this exclusion is derived from a textual analysis of the principal Australian government policy statements and government-sponsored studies of the Australian innovation system, and from an analysis of the interest groups represented on government innovation advisory and policy structures. Tentative explanations are advanced for this exclusion and a number of important benefits are identified for the VET system and the wider innovation system arising from closer integration of VET into innovation policy","{""Dalitz, Robert"",""Toner, Phillip""}","10.1080/08109028.2012.746412",2024-07-19 21:06:30,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2012,"{""spurious match: terra""}",NA
6903500,"Long-Term Spatiotemporal Variability In High Andean Wetlands In Northern Chile","High Andean wetlands of the elevated plateaus of the Andes Mountains of Chile, Argentina, Perú and Bolivia are true oases that sustain life in this arid region. Despite their ecological value, they have been rarely studied and are vulnerable to climate change and human activities that require groundwater resources. One such activity that may be intensified in the near future is mining for nonmetallic minerals such as lithium, whose worldwide demand is expected to increase with the rise of electric vehicles that need batteries. To determine a baseline of the natural dynamics of these systems, which allows sustainable management, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wetlands. In this article, we studied the temporal and spatial dynamics of high Andean wetlands of Chile, with the aim of identifying the key processes that govern their dynamics. To do this, we used time series of Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 to study 10 high Andean wetlands. Furthermore, to characterize the climate variability in these systems, we studied the long-term relation between the changes in water and vegetation areas with rainfall and evaporation variability. It was found that the groundwater reservoir plays a key role in sustaining the high Andean wetlands. Wet years with a period of occurrence of 20–30 years are the years in which the groundwater reservoirs are actually recharged, and in between wet years, the groundwater reservoirs gradually release the water that sustains the aquatic ecosystems. Hence, groundwater exploitation should be carefully designed from a long-term perspective, as groundwater levels could take decades to recover. © 2020 The Authors",NA,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143830",2024-10-03 22:27:53,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",NA,"{}",NA
6863545,"Implication Of Drainage Basin Parameters Of Chhoti Gandak River, Ganga Plain, India","The drainage basin parameters of the groundwater-fed Chhoti Gandak River originating in the terai area of the Ganga Plain were analyzed using topographical sheets, satellite data, and field documentation with emphasis to its implication for flood mitigation and recharging of groundwater. The analyses indicate dominance of first order streams, gentle slope gradient, low surface run-off, low sediment production, high infiltration rate, and low value of basin relief. The low water storage capacity, spreading of water and concentration of peak discharge in the distal part of the river basin explain that whenever precipitation is high in the catchment area there is flood in the distal part of the basin. The bifurcation ratio value (4.34) of this basin describes that the drainage is carved naturally by slope and local relief and not influenced by geological structures like lineaments and faults. These parameters provide useful information for the prediction of basin behavior during prolonged heavy rainfall that generate floods and suggest that water resource management and developmental planning should be done with reference to the drainage basin parameters.","{""Awasthi, Amit"",""Sen Singh, Dhruv""}","10.1007/s12594-011-0102-8",2024-09-30 02:17:43,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2011,"{}","{""Morphometric analysis; Flooding; Chhoti Gandak; Ganga Plain""}"
6862822,"Investigation Of Satellite Precipitation Product Driven Rainfall-Runoff Model Using Deep Learning Approaches In Two Different Catchments Of India","Rainfall-runoff models are valuable tools for flood forecasting, management of water resources, and drought warning. With the advancement in space technology, a plethora of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) are available publicly. However, the application of the satellite data for the data-driven rainfall-runoff model is emerging and requires careful investigation. In this work, two satellite rainfall data sets, namely Global Precipitation Measurement-Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval Product V6 (GPM-IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), are evaluated for the development of rainfall-runoff models and the prediction of 1-day ahead streamflow. The accuracy of the data from the SPPs is compared to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)-gridded precipitation data set. Detection metrics showed that for light rainfall (1-10 mm), the probability of detection (POD) value ranges between 0.67 and 0.75 and with an increasing rainfall range, i.e., medium and heavy rainfall (10-50 mm and.50 mm), the POD values ranged from 0.24 to 0.45. These results indicate that the satellite precipitation performs satisfactorily with reference to the IMD-gridded data set. Using the daily precipitation data of nearly two decades (2000-2018) over two river basins in India's eastern part, artificial neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), and long short-time memory (LSTM) models are developed for rainfall-runoff modelling. One-day ahead runoff prediction using the developed rainfall-runoff modelling confirmed that both the SPPs are sufficient to drive the rainfall-runoff models with a reasonable accuracy estimated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, correlation coefficient, and the root-mean-squared error. In particular, the 1-day streamflow forecasts for the Vamsadhara river basin (VRB) using LSTM with GPM-IMERG inputs resulted in Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSC) values of 0.68 and 0.67, while ELM models for Mahanadhi river basin (MRB) with the same input resulted in NSC values of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, during training and validation stages. At the same time, the LSTM model with CHIRPS inputs for the VRB resulted in NSC values of 0.68 and 0.65, and the ELM model with CHIRPS inputs for the MRB resulted in NSC values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively, in training and validation stages. These results indicated that both the SPPs could reliably be used with LSTM and ELM models for rainfall-runoff modelling and streamflow prediction. This paper highlights that deep learning models, such as ELM and LSTM, with the GPM-IMERG products can lead to a new horizon to provide flood forecasting in flood-prone catchments. © 2022 The Authors","{""Agarwal, A."",""Bhattacharya, B."",""Neelamsetty, S.

6691684,"A New Process for Organizing Assessments of Social, Economic, and Environmental Outcomes: Case Study of Wildland Fire Management in the USA","Ecological risk assessments typically are organized using the processes of planning (a discussion among managers, stakeholders, and analysts to clarify ecosystem management goals and assessment scope) and problem formulation (evaluation of existing information to generate hypotheses about adverse ecological effects, select assessment endpoints, and develop an analysis plan). These processes require modification to be applicable for integrated assessments that evaluate ecosystem management alternatives in terms of their ecological, economic, and social consequences. We present 8 questions that define the steps of a new process we term integrated problem formulation (IPF), and we illustrate the use of IPF through a retrospective case study comparing 2 recent phases of development of the Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system, a planning and budgeting system for the management of wildland fire throughout publicly managed lands in the United States. IPF extends traditional planning and problem formulation by including the explicit comparison of management alternatives, the valuation of ecological, economic and social endpoints, and the combination or integration of those endpoints. The phase 1, limited prototype FPA system used a set of assessment endpoints of common form (i.e., probabilities of given flame heights over acres of selected land-resource types), which were specified and assigned relative weights at the local level in relation to a uniform national standard. This approach was chosen to permit system-wide optimization of fire management budget allocations according to a cost-effectiveness criterion. Before full development, however, the agencies abandoned this approach in favor of a phase 2 system that examined locally specified (rather than system-optimized) allocation alternatives and was more permissive as to endpoint form. We demonstrate how the IPF process illuminates the nature, rationale, and consequences of these differences, and argue that its early use for the FPA system may have enabled a smoother development path.","{""Bruins, Randall""}","https://doi.org/10.1897/IEAM_2009-075.1",2024-04-23 22:03:32,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",2009,"{}","{""Integrated problem formulation|Integrated assessment|Wildland fire|Valuation|Decision making""}"
6863366,"A Preliminary Study Of The Strata And Age Of Ancient Agricultural Terraces In The Ganjia Basin, Northeastern Tibetan Plateau","Agricultural terraces are a manifestation of man's ability to transform nature during the past thousands of years, and they have played an important role in the development of human society. The Ganjia Basin in Xiahe County, Gansu Province, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. A large area of banded landscape is distributed on the hills and piedmonts in the Ganjia Basin, which is claimed to be composed of large-scale abandoned ancient terraces. Based on fieldwork, satellite remote sensing data and GIS analysis in the present study, we found that the ancient terraces cover an area of 42.2 km2 and are mainly distributed on slopes between 2936 and 3326 m a.m.s.l. (meters above mean sea level) on both sides of the Yangqu River and its tributaries in the basin. Additionally, we analyzed various environmental proxies, including magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size, the contents of total organic carbon (nitrogen) (TOC, TN), and palynological assemblages, from three representative sections of ancient agricultural terraces (GJAT-1, GJAT-1, and GJAT-3), and compared them with the MS values and clay content of a natural profile with accurate chronological control in the Ganjia Basin. The results indicate that the terraces are reclaimed paleosols dating to the Late Holocene (3000 kyr BP), and that the homogeneous MS values of the top 25-35 cm of the terrace profiles differ from those of the natural soil section, which confirms the existence of a cultivation layer in the terraces. However, the increases in the contents of TOC and TN above the cultivated layer, and the fact that the trend of MS in the terrace profile is broadly in line with the natural profile, indicate that the terraces were only used for a short interval and have been abandoned for a relatively long time. Combined with historical documentary evidence, we infer that the ancient Xiahe agricultural terraces were constructed as a result of the ""Gongjianshou (bowman) militia farming"" policy during the Northern Song China (1074-1125 CE). Climate reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere and northern China demonstrate that the temperature was higher and that the precipitation increased during this interval, providing a favorable environment for agricultural production. Overall, our results provide a typical example of societal adaptation to climate change in the past. © 2022, Science Press.

Four satellite images of the study area, distributed between 1973 and 2014 were analyzed using Arc GIS software to assess the LULC changes of the area. In addition, we carried out an ecosystem services valuation, based on the identified LULC types and on the ecosystem services values database. Six LULC types were identified in the study area (forest, shrub/bush land, grassland, cultivated land, settlement, and bare land). Forest cover decreased 83% between 1973 and 2014. Settlement and cultivated land increased by 471 and 222%, respectively. The overall ecosystem services value reduced by 68%, and this was mainly due to deforestation. The use of LULC analysis combined to ecosystem services valuation improved our understanding of deforestation trends in the study area.

6862778,"Distribution Characteristics And Influencing Factors Of Milk-Tea Consumption Space From The Perspective Of Scene-Symbol And Physical-Information","In the era of digital economy, the influence of new retail consumption space which combines scene consumption and symbol consumption, and physical space and information space, on the development of urban space is constantly expanding. Taking the consumption space of milk-tea in Xi 'an as the research object, space syntax is used to analyze the distribution characteristics of milk-tea consumption space. Threshold regression and multi- scale geographical weighted regression are constructed to analyze the influencing factors of the distribution of milk-tea consumption space. The results show that: (1) Location selection for new retail milk-tea is highly sensitive to market information and can respond to space regulatory decisions. The factors involved in the traditional retail location theory, such as consumer market, spatial proximity, land price, and industrial development, have a significant impact on the spatial distribution of new retail milk-tea consumption. However, there is a game between physical and information entities in new retail milk-tea consumption space, with the role of information growing significantly with the expansion of scale; (2) The spatial distribution of new retail milk-tea consumption reflects the characteristics of organizational behaviors displayed by brand community. The consumption subjectivity of consumer community is enhanced. The new retail milk-tea consumption space of different brands promotes the growth of consumer communities in various ways; (3) Social culture perception has price threshold effect in both physical and information consumption space. Information flow and material flow are mutually exclusive in the action mechanism of low-priced consumption space scene and symbol value, and cultural dissemination depends on the density, propagation rate, and frequency of scene and symbol. In the action mechanism of high-priced consumption space scene and symbol value, information flow and material flow promote each other, and cultural dissemination depends on the influence and propagation distance of scene and symbol; (4) Spatial syntactic model simulates the extension of information in the consumption space. Threshold regression and multi-scale geographical weighted regression reveal the production and reproduction mechanism of new retail consumption space.

6863526,"Remote Sensing Prescription For Rice Nitrogen Fertilizer Recommendation Based On Improved Nfoa Model","Precise fertilization of rice depends on the timely and effective acquisition of fertilizer application recommended by prescription maps in large-scale cropland, which can provide fertilization spatial information reference. In this paper, the prescription map was discussed based on the improved nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm (NFOA), using satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, and supplemented by meteorological data. Based on the principles of NFOA, firstly, remote sensing data and meteorological data were collected from 2019 to 2021 to construct a prediction model for the potential yield of rice based on the in-season estimated yield index (INSEY). Secondly, based on remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) and spectral features of bands, the grain nitrogen content (GNC) prediction model constructed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to improve the values of GNC taken in the NFOA. The nitrogen demand for rice was calculated according to the improved NFOA. Finally, the nitrogen fertilizer application recommended prescription map of rice in large-scale cropland was generated based on UAV multispectral images, and the economic cost-effectiveness of the prescription map was analyzed.

6862725,"Vertical And Horizontal Habitat Use By White Marlin Kajikia Albida (Poey, 1860) In The Western North Atlantic Ocean","Pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on 40 white marlin Kajika albida (synonym: Tetrapturus albidus) off the coasts of Maryland and North Carolina (United States), and the island nation of Aruba in the Caribbean. Useful data were available for analysing vertical and horizontal habitat use from 28 individuals. Time at liberty ranged from 10 to 181 d (mean 115, SD 53.3). Seasonal southerly fall migration routes were documented for fish released off the northeastern United States, while those released off Aruba remained in the Caribbean basin. Horizontal movements ranged from 228 to 8084 km (19-100 km d(-1)) based on light-level geolocation estimates using a sea surface temperature and bathymetry-corrected Kalman filter. Analyses included an evaluation of vertical movements using Delta T, the time spent at temperature relative to the uniform temperature surface layer. Movements included exploration of depths as great as 387 m and ambient temperatures as low as 7.8 degrees C. However, the greatest proportion of time was spent in the upper 20 m of the water column for both day (50.8\%) and night (81.6\%), and time spent in water colder than 7 degrees C below the uniform temperature surface layer was negligible. Overall, this group showed less variability in vertical movement, and less tolerance to colder temperatures compared with similar studies for blue marlin Makaira nigricans and sailfish Istiophorus platypterus. Values for Delta T are presented in tabular format to allow direct input into habitat standardization models used to estimate vertical distribution and population abundance. The large spatial dispersion and disparate tracks illustrated in the present study serve to underscore the complexity of white marlin behaviour and habitat use, and further emphasize the many challenges facing the management and conservation of this overexploited species.","{""Barse, Ann M."",""Hoolihan, John P."",""Luo, Jiangang"",""Orbesen, Eric S."",""Prince, Eric D."",""Snodgrass, Derke""}","10.1093/icesjms/fsv082",2024-10-03 17:31:36,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2015,"{}","{""Delta t; habitat preference; migration routes; pop-up satellite archival tag; Tetrapturus albidus""}"
6862840,"An Application Of Machine-Learning Model For Analyzing The Impact Of Land-Use Change On Surface Water Resources In Gauteng Province, South Africa","The change in land-use diversity is attributed to the anthropogenic factors sustaining life. The surface water bodies and other crucial natural resources in the study area are being depleted at an alarming rate. This study explored the implications of the changing land-use diversity on surface water resources by using a random forest (RF) classifier machine-learning algorithm and remote-sensing models in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Landsat datasets from 1993 to 2022 were used and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using the RF classifier. The results indicate nine land-use diversity classes having increased and decreased tendencies, with high F-score values ranging from 72.3\% to 100\%. In GP, the spatial coverage of BL has shrunk by 100.4 km(2) every year over the past three decades. Similarly, BuA exhibits an annual decreasing rate of 42.4 km(2) due to the effect of dense vegetation coverage within the same land use type. Meanwhile, water bodies, marine quarries, arable lands, grasslands, shrublands, dense forests, and wetlands were expanded annually by 1.3, 2.3, 2.9, 5.6, 11.2, 29.6, and 89.5 km(2), respectively. The surface water content level of the study area has been poor throughout the study years. The MNDWI and NDWI values have a stronger Pearson correlation at a radius of 5 km (r = 0.60, p = 0.000, n = 87,260) than at 10 and 15 km.

6903492,"Ecosystem Service Valuation Of A Natural Reserve Region For Sustainable Management Of Natural Resources","The mangrove ecosystem is extremely important for providing essential ecosystem services, which are crucial for subsistence and human well-being. Using time-series satellite data products and different unit values, the spatially explicit Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) of six eco-regions of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, has been calculated for four reference years, viz. 1973, 1988, 2002 and 2013. The maximum ESV (million US\$ year(1)) is provided by the mangrove forest (2292-44468), followed by water surface (65-4244), cropland (26-3938), and sparse vegetation cover (0-326). The total ESV (million US\$ year(1)) of Sundarbans is estimated to be 16629.5, 20175.7, 19733.4, and 16761.3 for 1973, 1988, 2002, and 2013 respectively. The regulation of gas and climate, raw material production, and cultural ecosystem services are entirely dependent on the mangrove ecosystem, while the waste treatment, cultural, and water regulation services are found to be highly sensitive to the changes in water bodies. The food production and biodiversity services exhibiting higher sensitivity to the changes in cropland, water regulation and soil formation and retention services show higher sensitivity to the changes in mixed vegetation cover. The current study has thoroughly evaluated the sensitivity and response behavior of six ecoregions of Sundarbans.

6863472,"Stock-Scale Electronic Tracking Of Atlantic Halibut Reveals Summer Site Fidelity And Winter Mixing On Common Spawning Grounds","Knowledge of movement ecology, habitat use, and spatiotemporal distribution is critical to inform sustainable fisheries management and conservation. Atlantic halibut in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) is of great economic value, although little is known about its spatiotemporal distribution, seasonal migrations, and spawning areas. To investigate these aspects, 114 pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) were deployed on halibut from 2013 up to 2018 throughout the GSL. A total of 62 physically recovered PSATs provided complete archived datasets with high temporal resolution. PSAT detachment locations revealed specific summer site fidelity. In contrast, the reconstruction of movement tracks with a geolocation model revealed that all fish converged to the Gulf's deep channels to overwinter and spawn. This suggests strong mixing during the spawning period and thus one reproductive population within the GSL. These findings illustrate the utility of large-scale PSAT tagging combined with dedicated PSAT-recovery surveys to reveal critical stock-scale information on movements and spawning locations. This information addresses important gaps in the movement ecology of this halibut stock, revealing that reported summer site fidelity, based on years of conventional tagging, also conceals important winter mixing that is only apparent through analyses of movement on the time scale of annual cycles.","{""Fisher, Jonathan A.

6862768,"An Assessment On The Change Of National Key Ecological Functional Zones Of Biodiversity Maintenance In 2011 And 2019","Timely evaluation of habitat quality on national key ecological function zones for biodiversity conservation is an important scientific basis for the strategic planning and implementation measures of national biodiversity conservation. In this study, three factors including structure and function of ecosystem, ecological stress from social activities and response of human, were given priority consideration in the process of constructing a comprehensive index system of biodiversity assessment combining with previous research and pressure-state-response (PSR) framework model. Also, all indicators were processed by using weighted processing and normalization method and the comprehensive evaluation method of regional biodiversity were constructed based on remote sensing and GIS technology. Finally, the habitat quality status were assessed on the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance in 2011 and 2019. The results show that:(1) The population emigration generally occupy the dominant position in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance from 2011 to 2019, but road net density has increased significantly. The human interference index and the fragmentation degree of ecological space increases accordingly. (2) The comprehensive index of biological diversity assessment (BDI) in all ecological function zones generally were maintained at above 0.4, and ecological environment quality status were in mid and good grade in 2011 and 2019. (3) The average BDI value of ecological function zones increased from 0.582 to 0.606, and the proportion of ecological function zones in the mid and good grade increased from 61.5% to 76.9% from 2011 to 2019. (4) The BDI value of two ecological function zones has decreased, occupied 15.4% from 2011 to 2019. In the last ten years, the habit qualities in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance generally presents a trend toward better change. But controlling density of population, road network construction and ecological space fragmentation, and the construction of protection pattern based on the new territorial space planning, still are the key issues of biological diversity protection within a certain period. But population density, is critical pressures to biodiversity protection during future period of time, and increasing the area of nature reserve and strictly controlling is an effective pathway to relieve the stress. This evaluation method and index system had the characteristics of strong timeliness, simple operation and high efficiency, which could better reflect the actual status and change characteristics of biodiversity in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance, and could be applied to regional scale biodiversity monitoring and evaluation. © 2021 Science Press.

6862724,"Desertification Risk Analysis And Assessment In Northern Nigeria","Changes in climatic conditions and human activities have led to increase in surface temperature, potential evapotranspiration and decrease in rainfall, thereby increasing desertification risk in the study area. Data used included Landsat images and meteorological data (1984–2015). Land use land cover change (LULCC) was estimated using maximum likelihood supervised classification. Land surface temperature (LST) was computed from thermal bands while desertification risk index was calculated using meteorological data from 5 weather stations and Normalized Differential Index (NDVI) values. The results from the LULCC revealed a significant reductions in rangeland by 13,418 Km2; while water body and rock out-crop were also affected by 1255 Km2 and 2592 Km2 respectively. The result also showed built-up and barren land with increase estimated at 5755 Km2 and 2016 11,512 Km2 respectively. LST increased by 2.8 °C from 1984 to 1999 and 2.7 °C from 1999 to 2014 with values at 43.8 °C in 1984, 46.6 °C in 1999 and 49.3 °C in 2015. A similar trend was observed from climatic data obtained while reduction in amount of rainfall was recorded over the years. Desertification Risk Index (DRI) was used to identify areas at risk with notable increase in 2014 encroaching south-ward. Desertification risk between 1984 and 1999 recorded the least threat with 1.32 and 8.53 as the lowest and highest risk rate while in 2014 it increased with the highest at 9.1 and the least value of 1.97.

6862978,"Forest Stand Spectrum Reconstruction Using Spectrum Spatial Feature Gathering And Multilayer Perceptron","Introduction: Three-dimensional spectral distributions of forest stands can provide spatial information on the physiological and biochemical status of forests, which is vital for forest management. However, three-dimensional spectral studies of forest stands are limited. Methods: In this study, LiDAR and multispectral data were collected from Masson pine stands in southern Fujian Province, China, and a method was proposed for inverting forest spectra using point clouds as a unit. First, multispectral values were mapped to a point cloud, and the isolated forest algorithm combined with K-means clustering was applied to characterize fusion data. Second, five deep learning algorithms were selected for semantic segmentation, and the overall accuracy (oAcc) and mean intersection ratio (mIoU) were used to evaluate the performance of various algorithms on the fusion data set. Third, the semantic segmentation model was used to reconfigure the class 3D spectral distribution, and the model inversion outcomes were evaluated by the peaks and valleys of the curve of the predicted values and distribution gaps. Results: The results show that the correlations between spectral attributes and between spatial attributes were both greater than 0.98, while the correlation between spectral and spatial attributes was 0.43. The most applicable method was PointMLP, highest oAcc was 0.84, highest mIoU was 0.75, peak interval of the prediction curve tended to be consistent with the true values, and maximum difference between the predicted value and the true value of the point cloud spectrum was 0.83. Discussion: Experimental data suggested that combining spatial fusion and semantic segmentation effectively inverts three-dimensional spectral information for forest stands. The model could meet the accuracy requirements of local spectral inversion, and the NIR values of stands in different regions were correlated with the vertical height of the canopy and the distance from the tree apex in the region. These findings improve our understanding of the precise three-dimensional spectral distribution of forests, providing a basis for near-earth remote sensing of forests and the estimation of forest stand health.

6862841,"An Air Quality Balance Index Estimating The Total Amount Of Air Pollutants At Ground Level","A new index named Air Quality Balance Index (AQBI), which is able to characterise the amount of pollution level in a selected area, is proposed. This index is a function of the ratios between pollutant concentration values and their standards; it aims at identifying all situations in which there is a possible environmental risk even when several pollutants are below their limit values but air quality is reduced. AQBI is evaluated by using a high-resolution three-dimensional dispersion model: the air concentration for each substance is computed starting from detailed emissions sources: point, line and area emissions hourly modulated. This model is driven with accurate meteorological data from ground stations and remote sensing systems providing vertical profiles of temperature and wind; these data are integrated with wind and temperature profiles at higher altitudes obtained by a Local Area Model. The outputs of the dispersion model are compared with pollutant concentrations provided by measuring stations, in order to recalibrate emission data. A three-dimensional high resolution grid of AQBI data is evaluated for an industrial area close to Alessandria (Northern Italy), assessing air quality and environmental conditions. Performance of AQBI is compared with the Air Quality Index (AQI) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. AQBI, computed taking into account all pollutants, is able to point out situations not evidenced by AQI, based on a preset limited number of substances; therefore, AQBI is a good tool for evaluating the air quality either in urban and in industrial areas. The AQBI values at ground level, in selected points, are in agreement with in situ observations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","{""Biamino, W."",""Borasi, M."",""Cavagnero, M."",""Musa, M."",""Rinaudo, C."",""Sesia, V."",""Trivero, P.""}","10.1007/s10661-011-2278-1",2024-07-12 19:25:59,"excluded","{""Data is not valued""}",2012,"{}","{""Air Pollutants"",""Air Quality Balance Index"",""Air concentrations"",""Air pollution"",""Air quality"",""Air quality index"",Alessandria,""Atmospheric movements"",Automobiles,""Dispersion models"",""Emission data"",""Environmental conditions"",""Environmental monitoring"",""Environmental risks"",""Ground level"",""Ground stations"",""High resolution"",""High-resolution grids"",Humans,""In-situ observations"",""Industrial area"",Industry,Italy,""Limit values"",""Measuring stations"",""Meteorological data"",Meteorology,""Models, Chemical"",""New indices"",""Northern Italy"",""Piedmont [Italy]"",""Pollutant concentration"",Pollution,""Pollution dispersion"",""Pollution dispersion model"",""Pollution level"",""Quality indices"",""Remote sensing"",""Remote sensing system"",""Temperature profiles"",""Three dimensional"",""Three-dimensional dispersion"",""U.S. Environmental Protection Agency"",""Vehicle Emissions"",""Vertical profile"",""air pollutant"",""air pollution control"",""air pollution indicator"",""analytic method"",article,""atmospheric pollution"",""environmental impact assessment"",""environmental parameters"",""ground-based measurement"",""index method"",""industrial district"",""meteorological phenomena"",modeling,""pollution monitoring"",temperature,""urban area"",wind}"
6903589,"Potential Of Using Data Assimilation To Support Forest Planning","Uncertainty in forest information typically results in economic and ecological losses as a consequence of suboptimal management decisions. Several techniques have been proposed to handle such uncertainties. However, these techniques are often complex and costly. Data assimilation (DA) has recently been advocated as a tool that may reduce the uncertainty, thereby improving the quality of forest planning results. It offers an opportunity to make use of all new sources of information in a systematic way and thus provides more accurate and up-to-date information to forest planning. In this study, we refer to literature on handling uncertainties in forest planning, as well as related literature from other scientific fields, to assess the potential benefits of using DA in forest planning. We identify five major potential benefits: (i) the accuracy of the information will be improved; (ii) the information will be kept up to date; (iii) the DA process will provide information with estimated accuracy; (iv) stochastic decision making can be applied whereby the accuracy of the information can be utilized in the decision making process; and (v) DA data allows for the analysis of optimal data acquisition decisions.",NA,"10.1139/cjfr-2016-0439",2024-09-26 01:04:48,"excluded","{""Valued data is not ESI""}",NA,"{}",NA

6903528,"Density-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm For Data Clustering","Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used in cluster analysis. However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",NA,"10.1016/j.eswa.2017.08.050",2024-10-01 17:52:43,"excluded","{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}",NA,"{}",NA

6863363,"Monitoring Of Urban Growth Of A Desert City Through Remote Sensing: Al-Ain, Uae, Between 1976 And 2000","The objective of this article is to investigate the development of Al Ain city, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), between 1976 and 2000, with particular reference to the space–time relationship. Al Ain is the fastest changing city in the Arabian Peninsula. It has gone from a desert oasis to a thriving modern city in just over 30 years. Maps, colour aerial photographs, satellite imagery, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used as an aid for understanding the development of the city. Change and development in the city is evident from comparison of old maps, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery taken during 1976, 1978, 1984, 1994, 1998 and 2000. The city was found to have a tendency for major expansion in the direction of the west and south-west. Expansion in any direction was found to be governed by the availability of utilities (water, electricity), economic activities along roads (agriculture, industry), geographical constraints (valleys, sand dunes, mountains), and legal factors (boundary with Sultanate of Oman, planning and institutional rules). Many cities around the world are developed at the cost of agricultural areas, which are the main source of food. For example, in Tempe, Arizona between 1970 and 1979 and in Cairo. However, in Al Ain the research concludes that the development is based on conservation of agricultural areas (oases) and reclamation of the desert. Revenue from oil is a significant drive for this development, but even more important is the determination of the UAE government to proceed with the development. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","{""Yagoub, M.

Then the data were organized in the form of a knowledge map. The research shows that the world cultural heritage site has the characteristics of distribution along the mountains and water systems, so it can refer to the geographical units, form the cultural heritage management and protection system with regional characteristics, and promote the sustainable development of the heritage site as a whole; Changes of the spatial distance between sites and cities or communities can be divided into three phases: the constant proximity period of 1990-2000, the slowdown in 2000-2015 and the acceleration of 2015-2018.The global world cultural heritage data were organized in the form of a knowledge map, which can support multiple attributes associated graph data mining and provide a basis for data reuse and deep processing. Based on the newly constructed data set, we also analyzed and verified the data set and knowledge map from the perspectives of the era and historical process of the heritage, the typical occurrence environment around the heritage, such as the distribution of mountains and water systems, and the changes of cities and communities, so as to meet the needs of global big data monitoring in the protection of world cultural heritage.

6863218,"Questionnaire Survey Of Hospitals In Saitama Prefecture Regarding The Shortage Of 99mtc-Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals And 99mo/99mtc Generators","Objective and methods A questionnaire survey was conducted at all 32 hospitals in Saitama Prefecture to investigate the current difficult situation in terms of nuclear medicine management in the face of the mTc shortage due to insufficient supply, and 29 hospitals (90.6%) replied. Results Of the 29, 15 (51.7%) reported a reduction in the number of nuclear medicine studies performed due to the shortage of supply, although the reduction was small. The decrease per month was less than 20 studies in 73% of the institutions. Of the nuclear medicine studies that involve the use of mTc, the studies whose reduction in number most seriously affected patient management were, in decreasing order: mTc-MAA lung perfusion scans, mTc-MAG3, mTc-DTPA, or mTc-DMSA renoscans, mTc-MDP bone scans, mTc-HMPAO or ECD brain SPECT studies, mTc-MIBI or tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT studies, mTc-radiocolloid sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, mTc-HSA-D or pyrophosphate bleeding scans, mTc-GSA hepatic function reserve scans, and mTc-MIBI parathyroid scans. The reduction is probably ascribable to factors such as cancellations of emergency studies, absence of substitute studies, sequential studies using the same radiopharmaceutical, and higher cost of the syringe-type products than the vial-type products. Substitutes for mTc studies were performed at 52% (15/29) of the institutions. Myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl chloride was the most common substitute study. Conclusions The results of this survey suggested the several procedures to resolve the issues related to the shortage. The staffs at all institutions except one gave the impression that their nuclear medicine ordering systems had been greatly affected by the shortage of supply. This adverse circumstance, however, may provide a good opportunity to educate the public about nuclear medicine studies that use mTc and SPECT, with which citizen are now unfamiliar. © The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine 2010.","{""Arai, T."",""Hayashi, K."",""Kita, T."",""Koike, K."",""Kosuda, S."",""Tomita, H.""}","10.1007/s12149-010-0347-0",2024-07-19 21:11:59,"excluded","{""ESI data not used""}",2010,"{""sentinel lymph node""}","{""<sup>m</sup>Tc-labeled radiopharmaceutical <sup>99</sup>Mo/<sup>m</sup>Tc generator"",Hospitals,Molybdenum,""Nuclear Medicine"",""Questionnaire survey"",Questionnaires,Radioisotopes,Radiopharmaceuticals,Reactor,Technetium,article,bleeding,""bone scintiscanning"",""brain scintiscanning"",""clinical trial"",""cost benefit analysis"",""cysteine ethyl ester tc 99m"",emergency,""health care delivery"",""health care survey"",""hexamethylpropylene amine oxime technetium tc 99m"",hospital,human,""liver function test"",""lung perfusion"",""lung scintiscanning"",lymphoscintigraphy,""medronate technetium tc 99m"",""methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m"",""molybdenum 99"",""multicenter study"",""myocardial perfusion imaging"",""parathyroid gland"",""parathyroid scintiscanning"",""patient care"",""priority journal"",questionnaire,""radioiodinated human serum albumin"",""sentinel lymph node"",""single photon emission computer tomography"",""succimer tc 99m"",""technetium 99m"",""tetrofosmin tc 99m""}"
