Abstract = {The evaluation and benchmarking of NoSQL databases is challenging due to
   the variety of query languages and also due to the denormalized scheme
   that allows to include non-scalar values and repeatable structures such
   as nested documents. In the rather young age of NoSQL databases, there
   are not many studies on a conventional solution to enable a fair
   comparison of their performance with each other and with relational
   databases. In this paper, we present the modeling and evaluation of an
   extensible open-source solution called NoWog. Its purpose is to generate
   large synthetic database workloads and also to mimic real-world database
   applications allowing application-specific benchmarking. We introduce a
   generic language for the description of workload characteristics that is
   independent of a particular database query language or the underlying
   storage model and therefore applicable to various database management
   systems. Thereby, the NoWog language covers different distributions of
   read and write operations for various data types such as numbers, texts,
   arrays and nested documents. In our evaluation, we demonstrate NoWog's
   ability to mimic a real workload from an application using environmental
   satellite data stored in a MongoDB and also its scalability to produce
   big workloads.},

Title = {A Shift to Human Body Temperature (37°C) Rapidly Reprograms Multiple
   Adaptive Responses in <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> That Would
   Facilitate Niche Survival and Colonization},

Abstract = {One of the first environmental cues sensed by a microbe as it enters a
   human host is an upshift in temperature to 37 degrees C. In this dynamic
   time point analysis, we demonstrate that this environmental transition
   rapidly signals a multitude of gene expression changes in Escherichia
   coli. Bacteria grown at 23 degrees C under aerobic conditions were
   shifted to 37 degrees C, and mRNA expression was measured at time points
   after the shift to 37 degrees C (t = 0.5, 1, and 4 h). The first hour is
   characterized by a transient shift to anaerobic respiration strategies
   and stress responses, particularly acid resistance, indicating that
   temperature serves as a sentinel cue to predict and prepare for various
   niches within the host. The temperature effects on a subset of stress
   response genes were shown to be mediated by RpoS and directly correlated
   with RpoS, DsrA, and RprA levels, and increased acid resistance was
   observed that was dependent on 23 degrees C growth and RpoS. By 4 h,
   gene expression shifted to aerobic respiration pathways and decreased
   stress responses, coupled with increases in genes associated with
   biosynthesis (amino acid and nucleotides), iron uptake, and host
   defense. ompT, a gene that confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides,
   was highly thermoregulated, with a pattern conserved in enteropathogenic
   and uropathogenic E. coli strains. An immediate decrease in curli gene
   expression concomitant with an increase in flagellar gene expression
   implicates temperature in this developmental decision. Together, our
   studies demonstrate that temperature signals a reprogramming of gene
   expression immediately upon an upshift that may predict, prepare, and
   benefit the survival of the bacterium within the host.
   IMPORTANCE As one of the first cues sensed by the microbe upon entry
   into a human host, understanding how bacteria like E. coli modulate gene
   expression in response to temperature improves our understanding of how
   bacteria immediately initiate responses beneficial for survival and
   colonization. For pathogens, understanding the various pathways of
   thermal regulation could yield valuable targets for antiinfective
   chemotherapeutic drugs or disinfection measures. In addition, our data
   provide a dynamic examination of the RpoS stress response, providing
   genome-wide support for how temperature impacts RpoS through changes in
   RpoS stability and modulation by small regulatory RNAs.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Although melanoma in childhood is a rare condition, there is
   evidence that it is increasing in frequency. As advances are being made
   in the understanding and therapy of adult melanoma, we need to consider
   the relevance of these advances to the pediatric population.
   Patients and Methods: We have reviewed our experience at the:University
   of Colorado Health Sciences Center with the clinical parameters,
   therapy, and outcomes of melanoma in 27 patients age 16 years or younger
   and contrasted these to the adult experience.
   Results: Most cases were diagnosed early with the median thickness of
   the primary melanoma being 0.75 mm. Six of seven patients who had lymph
   node metastases develop remain alive at a median follow-up of 62 months.
   Durable complete responses to a variety of therapies were seen in three
   of five patients with advanced disease outside the central nervous
   system. Our experience with sentinel node biopsy, adjuvant interferon,
   and new therapies for metastatic melanoma were also reviewed and appear
   to be relevant for younger patients.
   Conclusions: The behavior of melanoma in the pediatric population at our
   center is similar to that seen in adults. The integration of recent
   advances in the staging and therapy of melanoma in adults would be of
   benefit to children with this condition.},

Title = {Novel satellite based analytical model developed to predict microalgae
   yields in open pond raceway systems and applied to Canadian sites},
Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Interest in microalgae cultivation continues to increase based on its
   potential commercial value. Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and
   other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels,
   pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active
   compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in
   determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are
   fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict
   yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation
   systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower
   latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to
   cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets
   that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature
   measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To
   address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive
   analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on
   ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient
   temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production
   yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of
   central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model
   predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T
   biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat,
   AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake,
   NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL
   model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area
   information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs),
   techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR
   performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and
   can assist with algae production platform optimization.},

Title = {A high-resolution physical modelling approach to assess runoff and soil
   erosion in vineyards under different soil managements},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Steep-slope viticulture is a common practice in the Mediterranean basin,
   and provides landscapes of considerable socio-economic value. However,
   these complex agricultural systems are intrinsically fragile. One of the
   main problems is soil erosion due to extreme rainfall events. This may
   cause a progressive reduction in soil fertility and the occurrence of
   instabilities and land degradation phenomena. To worsen this condition
   there is the increasing mechanisation of agricultural management causing
   soil compaction, and the pressure of climate change, with an
   intensification of extreme weather events. In this context, vineyard
   soil management plays a key role, as it can accelerate or mitigate
   overland flow and soil erosion phenomena. There are various techniques
   for quantifying these processes, often based on field measurements
   through prolonged data collection using experimental plots. However, the
   advent of new technologies in remote sensing opens new frontiers in the
   acquisition of highresolution spatial data. Indeed, they could be used
   in runoff/erosion simulation models and integrated with site-specific
   data. The aim of this paper is to assess runoff and soil erosion
   processes in vineyard under four different soil managements.
   Specifically, four practices were tested: (1) Reference (inter-row
   managed with standard farm grass cover; RF); (2) Continuous Tillage
   (bare soil obtained by continuous mechanical weeding using roto-tiller;
   CT); Nectariferous (a mix of herbaceous species capable of attracting
   insects favouring inter-row biodiversity; NF); (4) Single Tillage
   (inter-row weeding once a year using roto-tiller; ST). The research
   proposes a modelling approach using a physically-based model (SIMWE)
   using samples of runoff and sediment as an assessment, collected with a
   low-cost methodology. In particular, a cost-effective approach easily
   replicable in different contexts (such as developing countries) is
   sought. In addition to cultivation specifics, areas of soil compacted by
   the passage of agricultural vehicles were also analysed using the
   connectivity index. In general, results show an interesting capacity of
   ST in mitigating soil erosion, as well as for NF. Furthermore, the
   negative role of wheel tracks as preferential pathways for surface
   runoff and sediment is highlighted. Finally, the work shows that CT
   aggravated soil erosion as compared to RF.},

Title = {The economic impact of tourism in Central Finland: a regional
   input-output study},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-547},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic
   impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper
   aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional
   output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional
   input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on
   regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional
   taxes in Central Finland.
   Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that
   tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland
   (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in
   different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on
   employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central
   Finland are quite significant.
   Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem
   from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate
   to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings,
   consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may
   overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism
   jobs are often low paying.
   Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to
   frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in
   planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use
   the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or
   improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries.
   Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at
   the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism
   impact studies using the input-output technique have also been
   conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the
   regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and
   employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have
   focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers
   (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional
   input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism
   expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the
   whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author
   also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The
   results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers
   involved in regional planning and development.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health
   care professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control
   hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women).
   Options: For people at risk for hypertension, there are a number of
   lifestyle options that may avert the condition-maintaining a healthy
   body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, exercising, reducing
   sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium, and
   reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce the
   risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the
   options for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification,
   antihypertensive medications or a combination of these options; with no
   treatment, these people remain at risk for the complications of
   hypertension.
   Outcomes: The health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure
   and in morbidity and mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence,
   no economic outcomes were considered.
   Evidence: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1966 to
   September 1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists
   were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors
   were used to identify other studies. All relevant articles were
   reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to
   level of evidence.
   Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular
   morbidity and premature death caused by untreated hypertension.
   Benefits, harms and costs: Lifestyle modification by means of weight
   loss (or maintenance of healthy body weight), regular exercise and low
   alcohol consumption will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected normotensive and hypertensive people. Sodium restriction and
   stress management will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected hypertensive patients. The side effects of these therapies are
   few, and the indirect benefits are well known. There are certainly costs
   associated with lifestyle modification, but they were not measured in
   the studies reviewed. Supplementing the diet with potassium, calcium and
   magnesium has not been associated with a clinically important reduction
   in blood pressure in people consuming a healthy diet.
   Recommendations: (1) It is recommended that health care professionals
   determine the body mass index (weight in kilograms/{[}height in
   metres](2)) and alcohol consumption of all adult patients and assess
   sodium consumption and stress levels in all hypertensive patients. (2)To
   reduce blood pressure in the population at large, it is recommended that
   Canadians attain and maintain a healthy body mass index. For those who
   choose to drink, alcohol intake should be limited to 2 or fewer standard
   drinks per day (maximum of 14/week for men and 9/week for women). Adults
   should exercise regularly (3) To reduce blood pressure in hypertensive
   patients, individualized therapy is recommended. This therapy should
   emphasize weight loss for overweight patients, abstinence from or
   moderation in alcohol intake, regular exercise, restriction of sodium
   intake and, in appropriate circumstances, individualized cognitive
   behaviour modification to reduce the negative effects of stress.
   Validation: The recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring
   organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth
   International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They are similar to
   those of the World Hypertension League and the Joint National Committee,
   with the exception of the recommendations on stress management, which
   are based on new information. They have not been clinically tested.

   High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, the Laboratory Centre for
   Disease Control at Health Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of

Abstract = {Introduction. This paper explores the notion and use of third space as
   conceptualised by Kuhlthau, Maniotes and Caspari on guided inquiry in
   information literacy and in human computer interaction literature.
   Creative processes are part in many academic disciplines. Information
   seeking triggers creativity in many ways, especially in learning
   processes. Virtual makerspaces can supplement educational virtual
   environments. This paper assesses the use of a third space lens for the
   planning of virtual makerspaces supporting academic creativity (based on
   findings from information behaviour studies), as seen from both
   information literacy and human computer interaction perspectives.
   Method. The paper is based on (i) findings from an empirical study in a
   creative academic context, (ii) scoping literature reviews of:
   creativity and information behaviour, search as learning, third space,
   and makerspaces.
   Analysis. Findings on information needs, information behaviour and
   creativity and search as learning are mapped against what an academic
   virtual makerspace can offer when applying a third space lens.
   Cognitive, affective, and physical perspectives are acknowledged.
   Findings. Both virtual academic makerspaces and third space holds value
   for information supportive environments for creativity and must build on
   findings on information behaviour.
   Conclusion. Further research should consider practical implementation.},

Pages = {11-21},
Abstract = {Infectious disease surveillance systems have embraced the Internet.
   ProMED-mail is a rapid reporting system of emerging infectious diseases
   in humans, animals, and plants. ProMED-mail relies on local news sources
   like newspapers and their web sites and local rapporteurs submitting
   reports of unusual events such as the first English language report of
   SARS. Each report on ProMED-mail is placed into perspective by an expert
   in the field and whether the report is credible or not is discussed.
   Provider-based surveillance of travelers has also become increasingly
   sophisticated. Monitoring disease trends geolocation of acquired
   diseases among travelers can inform both pretravel advice and posttravel
   management. Data from sentinel travelers upon their return to medically
   sophisticated environments can also benefit local populations in
   resource-limited countries. Networks such as GeoSentinel have provided
   cumulative trends in travel-related illness to assess pretravel risk for
   mass gathering events such as the Beijing Olympic Games or the FIFA
   World Cup in South Africa. Data provided by the GeoSentinel also helped
   in determining the seasonality of dengue by region of travel and risk of
   acquiring schistosomiasis by destination. Global surveillance of
   travel-related disease represents a powerful tool for the detection of
   infectious diseases. Such data should encourage clinicians to take a
   detailed travel history during every patient encounter.},

Title = {Models of Earth's main magnetic field incorporating flux and radial
   vorticity constraints},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-144},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We describe a new technique for implementing the constraints on magnetic
   fields arising from two hypotheses about the fluid core of the Earth,
   namely the frozen-flux hypothesis and the hypothesis that the core is in
   magnetostrophic force balance with negligible leakage of current into
   the mantle. These hypotheses lead to time-independence of the integrated
   flux through certain `null-flux patches' on the core surface, and to
   time-independence of their radial vorticity. Although the frozen-flux
   hypothesis has received attention before, constraining the radial
   vorticity has not previously been attempted. We describe a
   parametrization and an algorithm for preserving topology of radial
   magnetic fields at the core surface while allowing morphological
   changes. The parametrization is a spherical triangle tesselation of the
   core surface. Topology with respect to a reference model (based on data
   from the Oersted satellite) is preserved as models at different epochs
   are perturbed to optimize the fit to the data; the topology preservation
   is achieved by the imposition of inequality constraints on the model,
   and the optimization at each iteration is cast as a bounded value
   least-squares problem. For epochs 2000, 1980, 1945, 1915 and 1882 we are
   able to produce models of the core field which are consistent with flux
   and radial vorticity conservation, thus providing no observational
   evidence for the failure of the underlying assumptions. These models are
   a step towards the production of models which are optimal for the
   retrieval of frozen-flux velocity fields at the core surface.},

Title = {Haul-Out Behaviour of the World's Northernmost Population of Harbour
   Seals (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) throughout the Year},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {The harbour seal population in Svalbard occurs at the northernmost limit
   of the species' range. It experiences environmental extremes far beyond
   the norm for this species, including an extended period of polar night
   and extensive sea ice cover. In 2009 and 2010, 60 harbour seals (30 pups
   + 30 immature/mature seals) from this population were equipped with
   Satellite-Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) to study their haul-out behaviour,
   with a special focus on the winter period. Using a combination of
   Generalized Additive Mixed Models and Cox Proportional Hazard models,
   the influences of sex, maturity, temporal, spatial and environmental
   factors on haul-out behaviour were explored. All of the seals continued
   to haul out even through the coldest periods during the polar night,
   though clear seasonality in the time spent hauled out daily was
   displayed by both immature and mature seals. Time spent hauled out daily
   decreased from similar to 5.2 hrs in September to similar to 1.2 hrs in
   February in these age groups, while pups displayed less seasonality
   (similar to 2.4 hrs/day throughout most of the year). The average at-sea
   period also exhibited seasonality, increasing to a maximum of similar to
   1.6 days in February (monthly maxima for individual animals ranged from
   7 to 19 days). The seals showed a strong preference to haul out at low
   tide when hauling out on land but not when using sea ice as a haul-out
   platform. A diel rhythm in haul-out behaviour was present during the
   months with day-night cycling and midnight sun but not during the polar
   night. Haul-out behaviour was impacted to a greater extent by air
   pressure, through its effect on wind speed, than by absolute temperature
   values. The extreme environment in Svalbard likely causes some
   physiological challenges that might impact survival rates negatively,
   particularly among pups. Climate warming is likely to have positive
   effects on Svalbard's harbour seal population.},

Title = {Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, soil carbon stock and control variables in
   managed and degraded pastures in central Brazil},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Brazil has 166 million hectares of pastures, 58.8\% (97.6 million
   hectares) of which are in some degree of degradation. Besides the low
   animal support capacity and vegetative yield, degraded pastures also
   contribute significantly to soil carbon losses, through CO2 emission.
   This study aimed to understand the temporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2
   in contrast between degraded pastures (DP) and managed pastures (MP) in
   the Cerrado Brazil biome. Using the Pasture Atlas and 6-year time
   series, the variables were collected under the pasture classes:
   column-average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (xCO2),
   Soil Carbon Stock (SCS), as well as Solar-induced Chlorophyll
   Fluorescence (SIF), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
   Leaf Area Index (LAI) as vegetative characteristics, and Land Surface
   Temperature Amplitude (LST Amplitude) and Precipitation as climatic
   aspects. Except for xCO2, MP was significantly different from DP with
   higher SIF, NDVI, LAI, Precipitation, and SCS, but smaller LST
   Amplitude. The hypothesis test (Student t-test p < 0.05) results
   indicate higher Precipitation and SCS in MP when compared to DP due to
   its positive effect of higher vegetative values. Linear regression and
   Pearson's correlation analysis indicate that xCO2 negatively relates to
   the precipitation and vegetative variables (NDVI, LAI, and SIF), but
   positively with LST Amplitude and SCS. Soil carbon stock obtained a
   significant xCO2 relationship (p < 0.001) only in the DP, suggesting
   that the environmental stress experienced by degraded pastures impacts
   soil carbon losses as a source of CO2. Therefore, this study concludes
   that DP with carbon stored in the soil is the main source of CO2 for the
   atmosphere when compared to MP. So, if the necessary care is not taken,
   the organic carbon from these degraded pastures will be lost to the
   atmosphere as CO2. These findings may favor nature-based solutions
   indicating that proper pasture management is an important aspect to
   mitigate emissions and improving soil carbon content helping to mitigate
   atmospheric CO2.},

Abstract = {The Bush Administration of the United States recently released a revised
   National Space Policy. Although the revised National Space Policy can be
   interpreted as a step towards the weaponization of space, it does not
   necessarily weaponize space. It nonetheless brings to the forefront

   space. The present international law matrix on the issue of space-based
   weapons is to be found in international space law, principally in the
   Outer Space Treaty, where certain prohibitions apply to nuclear weapons
   and to weapons of mass destruction, Space must also be used for the
   benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their
   degree of economic or scientific development. Space objects must be
   registered in accordance with the Registration Convention. The UN
   collective security system and the customary right of self-defence
   govern the use of force or jus ad bellum. The means and methods through
   which self-defence is exercised are in turn governed by international
   humanitarian law. Should space be weaponized the basing of these weapons
   and their use will be subject not only to international space law but
   also to the UN Charter and to international humanitarian law. The
   interface between these legal regimes consequently gains in importance,
   possibly forcing a reinterpretation of certain space treaties along with
   a correction in state practice.},

Abstract = {Processes of terrestrial geologic mapping and preparation of geologic
   maps are supported by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and
   respective datamodels of which an assessable number are currently
   available. Such datamodels help mappers to define spatial geologic map
   units by integrating field and remote-sensing information and relate
   them to non-spatial information about unit details, in particular rock
   composition, age and age relationships, attitude data, and other
   characteristics. Apart from any interpretive tasks concerned with the
   delineation of various surface units in terms of geological and
   geomorphological boundaries and contents, basic mapping tasks involve an
   efficient management of attribute data needed for (1) applying an
   assignment of standardized cartographic symbols or color schemes, (2)
   performing spatial queries and data analyses, or for (3) combining and
   homogenizing mapping results generated by different groups. A unit
   usually carries multiple assignments to which an appropriate
   cartographic symbology representation is related. Such an assignment may
   describe the surface unit material, its stratigraphic name and relative
   position, or its chronostratigraphic and absolute position. The
   assignments of surface materials or the assignments of stratigraphic
   units within or without an absolute chronologic context and the
   subsequent selection of cartographic symbols can usually be handled
   using a standard geologic relationship model for which surface materials
   are the most important attributes. The complexity grows significantly if
   a data model needs to be employed which is capable of dealing with all
   such requirements at the same time and which is able to guide the mapper
   through entities and attribute values by employing object-relational
   concepts.
   We here present a geologic mapping data model design that has been
   implemented within Environmental Systems Research Institute's (ESRI)
   ArcGIS environment for systematic mapping conduct of different planetary
   surfaces. The model copes with each planet's specific stratigraphic
   system, surface chronologies, specific naming conventions, and different
   body references. Additionally, standards developed by the Federal
   Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) for cartographic symbols in geologic
   mapping have been implemented on an abstract level and are incorporated
   via subtype-domain controls to achieve a high level of integrity of
   attribute data.},

Abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall
   vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and
   nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological
   models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the
   required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping
   is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we
   therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM)
   methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation
   types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca.
   324,000 km(2). Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different
   VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular
   plots of 0.9 km(2). Distribution models for each VT were obtained by
   logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection
   with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in
   100 m x 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by
   applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results
   Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest
   AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest,
   whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather
   spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than
   common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones.
   Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial
   prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a
   regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided
   relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential
   uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international
   vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may
   improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system
   models.},

Abstract = {Climate change has made The Gambia vulnerable to drought hazard.
   Variability and negative trends in rainfall quantity and mid-season dry
   spells mainly attributed to the impacts of climate change. The
   inadequacy in hydrometeorological information puts the agricultural
   sector at a high risk which employs over 70\% of the population. The aim
   of this study was to establish the intensity and spatiotemporal pattern
   of drought in The Gambia from 2000 to 2020 using multiple drought
   indices. Rainfall data, satellite images, and government policy
   documents were analyzed to determine the state of drought in The Gambia.
   Rainfall data, using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and
   Precipitation Anomaly Percentage (PAP) were calculated and interpolated,
   and satellite images were processed using Vegetation Condition Index
   (VCI) to determine drought intensity and spatial distribution. The
   findings revealed that drought exists in The Gambia at moderate levels
   of SPI values (- 1.00 to - 1.49), (35\% of PAP), and VCI of no drought
   intensity of more than 35\%. The most drought prone areas in The Gambia
   are North Bank Region and Eastern parts of country in both north and
   south of The Gambia River banks. Recommendations of adaptation practice
   both on-farm and off-farm such as damming and economic diversification
   was drawn from other parts of the world, to reduce the negative effects
   of drought hazard in The Gambia.},

Title = {The long-term development of temperate woodland creation sites: from
   tree saplings to mature woodlands},
Journal = {FORESTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tree planting is at the forefront of the current environmental agenda to
   mitigate climate change and tackle the biodiversity crisis. In the
   United Kingdom (UK), tree planting has been a priority for more than a
   century and has helped increase woodland cover from a historic low of 5
   per cent at the beginning of the 20th century to a current figure of 13
   per cent. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term
   development of woodland creation sites (particularly of native
   woodlands) over ecologically realistic timescales. We surveyed a
   chronosequence of 133 temperatewoodland patches encompassing 106woodland
   creation sites (10-160 years old) and 27 mature `ancient' woodlands
   (>250 years old), using a combination of field surveys and remote
   sensing techniques to quantify vegetation structural changes associated
   with woodland development. Woodland creation sites displayed similar
   vegetation development patterns to those described for other woodland
   systems, i.e. a gradual transition as woodlands undergo `stand
   initiation', `stem exclusion' and `understorey reinitiation' stages, and
   became more similar to `ancient' woodlands over time. Structural
   heterogeneity, average tree size and tree density were the attributes
   that varied the most among woodland developmental stages. In general,
   structural heterogeneity and average tree size increased with woodland
   age, whilst tree density decreased as would be expected. Younger sites
   in stand initiation were strongly dominated by short vegetation, stem
   exclusion sites by taller trees and older sites had a more even
   vegetation height distribution. There was a large degree of overlap
   between the vegetation characteristics of woodlands in understorey
   re-initiation stages and older ancient woodlands (partly driven by a
   lack of regeneration in the understorey); these results suggest that it
   takes between 80 and 160 years for woodland creation sites to develop
   certain vegetation attributes similar to those of mature ancient
   woodlands included in this study. Woodland management practices to
   create canopy gaps and reducing grazing/browsing pressure to promote
   natural regeneration are likely to accelerate this transition, increase
   the structural heterogeneity and biodiversity value ofwoodland creation
   sites and enable adaptation and resilience to climate change.},

Abstract = {Operational oceanography has become an option and a reality to an extent
   which was not possible a decade ago. Modern techniques now allow for the
   collection of new types of especially ``green{''} data. Data are
   transferred from remote locations using satellite links to support
   operational applications both in oceanography and in meteorology.
   Operational oceanography is comparable to weather forecasting in
   meteorology. As a consequence issues such as synoptic data collection,
   uniform data-quality, real-time transmission of data, data management,
   data assimilation in numerical models, assessment and forecasting and
   finally the dissemination of products tot users, are also relevant in
   operational oceanography.
   In this paper the performance and future of the Seawatch system is
   described. Seawatch is a result of the Eureka/Euromar partnership.
   Seawatch Europe was in operations from 1990-1994. It was partly
   operational and partly experimental. Valuable experience was gained in
   operating large scale regional monitoring systems. Daily reports were
   distributed to different users, weekly reports were issued and
   distributed widely, quarterly and annual reports were issued for
   in-depth presentations of the marine environment as deducted from the
   data obtained by the Seawatch buoy network.
   A strong point of Seawatch is that it is commercially off-the-shelf and
   state-of-the-art technology. In a report of the Organisation for
   Economic Go-operation and Development (OECD, 1996) the benefits of the
   Seawatch system are clearly demonstrated. The global potential for the
   Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a
   running costs of \$ 100 million per year. Within the Intergovernmental
   Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the initiator of the Global Ocean
   Observing System (GOOS), Seawatch is seen as an important building block
   for GOOS, with special relevance to the marine meteorology and
   oceanographic forecasting, the health of the ocean, and the coastal zone
   management modules.},

Title = {REVIEW OF MAN-MADE MINERAL FORMATIONS ACCUMULATION AND PROSPECTS OF
   THEIR DEVELOPING IN MINING INDUSTRIAL REGIONS IN UKRAINE},
Journal = {MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-38},
Abstract = {Purpose. Analysis of the man-made mineral formations of ore mining and
   smelting, fuel and energy complexes development accumulation, location
   and prospects amount in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
   Methods. Comprehensive approach, including analysis of state statistics,
   waste handling sites (WHSs), regional environmental report,
   environmental passport of the region, as well as data from other
   information sources is used in the work. Aerial photographs of man-made
   formations were obtained using the Google Earth 7.1.8 satellite program.
   Findings. The analysis of the main man-made mineral formations of ore
   mining and smelting, fuel and energy complexes accumulation in Ukraine
   (coal and mining industry waste heaps, tailing dumps, ash dumps, smelter
   slag dumps) was conducted, their amount and occupied areas were
   estimated. According to the densest location of man-made formations,
   they are divided into 4 regions: the Prydniprovsk region, the Kryvyi Rih
   region, the Nikopol region, the Pavlohrad region. According to
   information sources, the content of some valuable components in man-made
   formations has been established. Based on the world market prices of
   technogenic deposits components research, it was proposed to grade them
   according to the cost of valuable components. The promising directions
   have been proposed for the use of mineral resources in various economic
   sectors. It is noted that from the perspective of development of mineral
   and raw materials potential, the bulk formations are of interest because
   of their large reserves in the minimum area. But from the perspective of
   environmental protection and the interests of the Ukrainian people, the
   bulk technogenic formations occupying significant areas of agricultural
   land and having smaller mineral reserves are of great interest.
   Originality. The conception of man-made raw material mineral fund for
   further industrial development as an alternative to natural deposits is
   extended and systematized. For the first time, an integrated and
   detailed analysis has been performed of technogenic waste of the largest
   waste storage region in Ukraine, as well as the grouping has been
   proposed of mining and energy sector waste by density of location and by
   the contained components value.
   Practical implications. A sketch-map of the man-made objects location
   was drawn up and their gradation was carried out according to the
   preliminary prospects of their development. This will provide a more
   objective approach to the concept of industrial waste development and
   planning the strategy for the development of mineral and raw materials
   potential both at the state and regional levels.},

Title = {Multi-source satellite imagery and point of interest data for poverty
   mapping in East Java, Indonesia: Machine learning and deep learning
   approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach to provide a more granular poverty
   map in terms of coverage (up to a grid level with the spatial resolution
   of 1.5 km) with less cost and time to update to support better poverty
   monitoring. Two poverty estimation model development scenarios using
   machine learning and deep learning were evaluated in this study. First,
   the model is constructed using multisource satellite imagery and
   geospatial point of interest location of economic in-frastructures using
   zonal statistics feature extraction, which is the proposed approach in
   this study. The specific multisource satellite imagery to be used as
   poverty indicators are night-time light intensity (NTL) as an approach
   to economic activity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as
   an approach to detect rural areas based on vegetation, built-up index
   (BUI) as an approach to detect urban areas based on building
   distribution, normalized difference water index (NDWI) to detect land
   cover, land surface temperature (LST) as an approach to detecting urban
   areas based on surface temperature, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an approach to detecting
   economic activities based on pollution, as well as point of interest
   (POI) density, and POI distance which show the accessibility of an area.
   Second, the model is constructed from daytime multiband and nighttime
   light intensity satellite imagery using the deep learning architecture
   of Resnet-34 transfer learning feature extraction. In each scenario, we
   compared the performance of different machine learning (support vector
   regression/SVR, decision tree regression/DTR, and random forest
   regression/RFR) algorithms along with deep learning (multiple layer
   perceptron/MLP and one dimensional-convolutional neural network/ CNN-1D)
   algorithms. Based on the results of the model development evaluation,
   the CNN-1D model was chosen as the best model in the first scenario, and
   the Resnet-34 + MLP model was chosen as the best model in the second
   scenario. The two best models from the first and second scenarios are
   then used to predict poverty at the grid level with a spatial resolution
   of 1.5 km. Based on official poverty data, the estimated poverty mapping
   built using the CNN-1D model in the first scenario was chosen as the
   best map with the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.95 and
   adjusted R2 0.84 at the district level. The results of visual
   identification revealed that high estimates of poverty are typically
   found in sparsely inhabited areas surrounded by unoc-cupied land, which
   is usually an agricultural area. Otherwise, low poverty estimates, on
   the other hand, are more likely to be found in highly populated regions
   with convenient access. Our finding is aligned with the official report
   of Statistics Indonesia, which claims that poverty in rural re-gions is
   higher than in urban areas.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {299},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization and population growth in Hanoi city raise the demand
   for groundwater and the risk of land subsidence. This study is the first
   to conduct a long-term interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
   analysis with different SAR sensors including ALOS, COSMO-SkyMed and
   Sentinel-1 to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of subsidence in
   Hanoi between 2007 and 2018. The results show that subsidence in Central
   Hanoi had been diminishing during these 12 years, while the southern and
   western outskirts (Ha Dong and Hoai Duc district) had become hot spots
   with peak rates of \~{}50 mm/yr. We further model the subsidence
   time-series with 22 years of piezometric records to estimate
   hydrogeological properties in the area. The modeling yields a mean
   consolidation coefficient of 0.56 m2/yr, a value typical for aquitards
   composed of > 90\% fine-grain materials. The model also predicts another
   0.5-1.3 m of subsidence in Ha Dong by the end of this century. Based on
   these results, we propose zoning for subsidence susceptibility as the
   basis for future groundwater management in Hanoi. From a regional
   perspective, Hanoi is relatively less affected by land subsidence
   compared to other South East Asian cities due to geotechnical factors
   including small consolidation coefficients, as well as social factors
   such as lower population density.},

Abstract = {Nature-based Climate Solutions (NbCS) are managed alterations to
   ecosystems designed to increase carbon sequestration or reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions. While they have growing public and private
   support, the realizable benefits and unintended consequences of NbCS are
   not well understood. At regional scales where policy decisions are often
   made, NbCS benefits are estimated from soil and tree survey data that
   can miss important carbon sources and sinks within an ecosystem, and do
   not reveal the biophysical impacts of NbCS for local water and energy
   cycles. The only direct observations of ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes,
   for example, by eddy covariance flux towers, have not yet been
   systematically assessed for what they can tell us about NbCS potentials,
   and state-of-the-art remote sensing products and land-surface models are
   not yet being widely used to inform NbCS policymaking or implementation.
   As a result, there is a critical mismatch between the point- and
   tree-scale data most often used to assess NbCS benefits and impacts, the
   ecosystem and landscape scales where NbCS projects are implemented, and
   the regional to continental scales most relevant to policymaking. Here,
   we propose a research agenda to confront these gaps using data and tools
   that have long been used to understand the mechanisms driving ecosystem
   carbon and energy cycling, but have not yet been widely applied to NbCS.
   We outline steps for creating robust NbCS assessments at both local to
   regional scales that are informed by ecosystem-scale observations, and
   which consider concurrent biophysical impacts, future climate feedbacks,
   and the need for equitable and inclusive NbCS implementation strategies.
   We contend that these research goals can largely be accomplished by
   shifting the scales at which pre-existing tools are applied and blended
   together, although we also highlight some opportunities for more radical
   shifts in approach.},

Abstract = {The Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) have the world's largest
   supply of floating algae. The green and golden tides appear mainly in
   the YS and ECS, respectively, but become entangled as they drift. The
   floating algae obstructs navigation and is a huge socioeconomic problem
   in the vicinity of coastal areas. To manage these floating algae more
   systematically, a method of distinguishing between the green and golden
   tides is required. In this study, the reflectivity characteristics of
   the green and golden tides appearing in the YS and ECS were investigated
   based on which a classification method was proposed and applied to
   satellite sensors. First, the reflectance of Ulva prolifera and
   Sargassum horneri was measured, which are the major causative species of
   the green and golden tides in the YS and ECS, respectively. Under
   visible light, the reflectance of U. prolifera increased at 555 nm, and
   that of S. horneri increased at 602 and 646 nm and decreased at 632 nm.
   To distinguish the two algae, slope of red-green (SRG) method was
   applied with the red and green reflectance slope. U. prolifera exhibited
   SRG that was always negative, whereas that of S. horneri was always
   positive. When SRG was applied to the difference in reflectance values
   between floating algae and nearby water detected in satellite imagery,
   the green tide was always negative, and the golden tide was always
   positive. Classification and detection of floating algae using
   multi-satellite sensors and SRG system can reduce the associated
   management cost and time.},

Abstract = {Flash floods are very abrupt and sudden and can devastate large areas
   with in fraction of seconds. Tsunami is also a grass root cause of
   infrastructure loss and casualties. Tsunami is caused by the release of
   energy inside the ocean. It has been observed that Tornados and Tsunami
   frequently occurred that caused more than 120000 casualties between 1992
   to 2005. Several approaches and cases have been studied and applied to
   overcome this topmost issue. Strong and reliable flood risk management
   system must have the capabilities to forecast and estimate the change in
   the process: the hydro atmospheric and climatic development that causes
   flood waves and land and metropolitan exposure that leads to casualties.
   Techniques utilized for the early investigation of flash floods may be
   classified into following categories a. Sensors and
   instrumentation-based b. Radar based c. Satellite images based. In this
   paper researchers presented a reliable and vigor cost-effective solution
   for the prediction of flash floods accurately and precisely by using
   direct measurements with the combination of scaled conjugate gradient
   back propagation. Researchers have adopted direct measurement method by
   utilizing couple of sensors named as PIR, ultrasonic sensor, water or
   humidity sensor, temperature and pressure sensors. Gas sensor has also
   been used to detect the increased carbon dioxide levels in the
   environment as soil is saturated more and the probability of flash flood
   occurrence becomes sure in this situation. An appropriate mixture of
   estimation sensors can extensively boost the benefit of information in
   contrast with that from a single sensor. 48 hours of data has been
   recorded and processed for the false alarm identification by using
   Scaled conjugate gradient back propagation. Results proved that our
   proposed system worked better or equivalent to the other available
   techniques with minimized error rate. Results showed that it performed
   better than the existing approaches. Multi layer perceptron (MLP) was
   applied on the same data set for the error and false alarm
   classification. Results were compared with the multi-layer perceptron
   and it can be easily observed that they are close enough therefore
   scaled conjugate gradient back propagation performed very well.},

Abstract = {The coffee crop spectral behavior identification throughout its cycle
   can contribute to its development monitoring under pest incidence. We
   aim to identify coffee development through time signatures of enhanced
   vegetation index (EVI), as well as to evaluate the use of seasonal
   autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models to identify
   coffee trees spectrum-time patterns under different irrigation
   management and design future scenarios. Three coffee fields were
   selected under different irrigation systems, whose EVI data of 8 years
   were obtained from the moderate resolution image spectroradiometer
   sensor. Each coffee crop model was subjected to residual autocorrelation
   test and classified according to information criteria, while its
   accuracy was assessed by means of prediction error measures and
   agreement index. The estimated and observed EVI values were similar,
   even for the predicted year. However, in agricultural years during which
   coffee diseases occurred, the crops showed vegetative vigor below the
   expected. We concluded that SARIMA models enabled the establishment of a
   reliable spectral signature expected for coffee crop, which could help
   with crop management defining, regardless of the irrigation system
   adopted. Based on the evaluation of divergence between expected and
   observed spectral signatures, early signs of coffee underdevelopment
   were detected, which could reduce economic loss risks on its commercial
   chain. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {There are numerous uses of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS):
   navigation, of course, but also various optimizations, such as routing
   or handover protocols in telecommunication networks. Moreover, energy
   saving approaches may also be based on the use of the locations of the
   various entities involved. Most of the time, the positioning is
   considered to be ``perfect{''}: no uncertainty on the values, sometimes
   leading to inappropriate results and conclusions concerning the
   above-mentioned optimizations. This paper intends to provide the various
   communities with a simple, proved and easy to use statistical model of
   the error distributions of the GPS positioning. A large measurement
   campaign has been carried out in order to provide the model with a
   representative base of GPS data. The receiver used is a ublox 6T for raw
   data and it has been associated with the free RTKLIB software for data
   processing. We have highlighted that a specific parameter, called
   ``Cost{''} and defined in the paper, can be used in order to completely
   define the model. Since this parameter can be estimated from the
   receiver, the model can thus either be used in real time or in post
   processing, or even included in any optimization scheme. The proposed
   model has been validated in various environmental conditions that have a
   great impact on the distributions of the positioning error and on the
   accuracy of GPS receivers.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether different intensities of organic matter
   removal associated with timber harvest influence decadal-scale storage
   of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the top 1m of
   mineral soil 18years postharvest in a Pinus taeda L. forest in the Gulf
   Coastal Plain. We quantified forest harvest-related changes in SOC, TN,
   microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and nitrogen (MBN) pools (0-100cm) in
   unharvested control stands and in two organic matter removal treatment
   stands subjected to either (i) merchantable bole/stem-only harvest or
   (ii) whole-tree harvest+forest floor removal. In addition, C-13 of SOC
   and N-15 of TN were measured in mineral soil to provide insights
   regarding mechanisms that might explain changes in SOC and TN pool
   sizes. Soils were sampled seasonally for 1year. Increasing organic
   matter removal intensity reduced SOC, TN, MBC, and MBN relative to the
   unharvested control. Furthermore, soils from whole-tree harvest+forest
   floor removal stands had lower C-13 and higher N-15 values, suggesting
   that increasing organic matter removal may decrease heterotrophic
   activity as well as increase rates of N loss. Seasonal variabilities in
   SOC and TN were correlated to changes in forest biological properties
   such as root biomass and forest floor mass. These results indicate that
   more intensive harvest methods may lead to decade-scale decreases in SOC
   and TN storage in surface and subsurface soils which could influence
   rates of biogeochemical processes, the availability of soil nutrients,
   and potential forest productivity.},

Title = {Quantification of Above-Ground Biomass over the Cross-River State,
   Nigeria, Using Sentinel-2 Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Higher-resolution wall-to-wall carbon monitoring in tropical Africa
   across a range of woodland types is necessary in reducing uncertainty in
   the global carbon budget and improving accounting for Reducing Emissions
   from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+). This study uses
   Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery combined with climatic and edaphic
   variables to estimate the regional distribution of aboveground biomass
   (AGB) for the year 2020 over the Cross River State, a tropical forest
   region in Nigeria, using random forest (RF) machine learning. Forest
   inventory plots were collected over the whole state for training and
   testing of the RF algorithm, and spread over undisturbed and disturbed
   tropical forests, and woodlands in croplands and plantations. The
   maximum AGB plot was estimated to be 588 t/ha with an average of 121.98
   t/ha across the entire Cross River State. AGB estimated using random
   forest yielded an R-2 of 0.88, RMSE of 40.9 t/ha, a relRMSE of 30\%,
   bias of +7.5 t/ha and a total woody regional AGB of 0.246 Pg for the
   Cross River State. These results compare favorably to previous tropical
   AGB products; with total AGB of 0.290, 0.253, 0.330 and 0.124 Pg,
   relRMSE of 49.69, 57.09, 24.06 and 56.24\% and -41, -48, -17 and -50
   t/ha bias over the Cross River State for the Saatchi, Baccini, Avitabile
   and ESA CCI maps, respectively. These are all compared to the current
   REDD+ estimate of total AGB over the Cross River State of 0.268 Pg. This
   study shows that obtaining independent reference plot datasets, from a
   variety of woodland cover types, can reduce uncertainties in local to
   regional AGB estimation compared with those products which have limited
   tropical African and Nigerian woodland reference plots. Though REDD+
   biomass in the region is relatively larger than the estimates of this
   study, REDD+ provided only regional biomass rather than pixel-based
   biomass and used estimated tree height rather than the actual tree
   height measurement in the field. These may cast doubt on the accuracy of
   the estimated biomass by REDD+. These give the biomass map of this
   current study a comparative advantage over others. The 20 m wall-to-wall
   biomass map of this study could be used as a baseline for REDD+
   monitoring, evaluation, and reporting for equitable distribution of
   payment for carbon protection benefits and its management.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable in the terrestrial water and energy
   system. This study presents an hourly index that provides soil moisture
   estimates on a high spatial and temporal resolution (1 km x 1 km). The
   long established Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) is extended with
   soil characteristic and temperature dependent loss functions. The
   Soilgrids and ERA5 data sets are used to provide the controlling
   variables. Precipitation as main driver is provided by the German
   weather radar data set RADOLAN. Empiric variables in the equations are
   fitted in a optimization effort using 23 in-situ soil moisture
   measurement stations from the Terrestial Environmental Observatories
   (TERENO) and a separately conducted field campaign. The volumetric soil
   moisture estimation results show error values of 3.45 Vol\% mean ubRMSD
   between RADOLAN\_API and station data with a high temporal accordance
   especially of soil moisture upsurge. Further potential of the improved
   API algorithm is shown with a per-station calibration of applied
   empirical variables. In addition, the RADOLAN\_API data set was
   spatially compared to the ESA CCI soil moisture product where it
   altogether demonstrates good agreement. The resulting data set is

Title = {Assessment of the lobster puerulus (<i>Panulirus homarus</i> and
   <i>Panulirus ornatus</i>, Decapoda: Palinuridae) resource of Indonesia
   and its potential for sustainable harvest for aquaculture},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {528},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Indonesia has a unique opportunity to establish the world's largest
   lobster aquaculture industry, based on a significant natural resource of
   settling puerulus. These seed lobsters can be captured and on-grown to
   generate high value, consumption size lobsters. However, existing
   fisheries regulation prohibits fishing of these seed lobsters in
   Indonesia. Nevertheless, seed fishing occurs widely, and the seed are
   smuggled into Vietnam, where the Vietnamese gain most of the commercial
   benefit. By removing access to pueruli and grow-out opportunities, these
   regulations have diminished the capacity of Indonesian lobster farmers
   to develop a sustainable grow-out industry. Although the new policies
   were introduced as a management intervention to protect adult lobster
   stocks, they have had the unintended consequence of preventing
   development of lobster aquaculture while having no known benefit on
   abundance of adult lobsters. This study collected data on the puerulus
   available in Indonesia, species composition, seasonality, and capture
   methods.
   A census of seed capture determined that 5,243,887 pueruli were fished
   from two bays in the southeast of Lombok in 2014, representing 64,787
   pueruli per km(2). Surveys beyond Lombok determined there was high
   abundance of seed in areas with similar environmental characteristics,
   where local communities had also engaged in seed fishing. The locations
   identified as having substantial puerulus abundance comprised the
   southern coast of Java, Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa covering a distance of
   1500 km. Puerulus abundance is highest in enclosed bays with distinct
   currents, relatively high turbidity attributable to terrestrial inflows,
   and muddy/sandy substrates. Satellite imaging identified all such
   suitable locations for puerulus settlement, enabling an estimate of
   total puerulus catch of 103,480,283 per year. The composition of
   puerulus fished consisted of two species, Panulirus homarus and P.
   ornatus. P. homarus was most abundant representing between 63 and 87\%,
   while P. ornatus represented 37 to 13\%. Seasonality of catch was
   unclear, with low catch between December and March and higher catches
   from April to November. The magnitude of the estimated puerulus resource
   of Indonesia is > 20 times greater than that of Vietnam. If used for
   aquaculture, the seed available can support an industry generating >
   12,500 t of market size lobster, and provide social and economic benefit
   to many thousands of households. To achieve this, fisheries policies
   could be revised and a regulatory framework established to manage the
   puerulus fishery and support lobster farming. Tropical marine rock
   lobster aquaculture is a major opportunity for high-value aquaculture

Title = {Factors influencing residential location choice: learnings from the
   Indian context},
Journal = {OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 22},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of the present study is to explore the factors that
   influence the residential location choice of households in the Indian
   context.Design/methodology/approachTwo sub-urban towns of Kolkata, i.e.
   Biddhanagar Municipal Corporation and Rajarhat Newtown, are taken as
   case studies. In total, 34 variables are considered related to the
   household's socioeconomic background (10), dwelling (3), travel (2) and
   level of importance of neighborhood characteristics (19). A revealed
   preference household survey is conducted, which resulted in the
   collection of 390 samples. Firstly, 19 level of importance variables are
   deduced to 3 latent factors using exploratory and confirmatory factor
   analysis. After that, a utility function is estimated using a
   multinomial logit regression to identify significant factors.FindingsThe
   results indicate the significance of car ownership, work travel time,
   work mode, monthly income, proximity to work, proximity to
   family/relative/friends, proximity to quality schools, quality of
   physical infrastructure such as water availability, power availability
   and housing typology among others in the residential location choice of
   households.Research limitations/implicationsKolkata, a major
   metropolitan area in eastern India, has been experiencing space
   constraints to cater to the housing demand of the ever-increasing
   population. Although satellite towns are being developed, the
   infrastructure landscape in such towns is uneven, resulting in more
   housing demand in one area than another. The study furnishes significant
   findings to develop more informed policies to attract households in
   low-demand areas and manage high-demand areas to achieve sustainable
   planning.Originality/valueConsidering the importance of geographical
   context, it is the first study on residential location choice, providing
   a perspective of household behavior from eastern India. It also shows
   the importance of physical infrastructure attributes in residential
   location choice for developing countries, which is seldom employed in
   the current practice. Moreover, previous studies (although few) done in
   India consider the objective value of location characteristics. The
   present study focuses on subjective value or the level of importance
   perceived by respondents.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was designed to
   identify tornado vortices based on their characteristics that were
   determined from the Doppler spectra and eigenvalues that were calculated
   from the data that were collected in the vicinity of these vortices. To
   collect these data, weather surveillance radar (WSR-88D) was employed,
   which is locally operated by the National Severe Storms Laboratory
   (NSSL) on the north campus of the University of Oklahoma, Norman. This
   particular radar, which is devoted to experimental research rather than
   operational weather forecasting, has the unique capability of recording
   massive volumes of in-phase (1) and quadrature (Q) data over many hours.
   As such, the received radar echo power and Doppler shift information can
   be determined from these I and Q complex-valued data, which provides a
   rich environment for evaluating our new postprocessing algorithms. At
   the current time, most radar systems, including North America's national
   network of weather radar systems, process these I and Q data in real
   time to produce environmental measurements known as ``spectral
   moments,{''} which are the first three statistical moments of the data.
   These three moments (the reflectivity, the radial velocity, and the
   spectrum width) are then provided to scientists, or forecasters, and the
   abundance of I and Q data is not preserved to save computer resources.
   One of the aims of this paper is to show how additional information
   about the atmosphere can be garnered from the I and Q data. To assist
   this mission, an SVM-based classifier evades the pitfalls of the
   traditional statistical learning algorithms, such as neural networks, by
   setting up a convex optimization problem with a single global minimum.
   In addition, through the use of kernels and a nonlinear mapping to
   higher dimensional spaces, the SVM classifier is able to effectively
   handle nonlinear classification problems. The idea behind this
   transformation is to facilitate the separability of classes by taking
   the input vectors to a higher dimensional space. The SVM classifier has
   the added advantage of reducing overfitting by constructing a maximum
   margin to separate hyperplanes in a higher dimensional feature space to
   ensure a small generalization error bound. Finally, our practical
   results are in positive agreement with our theoretical predictions.},

Title = {Assessing the transition from deforestation to forest regrowth with an
   agent-based model of land cover change for south-central Indiana (USA)},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {819-832},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Midwest and Northeast United States has experienced a net increase
   in forest cover since the beginning of the 20th century. However, we
   lack a detailed understanding of the transition to net forest cover
   increase because this forest regrowth occurred prior to the use of tools
   like household-level surveys focused on land use decision-making and
   availability of remote sensing data. Agent-based modeling presents an
   appealing means to explore what social and biophysical dynamics may have
   contributed to this forest regrowth process. In this paper we employ an
   agent-based model to analyze the process of forest regrowth in
   south-central Indiana from 1939 to 1993. Simulation results are
   presented for assumptions regarding pre-existing forest age and the
   stand age at which landowners harvest timber with a goal of
   understanding the influence of these factors on future trajectories of
   land cover change. The results demonstrate both the value and the burden
   of having many time points to evaluate the success of the model. Is the
   best simulation the one with the smallest net residuals across all time
   points? Or is the best simulation the one that best reproduces the
   correct trajectory of land cover change for each time interval? Model
   simulations that assume a harvesting frequency of 30 years all produced
   landscapes within 2\% of the actual forest cover in 1993, the end point
   of the study period. However, the trajectories of these simulations did
   not all mimic the gradual forest regrowth found in our observed data.
   The model simulation with the smallest residual values across all time
   points assumed a initial forest age of 5 years in 1939 and a harvesting
   frequency of 30 years. Ultimately, we cannot definitively conclude that
   one model simulation is a better representation of reality than another
   because we have no way of comprehensively validating the model
   assumptions. However, we can more plausibly conclude that the age of
   forest regrowth in 1939 and the frequency of timber harvesting by
   landowners both had an influence on the successive trajectory of land
   cover change in the study area. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Variability in White Shark (<i>Carcharodon
   carcharias</i>) Movement Ecology During Residency and Migration Phases
   in the Western North Atlantic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {08},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Understanding how mobile, marine predators use three-dimensional space
   over time is central to inform management and conservation actions.
   Combining tracking technologies can yield powerful datasets over
   multiple spatio-temporal scales to provide critical information for
   these purposes. For the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), detailed
   movement and migration information over ontogeny, including inter- and
   intra-annual variation in timing of movement phases, is largely unknown
   in the western North Atlantic (WNA), a relatively understudied area for
   this species. To address this need, we tracked 48 large juvenile to
   adult white sharks between 2012 and 2020, using a combination of
   satellite-linked and acoustic telemetry. Overall, WNA white sharks
   showed repeatable and predictable patterns in horizontal movements,
   although there was variation in these movements related to sex and size.
   While most sharks undertook an annual migratory cycle with the majority
   of time spent over the continental shelf, some individuals, particularly
   adult females, made extensive forays into the open ocean as far east as
   beyond the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Moreover, increased off-shelf use
   occurred with body size even though migration and residency phases were
   conserved. Summer residency areas included coastal Massachusetts and
   portions of Atlantic Canada, with individuals showing fidelity to
   specific regions over multiple years. An autumn/winter migration
   occurred with sharks moving rapidly south to overwintering residency
   areas in the southeastern United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico,
   where they remained until the following spring/summer. While broad
   residency and migration periods were consistent, migratory timing varied
   among years and among individuals within years. White sharks monitored
   with pop-up satellite-linked archival tags made extensive use of the
   water column (0-872 m) and experienced a broad range of temperatures
   (-0.9 - 30.5 degrees C), with evidence for differential vertical use
   based on migration and residency phases. Overall, results show dynamic
   inter- and intra-annual three-dimensional patterns of movements
   conserved within discrete phases. These results demonstrate the value of
   using multiple tag types to track long-term movements of large mobile
   species. Our findings expand knowledge of the movements and migration of
   the WNA white shark population and comprise critically important
   information to inform sound management strategies for the species.},

Abstract = {Along the US border with Mexico there are thousands of communities
   designated by the federal government as colonias, a name that highlights
   the large numbers of low-income, Hispanic immigrants that live in these
   communities. These subdivisions have been studied extensively in recent
   years, often using insights from the concept of urban informality. This
   research has highlighted the challenges posed by exploitative land sales
   practices, poor-quality or non-existent infrastructure and poor-quality
   housing in these communities. However, similar informal subdivisions
   exist along the urban fringe elsewhere across the US, though they are
   not designated as colonias by the federal government and scholars rarely
   consider their similarities to colonias in the border region. This study
   uses data on Census Designated Places from the American Community
   Survey, satellite imagery and county property records to examine the
   extent and nature of these subdivisions. The results illustrate that
   informal land development of the sort described here is not restricted
   only to the border region, to immigrant enclaves or to Hispanic
   communities. Instead, it is demonstrated that informal subdivisions
   exist in large numbers across Southern and Western states and, though
   their numbers are smaller, they are present even in the Midwest and
   Northeast. Moreover, these subdivisions are home to diverse populations
   and they provide important benefits such as expanded opportunities of
   homeownership for minorities and the poor.},

Abstract = {FAA, industry and the user community are currently developing
   performance standards for GPS-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance
   Broadcast (ADS-B). Of concern is the possibility of significant error in
   apparent aircraft separation when the ADS-B position reports are based
   on slightly different sets of satellites but a fault on a common
   satellite goes undetected by RAIM algorithms in both aircraft. This
   paper provides an in-depth analysis of the performance of solution
   separation RAIM in the above circumstance. The analysis characterizes
   the conditional risk that given a fault occurs, it goes undetected by
   both RAIM algorithms and the total separation error (including a
   fault-free component) exceeds a given level. The dependence of this
   conditional separation error risk on the correlation between the two
   RAIM decision statistics is derived in detail. Examples of problematic
   satellite geometries (rare, but use could be permitted) are evaluated.
   Some of these geometries have positive RAIM correlation and thus, joint
   RAIM missed detection (P-md) performance worse than if the RAIM decision
   statistics were totally independent (negligible correlation). Some other
   geometries have negative correlation and therefore joint RAIM P-md
   performance better than if independent. While the resulting conditional
   separation risk probabilities are of interest, no performance
   requirement or standards currently exist to which conditional risk may
   be compared. Therefore, a previously developed concept of total risk is
   evaluated to compare ADS-B performance to current surveillance radar.
   This total risk considers both fault-free and faulted conditional risk
   and the prior probability of each circumstance. The application of
   interest is surveillance to achieve the 3.0 nmi separation standard in
   the terminal area. Total ADS-B risk is evaluated based on two different
   prospective values of the RAIM Horizontal Alert Limit (HAL) which
   corresponds to the radius of containment (Rc) associated with ADS-B
   position reports. The values of HAL are 0.5 nmi and 0.6 nmi, both of
   which may be associated with an ADS-B navigation integrity category
   (NIC) of 6. For HAL = 0.6 nmi, total risk is found to be slightly worse
   than radar for risk probabilities smaller than about 10(-5) if the RAIM
   correlation is positive or negligible. For HAL = 0.6 and negative
   correlation or for all correlation cases with HAL = 0.5 nmi the ADS-B
   total separation error risk is always at least as good as radar. The
   analysis also includes an example of receivers designed assuming SA on
   (even though it is not). For receivers designed assuming SA on, total
   ADS-B separation risk is as good as radar, even for HAL = 0.6 nmi.},

Title = {The potential distribution of cassava mealybug (<i>Phenacoccus
   manihoti</i>), a threat to food security for the poor},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The cassava mealybug is a clear and present threat to the food security
   and livelihoods of some of the world's most impoverished citizens. Niche
   models, such as CLIMEX, are useful tools to indicate where and when such
   threats may extend, and can assist with planning for biosecurity and the
   management of pest invasions. They can also contribute to bioeconomic
   analyses that underpin the allocation of resources to alleviate poverty.
   Because species can invade and establish in areas with climates that are
   different from those that are found in their native range, it is
   essential to define robust range-limiting mechanisms in niche models. To
   avoid spurious results when applied to novel climates, it is necessary
   to employ cross-validation techniques spanning different knowledge
   domains (e.g., distribution data, experimental results, phenological
   observations). We build upon and update a CLIMEX niche model by Parsa et
   al. (PloS ONE 7: e47675), correcting inconsistent parameters and
   re-fitting it based on a careful examination of geographical
   distribution data and relevant literature. Further, we consider the role
   of irrigation, the known distribution of cassava production and a
   targeted review of satellite imagery to refine, validate and interpret
   our model and results. In so doing, we bring new insights into the
   potential spread of this invasive insect, enabling us to identify
   potential bio-security threats and biological control opportunities. The
   fit of the revised model is improved, particularly in relation to the
   wet and dry limits to establishment, and the parameter values are
   biologically plausible and accord with published scientific literature.},

Title = {Effects of Enclosure on Grassland Ecological and Economic Benefits in
   Northern China},
Journal = {CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 23},
Abstract = {Grasslands in northern China serve the country as both an ecological
   barrier and a livestock production base. There, installing enclosures
   has been becoming the major grassland restoration measure adopted by
   many local governments. However, the effects of restoration on both
   ecological and production benefits of grassland remain unclear for
   implemented grassland restoration policies. Therefore, a representative
   rangeland in northern China, the Maodeng pasture in Inner Mongolia
   Autonomous Region was selected as the study area, and remote sensing
   monitoring analyses were carried out to quantify the ecological benefits
   and economic benefits from 2015 to 2021. The results showed that: 1) in
   terms of ecological benefits, the grassland area with a grassland
   coverage rate of more than 60\% accounts for 32.3\% of the regional
   area, and 86.4\% of its grassland grew significantly better than the
   same period in 2015, showing a significant improvement in grassland
   growth. Using the average amount of carbon per unit area as the
   ecological benefit evaluation index, it increased by 27.1\% to 32.48Tg
   C/yr from 2015 to 2021. 2) In terms of economic benefits, both
   theoretical grass production and livestock carrying capacity increased
   from 2015 to 2021. Compared to 2015, the theoretical grass production in
   2021 increased by 24.8\% to 71 900 t. The livestock carrying capacity
   reached 52 100 sheep units in 2021, nearly 11 000 sheep units more than
   that in 2015. During the study period, multiple economic indicators (on
   a per capita basis of permanent residents) for the pastoral area of
   Xilin Hot City to which the Maodeng pasture belongs, have grown
   steadily. Per capita total income rose from 29 630 yuan (RMB) in 2015 to
   62 859 yuan (RMB) in 2021. Relying on grassland resources to develop the
   pastoral ecology also broadens the potential economic development space.
   Overall, the establishment of the reserve and the experiment of
   implanting an enclosure policy have had a significant and positive
   impact on Maodeng pasture's development from both an ecological and
   economic perspective. With the support of scientific evidence, enclosure
   policy can be extended to more than 110 000 km2 of grasslands in
   northern China with similar precipitation and temperature conditions,
   enhancing the productive and ecological potential of grasslands. The
   above research results will contribute to the scientific formulation of
   grassland pasture quality improvement plans in northern China.},

Title = {Comparison of Global and Continental Land Cover Products for Selected
   Study Areas in South Central and Eastern European Region},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Land cover is one of the key terrestrial variables used for monitoring
   and as input for modelling in support of achieving the United Nations
   Strategical Development Goals. Global and Continental Land Cover
   Products (GCLCs) aim to provide the required harmonized information
   background across areas; thus, they are not being limited by national or
   other administrative nomenclature boundaries and their production
   approaches. Moreover, their increased spatial resolution, and
   consequently their local relevance, is of high importance for users at a
   local scale. During the last decade, several GCLCs were developed,
   including the Global Historical Land-Cover Change Land-Use Conversions
   (GLC), the Globeland-30 (GLOB), Corine-2012 (CLC) and GMES/ Copernicus
   Initial Operation High Resolution Layers (GIOS). Accuracy assessment is
   of high importance for product credibility towards incorporation into
   decision chains and implementation procedures, especially at local
   scales. The present study builds on the collaboration of scientists
   participating in the Global Observations of Forest CoverGlobal
   Observations of Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC-GOLD), South Central and
   Eastern European Regional Information Network (SCERIN). The main
   objective is to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of commonly used
   GCLCs at selected representative study areas in the SCERIN geographic
   area, which is characterized by extreme diversity of landscapes and
   environmental conditions, heavily affected by anthropogenic impacts with
   similar major socio-economic drivers. The employed validation strategy
   for evaluating and comparing the different products is detailed,
   representative results for the selected areas from nine SCERIN countries
   are presented, the specific regional differences are identified and
   their underlying causes are discussed. In general, the four GCLCs
   products achieved relatively high overall accuracy rates: 74-98\% for
   GLC (mean: 93.8\%), 79-92\% for GLOB (mean: 90.6\%), 74-91\% for CLC
   (mean: 89\%) and 72-98\% for GIOS (mean: 91.6\%), for all selected
   areas. In most cases, the CLC product has the lower scores, while the
   GLC has the highest, closely followed by GIOS and GLOB. The study
   revealed overall high credibility and validity of the GCLCs products at
   local scale, a result, which shows expected benefit even for
   local/regional applications. Identified class dependent specificities in
   different landscape types can guide the local users for their reasonable
   usage in local studies. Valuable information is generated for advancing
   the goals of the international GOFC-GOLD program and aligns well with
   the agenda of the NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program to improve the
   quality and consistency of space-derived higher-level products.},

Abstract = {Vegetation plays an important role in the aggregate carbon balance of
   fires, according to a 1901 to 2010 land surface model study that,
   assuming steady state, shows potentially greater pyrogenic carbon
   production than legacy losses at global scale, due mostly to grassland
   adaptations to fire.
   Recently identified post-fire carbon fluxes indicate that, to understand
   whether global fires represent a net carbon source or sink, one must
   consider both terrestrial carbon retention through pyrogenic carbon
   production and carbon losses via multiple pathways. Here these legacy
   source and sink pathways are quantified using a CMIP6 land surface model
   to estimate Earth's fire carbon budget. Over the period 1901-2010,
   global pyrogenic carbon has driven an annual soil carbon accumulation of
   337 TgC yr(-1), offset by legacy carbon losses totalling -248 TgC
   yr(-1). The residual of these values constrains the maximum annual
   pyrogenic carbon mineralization to 89 TgC yr(-1) and the pyrogenic
   carbon mean residence time to 5,387 years, assuming a steady state. The
   residual is negative over forests and positive over grassland-savannahs
   (implying a potential sink), suggesting contrasting roles of vegetation
   in the fire carbon cycle. The paucity of observational constraints for
   representing pyrogenic carbon mineralization means that, without
   assuming a steady state, we are unable to determine the sign of the
   overall fire carbon balance. Constraining pyrogenic carbon
   mineralization rates, particularly over grassland-savannahs, is a
   critical research frontier that would enable a fuller understanding of
   fire's role in the Earth system and inform attendant land use and
   conservation policy.},

Title = {Vertical and horizontal habitat use by white marlin <i>Kajikia
   albida</i> (Poey, 1860) in the western North Atlantic Ocean},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {72},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2364-2373},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on 40 white marlin Kajika
   albida (synonym: Tetrapturus albidus) off the coasts of Maryland and
   North Carolina (United States), and the island nation of Aruba in the
   Caribbean. Useful data were available for analysing vertical and
   horizontal habitat use from 28 individuals. Time at liberty ranged from
   10 to 181 d (mean 115, SD 53.3). Seasonal southerly fall migration
   routes were documented for fish released off the northeastern United
   States, while those released off Aruba remained in the Caribbean basin.
   Horizontal movements ranged from 228 to 8084 km (19-100 km d(-1)) based
   on light-level geolocation estimates using a sea surface temperature and
   bathymetry-corrected Kalman filter. Analyses included an evaluation of
   vertical movements using Delta T, the time spent at temperature relative
   to the uniform temperature surface layer. Movements included exploration
   of depths as great as 387 m and ambient temperatures as low as 7.8
   degrees C. However, the greatest proportion of time was spent in the
   upper 20 m of the water column for both day (50.8\%) and night (81.6\%),
   and time spent in water colder than 7 degrees C below the uniform
   temperature surface layer was negligible. Overall, this group showed
   less variability in vertical movement, and less tolerance to colder
   temperatures compared with similar studies for blue marlin Makaira
   nigricans and sailfish Istiophorus platypterus. Values for Delta T are
   presented in tabular format to allow direct input into habitat
   standardization models used to estimate vertical distribution and
   population abundance. The large spatial dispersion and disparate tracks
   illustrated in the present study serve to underscore the complexity of
   white marlin behaviour and habitat use, and further emphasize the many
   challenges facing the management and conservation of this overexploited
   species.},

Title = {Modeling multi-decadal mangrove leaf area index in response to drought
   along the semi-arid southern coasts of Iran},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {656},
Pages = {1326-1336},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Leaf Area Index (LAI, as an indiator of the health) of the mangrove
   ecosystems on the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of
   Oman was measured in the field and modeled in response to observed
   (1986-2017) and predicted (2018-2100) drought occurrences (quantified
   using the Standardized Precipitation Index {[}Sil]). The relationship of
   LAI with the normalized difference vegetation index (NINO obtained from
   satellite images was quantified, the LA! between 1986 and 2017
   retrospectively estimated, and a relationship between lAl and SPI
   developed for the same period. Long-term climate data were used as input
   in the RCP8.5 climate change scenario to reconstruct I ecent and
   forecast future drought intensities. Both the NEVI and the SPI were
   strongly related with the LAI, indicating that realistic LAI values were
   derived from historic satellite data to portray annual changes of LAI in
   response to changes in SPI. Our findings show that projected future
   drought intensities modeled by the RCP8.5 scenario increase more and
   future LAIs decreased more on the coasts of the Gulf of Oman than the
   coasts of the Persian Gulf in the coming decades. The year 1998 was the
   most significant change-point for mean annual rainfall amounts and
   thought occurrences as well as for lAls and at no time between 1998 and
   2017 or between 2018 and 2100 are SP! and values expected to return to
   pre-1998 values. and SPI are projected W decline sharply around 2030,
   reach their lowest levels between 2040 and 2070, and increase and
   stabilize during the late decades of the 21st century at values similar
   to the present time. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive
   picture of the responses of mangroves to fluctuating future drought
   conditions, facilitating the development of management plans for these
   vulnerable habitats in the face of future climate change. Crown

Abstract = {Precise management of nitrogen (N) using canopy color in aerial imagery
   of corn (Zea mays L.) has been proposed as a strategy on which to base
   the rate of N fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the relationship between canopy color and yield response to N at the
   field scale. Six N response trials were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in
   fields with alluvial, claypan and deep loess soil types. Aerial images
   were taken with a 35-mm slide film from a parts per thousand yen1100 m
   at the mid- and late-vegetative corn growth stages and processed to
   extract green and red digital values. Color values of the control N (0
   kg N ha(-1)) and sufficient N (280 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting)
   treatments were used to calculate the relative ratio of unfertilized to
   fertilized and relative difference color values. Other N fertilizer
   treatments included side-dressed applications in increments of 56 kg N
   ha(-1). The economic optimal N rate was weakly related (R (2) a parts
   per thousand currency sign 0.34) or not related to the color indices at
   both growth stages. For many sites, delta yield (the increase in yield
   between control N and sufficient N treatments) was related to the color
   indices (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.67) at the late
   vegetative growth stage; the best relationship was with green relative
   difference. The results indicate the potential for color indices from
   aerial photographs to be used for predicting delta yield from which a
   site-specific N rate could be determined.},

Title = {Knowledge-Based Landslide Susceptibility Zonation System},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {The landslide susceptibility of a region is important for socioeconomic
   considerations and engineering applications. Thus, an automated system
   for mapping of landslide susceptibility could be of significant benefit
   for society. In this paper, a knowledge-based landslide susceptibility
   zonation (LSZ) system has been proposed. The system consists of input,
   understanding, expert, and output modules. The input module accepts
   thematic images of contributing factors for landslides. The
   understanding module interprets input images to extract relevant
   information as required by the expert module. The expert module consists
   of knowledge base and inference strategy to categorize a region into
   different landslide intensities. Finally the output module provides a
   LSZ map. It is a pixel-based system and provides output having the scale
   same as that of the input maps. The system has been tested to prepare a
   landslide susceptibility map for the Tehri-Garhwal region in India's
   lower Himalayas, and further validated with studies for two other
   different regions. The proposed system provides output commensurate with
   that provided by experts. The categories of hazard zones have a
   discrepancy as little as 6.2\% in high hazard zones and near to 1.5\%
   and 4\% in moderate and low hazard zones, respectively. The high hazard
   zones in the LSZ maps from the proposed system are supersets of that
   obtained by experts (i.e., the proposed system provides safer LSZ map).
   Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed system can be used for
   preparation of LSZ maps. In the future, the methodology may be extended
   for real time assessment and prediction of landslide hazards.},

Title = {Estimation of the Yield and Plant Height of Winter Wheat Using UAV-Based
   Hyperspectral Images},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Crop yield is related to national food security and economic
   performance, and it is therefore important to estimate this parameter
   quickly and accurately. In this work, we estimate the yield of winter
   wheat using the spectral indices (SIs), ground-measured plant height
   (H), and the plant height extracted from UAV-based hyperspectral images
   (H-CSM) using three regression techniques, namely partial least squares
   regression (PLSR), an artificial neural network (ANN), and Random Forest
   (RF). The SIs, H, and H-CSM were used as input values, and then the
   PLSR, ANN, and RF were trained using regression techniques. The three
   different regression techniques were used for modeling and verification
   to test the stability of the yield estimation. The results showed that:
   (1) H-CSM is strongly correlated with H (R-2 = 0.97); (2) of the
   regression techniques, the best yield prediction was obtained using
   PLSR, followed closely by ANN, while RF had the worst prediction
   performance; and (3) the best prediction results were obtained using
   PLSR and training using a combination of the SIs and H-CSM as inputs
   (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 648.90 kg/ha, NRMSE = 10.63\%). Therefore, it can be
   concluded that PLSR allows the accurate estimation of crop yield from
   hyperspectral remote sensing data, and the combination of the SIs and
   H-CSM allows the most accurate yield estimation. The results of this
   study indicate that the crop plant height extracted from UAV-based
   hyperspectral measurements can improve yield estimation, and that the
   comparative analysis of PLSR, ANN, and RF regression techniques can
   provide a reference for agricultural management.},

Title = {The prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer: a
   systematic review protocol},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Background: Lynch syndrome is the most common inherited cancer syndrome,
   which predisposes individuals to a number of different cancers,
   principally colorectal and endometrial cancer. The early diagnosis of
   Lynch syndrome enables colorectal surveillance, which has been shown to
   save lives through the detection and removal of premalignant polyps and
   earlier detection of invasive disease. Endometrial cancer, which is
   often the sentinel cancer in women, provides an opportunity to diagnose
   Lynch syndrome and thus enable colorectal surveillance as well as the
   cascade testing for Lynch syndrome in other family members. These
   potential benefits have led to a call for the universal screening of
   women with endometrial cancer for Lynch syndrome, a practice that is now
   commonplace in colorectal cancer. Healthcare providers and clinicians
   are however restricted by insufficient knowledge about the prevalence of
   Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer, with estimates varying
   as widely as 1-10\%. The aim of this study is to perform a systematic
   review with a meta-analysis of the current literature base in order to
   estimate the prevalence of Lynch syndrome among women with endometrial
   cancer to inform this discussion.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
   (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, NHS Health and Technology
   Assessment Database and the Web of Science will be systematically
   searched for relevant studies via the Ovid platform. Two authors will
   review the titles and abstracts independently, with discrepancy settled
   by a third author. Data extraction will be completed to record
   demographic, pathological and clinical data, as well as the diagnostic
   methods used for estimating the prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women
   with endometrial cancer. Bias will be assessed and recorded using the
   Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and that of the International Cochrane
   Collaboration. Dependent on the heterogeneity of the data, we aim to
   produce a cumulative incidence in addition to subgroup analyses as to
   investigate secondary outcomes.
   Discussion: The aim of this systematic review is to provide a robust
   estimate of the prevalence of Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial
   cancer. This will enable resource allocation and decision-making
   regarding the appropriateness of screening all women, or certain women,
   with endometrial cancer for Lynch syndrome. Such a policy could enable
   the earlier diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in women and, through the
   application of colorectal cancer surveillance, improve their survival
   outcomes.},

Title = {An evaluation of the Zambia influenza sentinel surveillance system,
   2011-2017},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Background Over the past decade, influenza surveillance has been
   established in several African countries including Zambia. However,
   information on the on data quality and reliability of established
   influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information
   would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance
   systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of
   data reliability for policy making and public health interventions.
   Methods We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance
   system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011-2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data
   quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness,
   (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability,
   (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated
   using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the
   proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the
   total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each
   attribute as follows: < 60\% (as obtained in the calculation above)
   scored 1 (weak performance); 60-79\% scored 2 (moderate performance); >=
   80\% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute
   and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated
   attributes. Results The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was
   2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated
   (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral
   pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8),
   acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review
   period and its relatively low cost (\$310,000 per annum). Identified
   weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0),
   timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote
   sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds.
   Conclusions The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key
   improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples
   shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would
   result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia
   is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of
   maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require
   evaluation.},

Title = {Current costs of dialysis modalities: A comprehensive analysis within
   the United Kingdom},
Journal = {PERITONEAL DIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {578-584},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Previous evidence suggests home-based dialysis to be more
   cost-effective than unit-based or hospital-based dialysis. However,
   previous analyses to quantify the costs of different dialysis modalities
   have used varied perspectives, different methods, and required
   assumptions due to lack of available data. The National Institute for
   Health and Care Excellence reports uncertainty about the differences in
   costs between home-based and unit-based dialysis. This uncertainty
   limits the ability of policy makers to make recommendations based on
   cost effectiveness, which also impacts on the ability of budget holders
   to model the impact of any service redesign and to understand which
   therapies deliver better value. The aim of our study was to use a
   combination of top-down and bottom-up costing methods to determine the
   direct medical costs of different dialysis modalities in one UK nation
   (Wales) from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS).
   Methods: Detailed hybrid top-down and bottom-up micro-costing methods
   were applied to estimate the direct medical costs of dialysis modalities
   across Wales. Micro-costing data was obtained from commissioners of the
   service and from interviews with renal consultants, nurses, accountants,
   managers and allied health professionals. Top-down costing information
   was obtained from the Welsh Renal Clinical Network (who commission renal
   services across Wales) and the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust. Results:
   The annual direct cost per patient for home-based modalities was 16,395
   pound for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 20,295 pound
   for automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and 23,403 pound for home-based
   haemodialysis (HHD). The annual cost per patient for unit-based
   modalities depended on whether or not patients required ambulance
   transport. Excluding transport, the cost of dialysis was 19,990 pound
   for satellite units run in partnership with independent sector providers
   and 23,737 pound for hospital units managed and staffed by the NHS. When
   ambulance transport was included, the respective costs were 28,931 pound
   and 32,678 pound, respectively. Conclusion: Our study is the most
   comprehensive analysis of the costs of dialysis undertaken thus far in
   the United Kingdom and clearly demonstrate that CAPD is less costly than
   other dialysis modalities. When ambulance transport costs are included,
   other home therapies (APD and HHD) are also less costly than unit-based
   dialysis. This detailed analysis of the components that contribute to
   dialysis costs will help inform future cost-effectiveness studies,
   inform healthcare policy and drive service redesign.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Hospital overcrowding is an international crisis, and
   there are typically three indicators of this overcrowding. Some previous
   interventions for overcrowding were found to be incorrect due to a lack
   of vision; nevertheless, they are the foundation of modern
   interventions. Tu Du Hospital has had to deal with a huge influx of
   patients, resulting in the current overcrowding situation. As a result,
   solutions to counteract the problem of overcrowding immediately emerged,
   leading to free space in hospitals and benefits to overall public
   health.
   Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Tu Du Hospital in
   Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from May to July 2013. Patients, staffs, and
   managers recommended some solutions for hospital overcrowding, including
   building more facilities, improving the organization, developing
   satellite departments, and establishing family doctor networks.
   Result: A total of 200 inpatients, 100 medical staff members, and 88
   hospital managers were included in this study. Of the patients, 80.8\%
   choose the hospital for the high-tech facilities and 83.7\% for the
   skillful staff. About 42\% of patients accept with the overall quality
   of hospital.
   Conclusion: The survey proved that the overcrowding situation at Tu Du
   Hospital was actually a kind of ``fake{''} overcrowding. The plan is
   promoting countryside facilities that associated with Tu Du hospital the
   objectives must be set up following criteria. This research has
   uncovered the true form of overcrowding at Tu Du Hospital. A possible
   strategy for Tu Du Hospital going forward is the implementation of the
   three proposed interventions at various levels of the healthcare system
   in Vietnam.},

Title = {Exploring the effects of catchment morphometry on overland flow response
   to extreme rainfall using a 2D hydraulic-hydrological model (IBER)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {627},
Number = {A},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The hydrological response of a catchment to heavy rainfall is determined
   by many environmental and climatic variables, including the catchment
   size, shape and morphology, land use, soil depth and type, and
   prevailing weather conditions. As a result of the interaction between
   these variables, the hydrological response of a catchment is unique and
   can be highly variable depending on the antecedent conditions and
   characteristics of the meteorological event. This complexity makes it
   problematic to identify the significance of individual drivers of
   hydrological response. Here, the role of catchment morphometry in
   controlling hydrological response was explored by creating abstract
   catchments so the impact of morphometry could be isolated from the
   confounding impacts of other parameters that are known to impact
   hydrological response and flood risk. A procedure was developed to
   select catchments that represent a range of global morphometries, and
   these were then simplified and treated as synthetic catchments. A
   coupled hydrological-hydraulic model (IBER) was used to model the
   hydrological response to 4 constructed rainfall events (one magnitude,
   four distribution types), consistent across all catchments, and
   representing torrential rainfall (60 mm h-1). Designed rainfall were
   equally distributed across the whole area in each catchment. Catchments
   were statistically partitioned into groups based on their morphometry
   (i.e. shape, slope, size, hypsometric slope, etc) and distinct
   hydrological responses were observed between groups. Catchment size was
   significantly related to peak flow or lag time with a power law, in line
   with previous studies, and relationships with other morphometric
   parameters were stronger when catchments were assessed in separate size
   groupings. Area and the average slope of catchments were key parameters
   in controlling peak flow magnitudes. Variation in hydrological response
   was much greater between catchments for the same rainfall event, than
   within the same catchment for different rainfall events. The results
   suggest that hydrological response can be broadly characterised using
   morphometric variables, increasingly obtainable using Earth Observation
   methods, providing potential benefits for flood prediction, flood
   alerts, and focusing where more detailed flood modelling is required.},

Title = {An identification and a prioritisation of geographic and temporal data
   gaps of Mediterranean marine databases},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {668},
Pages = {531-546},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Getting an overall view of primary data available from existing Earth
   Observation Systems and networks databases for the Mediterranean Sea,
   the main objective of this paper is to identify temporal and geographic
   data gaps and to elaborate a new method for providing a prioritisation
   of missing data useful for end-users that have to pinpoint strategies
   and models to fill these gaps. Existing data sources have been
   identified from the analysis of the main projects and information
   systems available. A new method to perform the data gap analysis has
   been developed and applied to the whole Mediterranean basin as case
   study area, identifying and prioritise geographical and temporal data
   gaps considering and integrating the biological, geological, chemical
   and physical branches of the total environment. The obtained results
   highlighted both the main geographical data gaps subdividing the whole
   Mediterranean Sea into 23 sub-basins and the temporal data gaps
   considering data gathered since 1990. Particular attention has been
   directed to the suitability of data in terms of completeness,
   accessibility and aggregation, since data and information are often
   aggregated and could not be used for research needs. The elaborated
   inventory of existing data source includes a database of 477 data rows
   originated from 122 data platforms analysed, able to specify for each
   dataset the related data typologies and its accessibility. The obtained
   results indicate that 76\% of the data comes from ongoing platforms,
   while the remaining 25\% are related to platforms with non-operational
   monitoring systems. Since the large amount of analysed records includes
   data gathered in inhomogeneous ways, the prioritisation values obtained

Title = {Quantifying the Impact of Hydrological Connectivity on Salt Marsh
   Vegetation in the Liao River Delta Wetland},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Salt marshes play a critical role in ecological functioning and have
   significant economic value. Hydrological elements are considered to be
   one of the major contributors to salt marsh degradation. However, how
   hydrological connectivity affects salt marshes remains poorly
   investigated at fine scales. This paper used spatial analysis and
   statistical methods to investigate the impact of hydrological
   connectivity on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of
   salt marsh vegetation in two natural succession areas of the Liao River
   Delta wetland in 2020 and 2021 by selecting vegetation area, NDVI, tidal
   creeks area, distance to tidal creeks, and the Index of Connectivity,
   using 1 m Gaofen-2 data and 0.2 m aerial topographic data. The study
   found that the area and growth status of vegetation and the overall
   connectivity in 2021 were better than that in 2020, while the west bank
   of the Liao River was better than that on the east bank. Phragmites
   australis showed a round island distribution pattern primarily at the
   end of tidal creeks. The differences between different hydrological
   connectivity and vegetation area were significant in 2021. The
   vegetation area was the largest under poor and moderate connectivity. We
   also found that within a distance range of 0-6 m from tidal creeks, the
   vegetation area increased with increasing distance, but beyond 6 m, the
   vegetation area decreased with increasing distance. Our results showed
   that poor and moderate connectivity conditions were more suitable for
   vegetation growth. The threshold value of 6 m can provide an important
   reference for wetland vegetation restoration in the Liao River Delta
   wetland.},

   Disease Stresses in Wheat Using a Soil Effect Removal Algorithm and

Abstract = {Wheat yellow mosaic disease is a low-temperature and soil-borne disease.
   Crop infection by the yellow mosaic virus can lead to severe yield and
   economic losses. It is easily confused with nitrogen deficiency based on
   the plant's morphological characteristics. Timely disease detection and
   crop management in the field require the precise identification of crop
   stress types. However, the detection of crop stress is often
   underappreciated. Wheat nitrogen deficiency and yellow mosaic disease
   were investigated in the field and wheat physiological and biochemical
   experiments were conducted to collect agronomic indicators, four years
   of reflectance spectral data at green-up and jointing were collected,
   and then studies for the detection of nitrogen deficiency and yellow
   mosaic disease stresses were carried out. The continuous removal (CR),
   first-order derivative (FD), standard normal variate (SNV), and spectral
   separation of soil and vegetation (3SV) preprocessing methods and 96
   spectral indices were evaluated. The threshold method and variance
   inflation factor (TVIF) were used as feature selection methods combined
   with machine learning to develop a crop stress detection method. The
   results show that the most sensitive wavelengths are found in the
   725-1000 nm region, while the sensitivity of the spectrum in the 400-725
   nm region is lower. The PRI670,570, B, and RARSa spectral indices can
   detect nitrogen deficiency and yellow leaf disease stress, and the OA
   and Kappa values are 93.87\% and 0.873, respectively, for PRI670,570,
   which is the best index. A 3SV-TVIF-SVM stress detection method was then
   proposed, using OA and Kappa values of 96.97\% and 0.931, respectively,
   for field data validation. The results of the study can provide
   technical support and a theoretical basis for the accurate control of
   yellow mosaic disease and nitrogen fertilizer management in the field.},

Title = {Lightning and Severe Weather: A Comparison between Total and
   Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Trends},
Journal = {WEATHER AND FORECASTING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {744-755},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many studies over the past several decades have attempted to correlate
   trends in lightning (e.g., rates, polarity) to severe weather
   occurrence. These studies mainly used cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning
   information due to the ease of data availability, high detection
   efficiency, and broad coverage across the United States, with somewhat
   inconclusive results. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that trends
   in total lightning are more robustly correlated to severe weather
   occurrence, with rapid increases in total lightning observed 10s of
   minutes prior to the onset of severe weather. Unfortunately, total
   lightning observations are not as numerous, or available over the same
   areal coverage domain, as provided by CG networks. Relatively few
   studies have examined concurrent trends in both total and CG lightning
   within the same severe thunderstorm, or even large sets of thunderstorms
   using an objective lightning jump algorithm. Multiple studies have shown
   that the total flash rate rapidly increases prior to the onset of severe
   weather. What is untested within the same framework is the use of CG
   information to perform the same task. Herein, total and CG lightning
   trends for 711 thunderstorms occurring in four regions of the country
   were examined to demonstrate the increased utility that total lightning
   provides over CG lightning, specifically within the framework of
   developing a useful lightning-based severe weather warning decision
   support tool. Results indicate that while both lightning datasets
   demonstrate the presence of increased lightning activity prior to the
   onset of severe weather, the use of total lightning trends was more
   effective than CG trends {[}probability of detection (POD), 79\% versus
   66\%; false alarm rate (FAR), 36\% versus 53\%; critical success index
   (CSI), 55\% versus 38\%; Heidke skill score (HSS), 0.71 versus 0.55].
   Moreover, 40\% of false alarms associated with total lightning, and 16\%
   of false alarms with CG lightning trends, occurred when a lightning jump
   associated with a severe weather ``warning{''} was already in effect. If
   these false alarms are removed, the FAR drops from 36\% to 22\% for
   total lightning and from 53\% to 44\% for CG lightning. Importantly,
   average lead times prior to severe weather occurrence were higher using
   total lightning as compared with CG lightning (20.65 versus 13.54 min).
   The ultimate goal of this study was to demonstrate the increased utility
   of total lightning information that the Geostationary Lightning Mapper
   (GLM) will provide to operational meteorology in anticipation of severe
   convective weather on a hemispheric scale once Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) is deployed in the next decade.},

Abstract = {Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of
   economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005
   Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the
   region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out
   which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides
   and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental
   factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient
   Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
   These machine learning models are innovative and can assess
   environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional
   scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and
   validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a
   proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well
   as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial
   database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning
   factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI,
   Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve
   (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under
   the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5\%),
   0.893 (89.3\%), and 0.790 (79.0\%), respectively. Based on the three
   machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the
   performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895,
   and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers.
   Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors
   affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility
   maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very
   high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized
   construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and
   infrastructural areas.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variations of suspended solid concentrations from

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Concentrations of suspended solids in lakes can affect the latter's
   primary productivity and reflect changes in sediment deposition.
   Determining the temporal and spatial distribution of suspended solid
   concentrations has important significance in lake water environmental
   management; this is particularly urgent for Poyang Lake, the largest
   freshwater lake in China. In this study, suspended solid concentration
   inversion models for Poyang Lake were created using a semi-empirical
   method with regression analysis between continuously measured suspended
   solid concentration data and multi-band moderate-resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer images for spring, summer, autumn, and winter from
   2009 to 2012. The coefficient of determination (R-2) is from 0.6 to 0.9
   and the average relative error for the accuracy verification was between
   10 and 30\%. The seasonal distributions of suspended solid
   concentrations in Poyang Lake from 2000 to 2013 were then obtained using
   optimal reversal models. The results showed that the seasonal variation
   in suspended solid concentrations had a ``W{''} shape in which high
   spring and autumn and low summer and winter values. The suspended solid
   concentrations increased annually from 2000 to 2013 and were mainly
   distributed in the northern and central portions of the lake, with lower
   values along the shorelines. Further analysis indicated that the large
   difference in water level between the wet and dry seasons is an
   important factor in explaining these seasonal variations. Moreover, the
   suspended solid concentrations were poorly correlated with water
   temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration but more highly correlated
   with the deferred chlorophyll-a concentration.},

Title = {Quantifying, comparing, and contrasting forest change pattern from shale
   gas infrastructure development in the British Columbia's shale gas plays},

Abstract = {Understanding the interconnection between land use processes and land
   change patterns is yet to be fully achieved. Land change researchers
   have posited that the lack of understanding is not due to lack of effort
   but rather the difficulty in the task of seeking understanding,
   theoretically and practically. In this study, to understand forest
   change patterns from shale oil and gas (SOG) land use, we combine
   geospatial approach with metrics from landscape ecology to compare and
   contrast forest change from SOG infrastructure development in the four
   shale gas plays in British Columbia (BC). The study finds that
   cumulatively, between 1975 and 2017, the Cordova, Horn, Liard, and
   Montney shale gas plays have lost 0.30\%, 0.25\%, 0.14\%, and 0.36\% of
   forest cover, respectively, due to the construction of SOG well pads,
   access roads, and pipelines. Also, we find that the shale gas plays with
   the largest quantity of forest cover loss from SOG infrastructure
   construction have the highest amount of forest fragmentation and the
   vice versa. The results, however, suggest that differences in the
   intensity of forest cover change from shale gas land use is likely to
   create different ecologically significant forest fragmentation patterns.
   From a broader perspective, this study demonstrates how different levels
   of human-environment interactions yield different levels of
   anthropogenic land use impacts on the environment. The study provides
   land managers with a context for understanding the land use intensities
   and forest change pattern, which is relevant for sustainable land
   management in the shale gas plays in British Columbia.},

Title = {Spatial pattern and regional types of rural settlements in Xuzhou City,
   Jiangsu Province, China},

Abstract = {This paper principally focuses on the morphological differences, spatial
   pattern and regional types of rural settlements in Xuzhou City of
   Jiangsu Province in China. Using satellite images of Xuzhou City taken
   in 2007 and 2008 and models of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)
   and spatial metrics, the paper conducts a quantitative analysis of the
   morphological pattern of rural settlements, and finds significant
   characteristics. First, rural settlements in Xuzhou City are
   significantly agglomerated in terms of their spatial distribution;
   meanwhile, there is significant variation in the geographical density
   distribution. Second, the scale of rural settlements in Xuzhou City is
   larger than the average in Jiangsu Province, and the histogram of the
   scale data is more even and more like a gamma distribution. There are a
   significant high-value cluster in the scale distribution, and local
   negative correlation between the scale and density distribution of rural
   settlements in Xuzhou City. Third, the morphology of rural settlements
   in Xuzhou City shows relative regularity with good connection and
   integrity, but the spatial variation of the morphology is anisotropic.
   Finally, according to the characteristics of density, scale, and form of
   rural settlements, the rural settlements of Xuzhou City are divided into
   three types: A high-density and point-scattered type, a low-density and
   cluster-like type and a mass-like and sparse type. The research findings
   could be used as the scientific foundation for rural planning and
   community rebuilding, particularly in less-developed areas.},

Abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk
   factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing
   national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this
   study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in
   context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for
   previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate
   attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends
   in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural,
   environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks
   from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met
   World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable
   evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from
   randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household
   surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used
   statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate
   covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure
   across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual
   scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of
   deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed
   trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth,
   population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific
   DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a
   Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation,
   household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and
   smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several
   occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased
   by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in
   2015 accounted for 57.8\% (95\% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and
   41.2\% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to
   global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure
   (211.8 million {[}192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking
   (148.6 million {[}134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma
   glucose (143.1 million {[}125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI
   (120.1 million {[}83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood
   undernutrition (113.3 million {[}103.9 million to 123.4 million]),
   ambient particulate matter (103.1 million {[}90.8 million to 115.1
   million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million {[}74.6 million to 105.7
   million]), household air pollution (85.6 million {[}66.7 million to
   106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million {[}77.2 million to 93.0
   million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million {[}49.3 million to
   127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for
   micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation
   and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY
   rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising
   exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from
   high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and
   drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined
   steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting
   plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks,
   such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most
   attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the
   leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries;
   childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early
   death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed
   to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be
   invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting
   plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to
   rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for
   intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain
   major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining.
   Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are
   increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The

Title = {Mapping oak wilt disease from space using land surface phenology},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {298},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Protecting the future of forests relies on our ability to observe
   changes in forest health. Thus, developing tools for sensing diseases in
   a timely fashion is critical for managing threats at broad scales. Oak
   wilt -a disease caused by a pathogenic fungus (Bretziella fagacearum)-
   is threatening oaks, killing thousands yearly while negatively impacting
   the ecosystem services they provide. Here we propose a novel workflow
   for mapping oak wilt by targeting temporal disease progression through
   symptoms using land surface phenology (LSP) from spaceborne
   observations. By doing so, we hypothesize that phenological changes in
   pigments and photosynthetic activity of trees affected by oak wilt can
   be tracked using LSP metrics derived from the Chlorophyll/Carotenoid
   Index (CCI). We used dense time-series observations from Sentinel-2 to
   create Analysis Ready Data across Minnesota and Wisconsin and to derive
   three LSP metrics: the value of CCI at the start and end of the growing
   season, and the coefficient of variation of the CCI during the growing
   season. We integrate high-resolution airborne imagery in multiple
   locations to select pixels (n = 3872) from the most common oak tree
   health conditions: healthy, symptomatic for oak wilt, and dead. These
   pixels were used to train an iterative Partial Least Square Discriminant
   (PLSD) model and derive the probability of an oak tree (i.e., pixel) in
   one of these conditions and the associated uncertainty. We assessed
   these models spatially and temporally on testing datasets revealing that
   it is feasible to discriminate among the three health conditions with
   overall accuracy between 80 and 82\%. Within conditions, our models
   suggest that spatial variations among three CCI-derived LSP metrics can
   identify healthy (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.98), symptomatic (AUC =
   0.89), and dead (AUC = 0.94) oak trees with low false positive rates.
   The model performance was robust across different years as well. The
   predictive maps were used to guide local stakeholders to locate disease
   hotspots for ground verification and subsequent decision-making for
   treat-ment. Our results highlight the capabilities of LSP metrics from
   dense spaceborne observations to map diseases and to monitor large-scale
   change in biodiversity.},

Title = {A Contour-Directional Detection for Deriving Terrace Ridge From Open
   Source Images and Digital Elevation Models},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {129215-129224},
Abstract = {Agricultural terraces, as typically artificial landforms, have
   maintained an important role throughout human history. Terrace ridges,
   which form the main constructive part of terraces, face the greatest
   risk from gully or gravity erosion. Mapping terrace ridges can benefit
   agricultural production management and soil-and-water conservation. This
   study presents a contour-directional detection method that automatically
   maps terrace ridges by considering the image features and topographic
   features of terraces. First, the terrace areas were extracted via
   object-based image analysis. Second, the Canny edge detector was
   employed to extract all edges from the image, and a digital elevation
   model (DEM) was used to generate the contour direction. The contour
   direction and edge image were then overlaid to implement the
   contour-directional detection method, which detects ridges along the
   contour direction. Finally, those candidate terrace ridges which lengths
   exceed an appropriate threshold were identified as terrace ridges. Five
   study areas located in the Loess Plateau of China were used to validate
   the proposed method. The results showed that the correctness,
   completeness, and quality ranged from 82.57\% to 94.92\%, from 82.51\%
   to 88.39\%, and from 70.28\% to 84.40\%, respectively. However, the
   proposed method is widely available and can be easily applied by using
   open global images and DEMs, such as Google Earth images and ASTER GDEM.},

Title = {The Changes in Dominant Driving Factors in the Evolution Process of
   Wetland in the Yellow River Delta during 2015-2022},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Most of the previous studies exploring the changing patterns of wetland
   in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) were conducted based on sparse
   time-series images, which ignored its severe environmental gradient and
   rapid evolution process of the wetland. The changes in the dominant
   factors in the evolution of the wetland in the YRD are not clear. This
   study used the dense time-series Sentinel-2 images to establish a
   wetland database of the YRD, and then analyzed the spatial distribution
   characteristics of, and temporal changes in, the wetland during
   2015-2022. Finally, the dominant factors of the spatio-temporal
   evolutions of the wetland were explored and revealed. The results showed
   the following. (1) During 2015-2022, the wetland in the YRD was
   dominated by artificial wetland, accounting for 54.02\% of the total
   wetland area in the study area. In 2015-2022, the total wetland area
   increased by 309.90 km(2), including an increase of 222.63 km(2) in
   natural wetlands and 87.27 km(2) in artificial wetlands. In the
   conversion between wetland types, 218.73 km(2) of artificial wetlands
   were converted into natural wetlands, and 75.18 km(2) of natural
   wetlands were converted into artificial wetlands. The patch density of
   rivers, swamps, and salt pans increased, showing a trend of
   fragmentation. However, the overall degree of landscape fragmentation in
   wetlands weakened. The trend of changes in the number of patches and
   landscape shape index was the same, while the trend of changes in
   Shannon's diversity index and Contagion index was completely opposite.
   (2) Natural factors, such as precipitation (0.51, 2015; 0.65, 2016), DEM
   (0.57, 2017; 0.47, 2018; 0.49, 2020; 0.46, 2021), vegetation coverage
   (0.59, 2019), and temperature (0.48, 2022), were the dominant
   influencing factors of wetland changes in the YRD. The dominant single
   factor causing the changes in artificial wetlands was vegetation
   coverage, while socio-economic factors had lower explanatory power, with
   the average q value of 0.18. (3) During 2015-2022, the interactions
   between the natural and artificial factors of the wetland changes were
   mostly nonlinear and showed double-factor enhancement. The interactions
   between temperature and sunshine hours had the largest explanatory power
   for natural wetland change, while interactions between precipitation and
   vegetation coverage, and between temperature and vegetation coverage,
   had large contribution rates for artificial wetland change. The
   interactions among natural factors had the greatest impacts on wetland
   change, followed by interactions between natural factors and
   socio-economic factors, while interactions among socio-economic factors
   had more slight impacts on wetland change. The results can provide a
   scientific basis for regional wetland protection and management.},

Abstract = {Building a network of interconnected overmature forests is crucial for
   the conservation of biodiversity. Indeed, a multitude of plant and
   animal species depend on forest structural maturity attributes such as
   very large living trees and deadwood. LiDAR technology has proved to be
   powerful when assessing forest structural parameters, and it may be a
   promising way to identify existing overmature forest patches over large
   areas. We first built an index (IMAT) combining several forest
   structural maturity attributes in order to characterize the structural
   maturity of 660 field plots in the French northern Pre-Alps. We then
   selected or developed LiDAR metrics and applied them in a random forest
   model designed to predict the IMAT. Model performance was evaluated with
   the root mean square error of prediction obtained from a bootstrap
   cross-validation and a Spearman correlation coefficient calculated
   between observed and predicted IMAT. Predictors were ranked by
   importance based on the average increase in the squared out-of-bag error
   when the variable was randomly permuted. Despite a non-negligible RMSEP
   (0.85 for calibration and validation data combined and 1.26 for
   validation data alone), we obtained a high correlation (0.89) between
   the observed and predicted IMAT values, indicating an accurate ranking
   of the field plots. LiDAR metrics for height (maximum height and height
   heterogeneity) were among the most important metrics for predicting
   forest maturity, together with elevation, slope and, to a lesser extent,
   with metrics describing the distribution of echoes' intensities. Our
   framework makes it possible to reconstruct a forest maturity gradient
   and isolate maturity hot spots. Nevertheless, our approach could be
   considerably strengthened by taking into consideration site fertility,
   collecting other maturity attributes in the field or developing adapted
   LiDAR metrics. Including additional spectral or textural metrics from
   optical imagery might also improve the predictive capacity of the model.},

   intensity, duration and frequency of precipitation can aggravate the
   erosive process. The objective of the study was to determine the spatial
   and temporal distribution of rainfall erosivity in the Amazon. Data were
   collected from 334 rainfall gauge stations distributed throughout the
   region, composing a series of 20 years (1997-2016). The gaps in this
   series were filled with satellite data using the CPC MORPHing technique.
   The erosivity equations used were those available in the literature and
   based on the modified Fournier index. The values of precipitation and
   erosivity were interpolated using GIS software, and thematic maps were
   generated for these variables. The annual value of rainfall erosivity
   ranged from 7060 to 36767 (Mj mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1)). On the monthly
   scale, the highest rates of erosivity were recorded in the rainy season,
   i.e., February and March, at approximately 1548 and 2651 (Mj mm ha(-1)
   h(-1) month(-1)), respectively. In the context of erosion risk, the
   region was classified as having very strong erosivity. Therefore, it is
   imperative that land management and conservation policies be implemented
   to minimize erosion in the region, which, at its borders, undergoes
   intense land use change, i.e., forests are being transformed into
   pastures and grain crops.},

Abstract = {Background: We present data on Pap test results and HPV prevalence from
   the HPV Sentinel Surveillance project, a multiyear surveillance project
   enrolling women from a diverse set of 26 clinics throughout the US from
   2003 to 2005. We use mathematical modeling to illustrate the potential
   timing and magnitude of decreases in Pap test abnormalities in sexually
   transmitted disease (STD), family planning, and primary care clinics in
   the US as a result of HPV vaccination.
   Methods: The probability of an abnormal Pap result was based on three
   factors: (1) infection with HPV 16/18, or both; (2) infection with
   high-risk HPV types other than HPV 16/18; and (3) infection with HPV
   6/11, or both. We estimated the relative reduction in the probability of
   an abnormal Pap result over the first 25 years of a female-only,
   quadrivalent HPV vaccination program, compared to a scenario of no HPV
   vaccination in which the probability of abnormal Pap results was assumed
   constant.
   Results: The probability of an abnormal Pap result ranged from 7.0\% for
   the lowest risk group (those without any high-risk HPV types and without
   HPV 6/11) to 45.2\% for the highest risk group (those with HPV 16/18 and
   at least one other high-risk HPV type). Estimated reductions in abnormal
   Pap results among women in the 21- to 29-year age group were 0.8\%,
   10.2\%, and 11.3\% in years 5, 15, and 25 of the vaccine program
   respectively, in the lower vaccine coverage scenario, and 7.4\%, 21.4\%,
   and 22.2\%, respectively, in the higher coverage scenario.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that HPV vaccination will have a
   discernable impact on the probability of Pap abnormalities, but the
   timing and magnitude of the reduction will depend substantially on
   vaccine coverage and the degree of cross-protection against high risk
   HPV types other than HPV 16/18. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Loktak is the largest natural wetland of Northeast India, the last home
   of endangered brow-antlered deer, and a site of global significance
   recognized under Ramsar convention. Ecological and human-meditated
   spatial patterns of Loktak wetland were characterized and classified
   using a Radarsat-2 C band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data.
   Radarsat-2 quad-pol scene of dry season was preprocessed and classified
   using PolSARpro software. Eigen vector-eigen value decomposition of
   coherency matrix (T3) was performed to characterize the scattering
   properties of wetland targets based on entropy (H)/anisotropy (A)/alpha
   angle (alpha) segmentation. Results illustrate that RGB color display of
   H/A/a images is a useful indicator of wetland structure and composition,
   and provide clear visual discrimination of open water, floating phumdi,
   permanent phumdi cover, and associated man-made features. Six classes,
   namely, floating phumdi, permanent phumdi, scrub/shrub, fallow land,
   built-up, and open water were mapped using Wishart classification of
   H/A/a images. Scattering mechanisms of natural and man-made targets
   synthesized from PolSAR data, and their classification using Wishart
   algorithm have been validated through a visually classified map and
   field reference points. The land cover generated would be useful for
   conservation and management of Loktak wetland and brow-antlered deer
   population. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Title = {Rapid Mapping and Annual Dynamic Evaluation of Quality of Urban Green
   Spaces on Google Earth Engine},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In order to achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) related to green spaces, monitoring dynamic urban green
   spaces (UGSs) in cities around the world is crucial. Continuous dynamic
   UGS mapping is challenged by large computation, time consumption, and
   energy consumption requirements. Therefore, a fast and automated
   workflow is needed to produce a high-precision UGS map. In this study,
   we proposed an automatic workflow to produce up-to-date UGS maps using
   Otsu's algorithm, a Random Forest (RF) classifier, and the migrating
   training samples method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We
   took the central urban area of Beijing, China, as the study area to
   validate this method, and we rapidly obtained an annual UGS map of the
   central urban area of Beijing from 2016 to 2020. The accuracy assessment
   results showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) and kappa
   coefficient (KC) were 96.47\% and 94.25\%, respectively. Additionally,
   we used six indicators to measure quality and temporal changes in the
   UGS spatial distribution between 2016 and 2020. In particular, we
   evaluated the quality of UGS using the urban greenness index (UGI) and
   Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) at the pixel level. The experimental
   results indicate the following: (1) The UGSs in the center of Beijing
   increased by 48.62 km(2) from 2016 to 2020, and the increase was mainly
   focused in Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Shijingshan Districts. (2) The average
   proportion of relatively high and above levels (UGI > 0.5) in six
   districts increased by 2.71\% in the study area from 2016 to 2020, and
   this proportion peaked at 36.04\% in 2018. However, our result revealed
   that the increase was non-linear during this assessment period. (3)
   Although there was no significant increase or decrease in SHDI values in
   the study area, the distribution of the SHDI displayed a noticeable
   fluctuation in the northwest, southwest, and northeast regions of the
   study area between 2016 and 2020. Furthermore, we discussed and analyzed
   the influence of population on the spatial distribution of UGSs. We
   found that three of the five cold spots were located in the east and
   southeast of Haidian District. Therefore, the proposed workflow could
   provide rapid mapping and dynamic evaluation of the quality of UGS.</p>},

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of land use/land cover change on groundwater
   depletion in Northwestern China - A case study of the Dunhuang oasis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {270-279},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the Dunhuang oasis in the arid Northwest China has
   been undergoing significant changes due to social-economic development
   and expanded irrigation for agricultural production. Groundwater table
   was found to have significantly declined during the period of 1987-2007
   owing to greater pumping. We analyzed the impacts of land use/land cover
   (LU/LC) changes on the groundwater fluctuations in the study area. The
   LU/LC types were derived from the satellite images for the years of
   1987, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007. The water consumptions associated with
   the LU/LC types were estimated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method.
   Results show that during the period of 1987-2007, the area of
   agricultural land sharply increased by 98.7 km(2), and the cash crops
   were the main contributor. Under the current market system, farmers had
   much more autonomy and greater incentives to shift the cropping pattern
   from the traditional food crops to the high value cash crops with
   greater water consumption. The total water consumption of the cash crops
   accounted for 14.1\% of the total water consumption in 1987, but
   increased to 71.6\% in 2007, becoming the largest water consumer. The
   agricultural land use was the main cause of the declining groundwater
   table during the period from 1987 to 2007. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Effect of stroke early supported discharge on length of hospital stay:
   analysis from a national stroke registry},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Objective The first observational study to investigate the impact of
   early supported discharge (ESD) on length of hospital stay in real-world
   conditions.
   Design Using historical prospective Sentinel Stroke National Audit
   Programme (SSNAP) data (1 January 2013-31 December 2016) and multilevel
   modelling, cross-sectional (2015-2016; 30 791 patients nested within 55
   hospitals) and repeated cross-sectional (2013-2014 vs 2015-2016; 49 266
   patients nested within 41 hospitals) analyses were undertaken.
   Setting Hospitals were sampled across a large geographical area of
   England covering the West and East Midlands, the East of England and the
   North of England.
   Participants Stroke patients whose data were entered into the SSNAP
   database by hospital teams.
   Interventions Receiving ESD along the patient care pathway.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Length of hospital stay.
   Results When adjusted for important case-mix variables, patients who
   received ESD on their stroke care pathway spent longer in hospital,
   compared with those who did not receive ESD. The percentage increase was
   15.8\% (95\% CI 12.3\% to 19.4\%) for the 2015-2016 cross-sectional
   analysis and 18.8\% (95\% CI 13.9\% to 24.0\%) for the 2013-2014 versus
   2015-2016 repeated cross-sectional analysis. On average, the increased
   length of hospital stay was approximately 1 day.
   Conclusions This study has shown that by comparing ESD and non-ESD
   patient groups matched for important patient characteristics, receiving
   ESD resulted in a 1-day increase in length of hospital stay. The large
   reduction in length of hospital stay overall, since original trials were
   conducted, may explain why a reduction was not observed. The longer term
   benefits of accessing ESD need to be investigated further.},

Title = {Mapping Oyster Reef Distribution Using Kompsat-2/3 and Linear Spectral
   Unmixing Algorithm - A Case Study at Hwangdo Tidal Flat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {102},
Pages = {246-253},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Oyster areas are widely used as species of biological indicator, and
   they are also the most important shellfish in terms of ecosystem
   economic valuation. Oysters are production on the west coast before 2007
   accounted for about 5 \% of the nation's total production, but the 2007
   Hebei Spirit oil spill caused production to plunge to less than 1 \%.
   Therefore, spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs are required to
   help local authorities define management strategies. In this study,
   Kompsat-2/3 was used to map oyster reef distribution and analyze the
   distribution of oyster reefs based on linear spctral unmixing in Hwangdo
   tidal flat. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions
   with a field spectroradiometer, was used to conduct linear spectral
   unmixing classifications on Kompsat-2/3 data. The classification result
   shows very high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 95 \% or more, and
   there were misclassifications in some areas. The most causes of
   misclassification are the similarity of spectral characteristics and the
   limitations of the spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite images.
   For this reason, it was difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs
   and area distributed with many macrobenthos, and small-young oyster
   reefs were difficult to classify due to very weak reflectivity. In
   addition, the sand bar, it was is difficult to distinguish between
   oyster reefs related to dead reefs and sandbars because of the high
   reflectivity of these areas in the imagery. As a result of analyzing the
   change in the oyster reef area, it increased in 2019 compared to that in
   2015. Especially, the oyster reef area increased in 30-50 \% sand
   content and decreased in 20-30 \% and 60-70 \%. The changes of sand
   sediment seem to affect the distribution of oyster reefs. This study may
   be useful for mapping the distribution of oyster reefs and understanding
   the spatial variation of their habitat.},

Abstract = {More than half of the world's population consumes rice. Recently, the
   area sown with modern rice varieties has expanded, and the use of
   chemical fertilizers and pesticides has increased in various countries.
   Wetland hydrology is also influenced by chemical and physical
   characteristics. Hence, this research focused on temporal and spatial
   changes in crop patterns, input usage, and hydrology in the Ethiopian
   Fogera floodplain, with the following objectives: (a) What are the
   spatial and temporal trends in crop production patterns? (b) What input
   changes have occurred to produce rice and other crops? (c) What
   hydrological changes have occurred in the area with intensification of
   production systems? Primary data were gathered through a questionnaire,
   focus group discussions, interviews, and field observations. Secondary
   data were obtained from Landsat imageries, the SWAT model, water flow
   measurements, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI
   results indicated that the area cultivated for rice is increasing while
   the area of other crops is decreasing. Agricultural inputs are used in
   rice systems but were not used before the introduction of rice.
   Recession farming activities have also diminished wetland areas. Water
   flow showed a decrease, whereas Nitrogen and Phosphorus showed an
   increase with Pearson's correlation values -0.069 and -0.072,
   respectively. Flow of water was negatively correlated with N and P water
   concentration, whereas N and P contents were positively correlated. In
   conclusion, growth of intensive rice systems has had negative
   environmental consequences on wetland ecology. Therefore, policies to
   regulate and manage wetland uses are recommended.},

Title = {Assessing bank dynamics of the Lower Meghna River in Bangladesh: an
   integrated GIS-DSAS approach},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The major conduit of water and sediment discharges from the mighty
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system to the Bay of Bengal, the Lower
   Meghna River (LMR), experiences rapid morphological changes with
   significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences to the
   surrounding areas. This study measures the rate of bankline shifting,
   river widening, and change in the braiding index (BI) in the LMR over a
   period of 30 years (1988-2017) in order to understand the channel
   dynamics. To extract these parameters, we used the Digital Shoreline
   Analysis System (DSAS) together with other geospatial techniques on
   multiple satellite images taken over this period and subsequently
   validated the spatial outcomes through an extensive field investigation.
   Our findings revealed that rapid changes occurred in both banks,
   although at different rates, mostly due to erosion; the right bank has
   retreated at an average rate of 81 m/yr and the left bank at 28 m/yr,
   resulting in widening as well as river migration to the west. The
   channel widening, an overall average increase of about 49\%, has been
   accompanied by a substantial increase in the BI, from 2.2 in 1988 to 6.4
   in 2017. This study suggests that the higher erosion rate in the right
   bank and the consequent westward migration of the river are due to the
   active tectonic setting of the adjoining areas. Enormous volumes of
   water and sediment discharges and their periodic variations,
   heterogeneous bank material properties, climate change, and
   anthropogenic activities are also possible contributors to this bank
   instability. This research shows the value of implementing an integrated
   GIS-DSAS tool for spatiotemporal channel change investigation and could
   be useful in land-use planning and mitigating bank erosion in the LMR
   locality.},

Abstract = {The accelerated sea level rise and its resulting impacts on the highly
   populated coastal regions bearing significant economic value is one of
   the negative outcomes of climate change. In this study, the most
   vulnerable areas regarding sea level rise in Turkey are defined through
   CVI analysis, and the level of inundation is estimated from
   multi-mission satellite altimetry sea level anomaly, together with
   significant wave heights and the effects of tidal and meteorological
   forcing. Consequently, the maximum level of flooding that is expected to
   occur by 2100 reaches up to 6.7 m in Cukurova Delta which is one of the
   most vulnerable areas of the country, and GIS-based inundation mapping
   on the high resolution elevation model indicates that 69\% of the area
   would be under the risk of flooding. Considering the probable sea level
   rise in Cukurova by the end of this century, immediate adaptive measures
   must be undertaken for the protection of the coastal zone. In addition,
   it will be of utmost importance to make an inventory of the vulnerable
   zones comprising coastal aquifers and ecosystems, and to introduce
   adaptive long-term strategies related to local coastal zone management
   plans.},

Title = {Interprofessional simulation to improve safety in the epilepsy

Journal = {EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {229-233},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective: Patient safety is critical for epilepsy monitoring units
   (EMUs). Effective training is important for educating all personnel,
   including residents and nurses who frequently cover these units. We
   performed a needs assessment and developed a simulation-based team
   training curriculum employing actual EMU sentinel events to train
   neurology resident-nurse interprofessional teams to maximize effective
   responses to high-acuity events.
   Methods: A mixed-methods design was used. This included the development
   of a safe-practice checklist to assess team response to acute events in
   the EMU using expert review with consensus (a modified Delphi process).
   All nineteen incoming first-year neurology residents and 2 nurses
   completed a questionnaire assessing baseline knowledge and attitudes
   regarding seizure management prior to and following a team training
   program employing simulation and postscenario debriefing. Four
   resident-nurse teams were recorded while participating in two simulated
   scenarios. Employing retrospective video review, four trained raters
   used the newly developed safe-practice checklist to assess team
   performance. We calculated the interobserver reliability of the
   checklist for consistency among the raters. We attempted to ascertain
   whether the training led to improvement in performance in the actual EMU
   by comparing 10 videos of resident-nurse team responses to seizures 4-8
   months into the academic year preceding the curricular training to 10
   that included those who received the training within 4-8months of the
   captured video.
   Results: Knowledge in seizure management was significantly improved
   following the program, but confidence in seizure management was not.
   Interrater agreement was moderate to high for consistency of raters for
   the majority of individual checklist items. We were unable to
   demonstrate that the training led to sustainable improvement in
   performance in the actual EMU by the method we used.
   Conclusions: A simulated team training curriculum using a safe-practice
   checklist to improve the management of acute events in an EMU may be an
   effective method of training neurology residents. However, translating
   the results into sustainable benefits and confidence in management in
   the EMU requires further study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A research team from Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical
   School conducted a community-based feeding study in collaboration with
   Framingham State University (FSU) and Sodexo, the food service
   contractor at FSU. The study was a randomized controlled trial,
   implemented on the FSU campus. For the final year of the study, a
   satellite feeding site was established at Assabet Valley Regional
   Technical High School. The purpose of the study was to assess the
   biological effects of different macronutrient diets. An
   academia-industry partnership was developed to overcome common
   challenges associated with hospital-based feeding studies. Benefits
   included the following: a study site outside of Boston (reducing
   inconvenience for participants), access to a large commercial kitchen
   and study-specific kiosk (promoting efficiency), collaboration with
   Sodexo chefs (ensuring palatability of meals), and opportunity to
   procure food from contracted vendors. The research (academia) and food
   service (industry) teams worked together to design, plan, and execute
   intervention protocols using an integrated approach. During execution,
   the research team was primarily responsible for overseeing treatment
   fidelity, whereas the food service team provided culinary expertise,
   with a strong focus on hospitality and food quality. The study was
   conducted in 3 cohorts between August 2014 and May 2017. Participants
   received all of their food for similar to 30 wk, totaling >160,000
   meals. For all 3 cohorts combined, 234 participants provided informed
   consent, 229 started a standard run-in weight-loss diet, 164 lost a mean
   +/- SD 12\% +/- 2\% of baseline body weight and were randomly assigned
   to different macronutrient diets for weight-loss maintenance, and 148
   completed the study. During the final and largest cohort, as many as 114
   participants received daily meals concurrently. The daily cost per
   participant for preparation and service of weighed meals and snacks was
   similar to\$65. This academia-industry partnership provides a model for
   controlled feeding protocols in nutrition research, potentially with
   enhanced cost-effectiveness, practicality, and generalizability.},

Title = {Twilight-free geolocation from noisy light data},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1190-1198},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {1. Solar geolocation is used to quantify the movements of animals tagged
   with sensors that record ambient light with respect to time. Global
   location sensor (GLS) tags are small, light, and present minimal drag or
   wing loading. They are affordable, and some can record data for several
   migratory cycles. These benefits mean they can be used in applications
   for which satellite tags are unsuitable. However, large errors in
   estimated locations can result if the sensor is obscured, especially
   around twilight, and sometimes the data obtained is unusable by existing
   methods of analysis due to this source of noise. This places limitations
   on the usefulness of solar geolocation in conservation and monitoring
   efforts.
   2. All existing methods of analysis are dependent on twilights being
   identifiable or faithfully recorded. Instead, the method introduced here
   depends on the overall pattern of day and night to calculate the
   likelihoods for a Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are
   geographic locations. We call this a ``twilight-free{''} method of
   light-based geolocation.
   3. This method quickly estimates locations from otherwise unusable noisy
   light data. We use examples to show that the method produces tracks that
   are comparable in accuracy and precision to other geolocation methods.
   Furthermore, efficiency and replicability of estimated paths are
   improved because the user does not have to subjectively identify
   twilights. Other data sources, such as sea surface temperature and land
   or sea masks are easily incorporated, further improving location
   estimates and processing speed.
   4. The twilight-free method offers new opportunities to researchers
   interested in the movements of animals that routinely have obscured
   sensors, or to analyse previously unusable noisy light data. It offers a
   fast, efficient, and replicable method for analysing tag data without
   the need for time-consuming pre- or post-processing. By increasing the
   yield of usable data from GLS tagging studies, researchers can more
   efficiently quantify where animals are going and when, and monitor
   changes in habitat. This is of fundamental importance to management and
   conservation efforts.},

Title = {An Empirical Evaluation of Landscape Energetic Models: Mallard and

Abstract = {Bird conservation Joint Ventures are collaborative partnerships between
   public agencies and private organizations that facilitate habitat
   management to support waterfowl and other bird populations. A subset of
   Joint Ventures has developed energetic carrying capacity models (ECCs)
   to translate regional waterfowl population goals into habitat objectives
   during the non-breeding period. Energetic carrying capacity models
   consider food biomass, metabolism, and available habitat to estimate
   waterfowl carrying capacity within an area. To evaluate Joint Venture
   ECCs in the context of waterfowl space use, we monitored 33 female
   mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 55 female American black ducks (A.
   rubripes) using global positioning system satellite telemetry in the
   central and eastern United States. To quantify space use, we measured
   first-passage time (FPT: time required for an individual to transit
   across a circle of a given radius) at biologically relevant spatial
   scales for mallards (3.46 km) and American black ducks (2.30 km) during
   the non-breeding period, which included autumn migration, winter, and
   spring migration. We developed a series of models to predict FPT using
   Joint Venture ECCs and compared them to a biological null model that
   quantified habitat composition and a statistical null model, which
   included intercept and random terms. Energetic carrying capacity models
   predicted mallard space use more efficiently during autumn and spring
   migrations, but the statistical null was the top model for winter. For
   American black ducks, ECCs did not improve predictions of space use; the
   biological null was top ranked for winter and the statistical null was
   top ranked for spring migration. Thus, ECCs provided limited insight
   into predicting waterfowl space use during the non-breeding season.
   Refined estimates of spatial and temporal variation in food abundance,
   habitat conditions, and anthropogenic disturbance will likely improve
   ECCs and benefit conservation planners in linking non-breeding waterfowl
   habitat objectives with distribution and population parameters.

Title = {Epibionts Reflect Spatial and Foraging Ecology of Gulf of Mexico
   Loggerhead Turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Sea turtles are exposed to numerous threats during migrations to their
   foraging grounds and at those locations. Therefore, information on sea
   turtle foraging and spatial ecology can guide conservation initiatives,
   yet it is difficult to directly observe migrating or foraging turtles.
   To gain insights into the foraging and spatial ecology of turtles,
   studies have increasingly analyzed epibionts of nesting turtles, as
   epibionts must overlap spatially and ecologically with their hosts to
   colonize successfully. Epibiont analysis may be integrated with stable
   isotope information to identify taxa that can serve as indicators of sea
   turtle foraging and spatial ecology, but few studies have pursued this.
   To determine if epibionts can serve as indicators of foraging and
   spatial ecology of loggerhead turtles nesting in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico we combined turtle stable isotope and taxonomic epibiont
   analysis. We sampled 22 individual turtles and identified over 120,000
   epibiont individuals, belonging to 34 macrofauna taxa (>1 mm) and 22
   meiofauna taxa (63 mu m-1 mm), including 111 nematode genera. We
   quantified epidermis delta C-13 and delta N-15, and used these to assign
   loggerhead turtles to broad foraging regions. The abundance and presence
   of macrofauna and nematodes did not differ between inferred foraging
   regions, but the presence of select meiofauna taxa differentiated
   between three inferred foraging regions. Further, dissimilarities in
   macrofauna, meiofauna, and nematode assemblages corresponded to
   dissimilarities in individual stable isotope values within inferred
   foraging regions. This suggests that certain epibiont taxa may be
   indicative of foraging regions used by loggerhead turtles in the Gulf of
   Mexico, and of individual turtle foraging and habitat use specialization
   within foraging regions. Continued sampling of epibionts at nesting
   beaches and foraging grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and globally, coupled
   with satellite telemetry and/or dietary studies, can expand upon our
   findings to develop epibionts as efficient indicators of sea turtle
   foraging and spatial ecology.},

Abstract = {The 2022 revision of the Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS) Clinical
   Practice Guidelines for surgical treatment of breast cancer was updated
   following a systematic review of the literature using the Medical
   Information Network Distribution Service (MINDS) procedure, which
   focuses on the balance of benefits and harms for various clinical
   questions (CQs). Experts in surgery designated by the JBCS addressed
   five areas: breast surgery, axillary surgery, breast reconstruction,
   surgical treatment for recurrent and metastatic breast cancer, and other
   related topics. The revision of the guidelines encompassed 4 CQs, 7
   background questions (BQs), and 14 future research questions (FRQs). A
   significant revision in the 2022 edition pertained to axillary
   management after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in CQ2. The primary aim of the
   2022 JBCS Clinical Practice Guidelines is to provide evidence-based
   recommendations to empower patients and healthcare professionals in
   making informed decisions regarding surgical treatment for breast
   cancer.},

Abstract = {Background Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
   (rtPA) improves outcome for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS),
   but many of them still have substantial disability. Glibenclamide (US
   adopted name, glyburide), a long-acting sulfonylurea, shows promising
   result in treating AIS from both preclinical and clinical studies. This
   study investigates the safety and efficacy of glibenclamide combined
   with rtPA in treating AIS patients. Methods This is a prospective,
   randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with an
   estimated sample size of 306 cases, starting in January 2018. Patients
   aged 18 to 74 years, presented with a symptomatic anterior circulation
   occlusion with a deficit on the NIHSS of 4 to 25 points and treated with
   intravenous rtPA within the first 4.5 h of their clinical onsets, are
   eligible for participation in this study. The target time from the onset
   of symptoms to receive the study drug is of 10 h. Subjects are
   randomized 1: 1 to receive glibenclamide or placebo with a loading dose
   of 1.25 mg, followed by 0.625 mg every 8 h for total 5 days. The primary
   efficacy endpoint is 90-day good outcome, measured as modified Rankin
   Scale of 0 to 2. Safety outcomes are all-cause 30-day mortality and
   early neurological deterioration, with a focus on cardiac- and

Title = {Occurrence of basking shark <i>Cetorhinus maximus</i> in southern
   Portuguese waters: a two-decade survey},

Abstract = {There is a general consensus that many shark species are declining in
   numbers. However, effective management measures often depend on knowing
   how trends in abundance and distribution are influenced by environmental
   conditions. Several efforts to describe the occurrence and distribution
   of basking sharks Cetorhinus maximus have been made in northern Europe,
   particularly around the UK, but nothing is known regarding their
   occurrence in southern areas, such as the south of Portugal. Using 2
   decades of observational data collected in the south of Portugal, we
   show that the occurrence of basking sharks in the area was highly
   seasonal, with individuals being observed mainly during spring. Based on
   in situ and satellite-derived environmental variables and climate
   indices, we also demonstrate that temporal trends were associated with
   the beginning of the upwelling season and that the inter-annual changes
   were related to lower values of sea surface temperature, North Atlantic
   Oscillation index, upwelling index, 2-mo lagged chlorophyll a and 3-mo
   lagged Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index, and higher values of
   2-mo lagged upwelling index. These findings suggest that basking sharks
   are associated with the expansion of cold waters following upwelling
   events in the region, probably due to the aggregation and increase of
   zooplankton. Although the temperature recorded during our study years
   ranged from 14 to 24 degrees C, sharks were mainly observed when
   temperatures were lower than 20 degrees C, corroborating their
   preference for colder water. This study provides the first knowledge on
   the habitat use of basking sharks in southern European Atlantic areas.},

Title = {Medication performance measures and mortality following acute coronary

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {118},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: To identify patient and health care factors which are related
   to the use of medical treatments that comprise quality measures and to
   assess the relation of these measures with mortality.
   Methods: The study sample consisted of 20 140 patients with acute
   coronary syndromes from the international GRACE registry. Multivariable
   logistic regression modeling was used to determine predictors of quality
   performance. Quality indicators were use of aspirin and beta-blockers
   within 24 hours and at hospital discharge, use of angiotensin-converting
   enzyme (ACE) inhibitors at discharge, and in-hospital mortality.
   Results: Use of medications in eligible patients at discharge ranged
   from 73\% for ACE inhibitors to 93\% for aspirin. High-risk features
   (eg, heart failure, older age) were related to failure to use aspirin
   and beta-blockers. Being at a teaching hospital and care by a
   cardiologist were associated with better use of aspirin and
   beta-blockers. Coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with
   failure to use ACE inhibitors and aspirin. When hospitals were divided
   into quartiles of quality performance, adjusted in-hospital mortality
   was 4.1\% in the top versus 5.6\% in the bottom quartile, representing a
   27\% (95\% confidence interval: 11\% to 42\%) lower relative mortality.
   Conclusion: Identification of factors associated with failure to use
   proven treatments, including high-risk groups that would derive
   particular benefit from effective therapies, provides an opportunity to
   focus quality improvement interventions. The association of lower
   hospital mortality with better use of selected medical treatments
   supports their measurement to improve quality of care. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Title = {Evaluation of Six Algorithms to Monitor Wheat Leaf Nitrogen
   Concentration},

Abstract = {The rapid and non-destructive monitoring of the canopy leaf nitrogen
   concentration (LNC) in crops is important for precise nitrogen (N)
   management. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to identify
   next-generation bio-physical variable retrieval algorithms that can be
   incorporated into an operational processing chain for hyperspectral
   satellite missions. We assessed six retrieval algorithms for estimating
   LNC from canopy reflectance of winter wheat in eight field experiments.
   These experiments represented variations in the N application rates,
   planting densities, ecological sites and cultivars and yielded a total
   of 821 samples from various places in Jiangsu, China over nine
   consecutive years. Based on the reflectance spectra and their first
   derivatives, six methods using different numbers of wavelengths were
   applied to construct predictive models for estimating wheat LNC,
   including continuum removal (CR), vegetation indices (VIs), stepwise
   multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression
   (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines
   (SVMs). To assess the performance of these six methods, we provided a
   systematic evaluation of the estimation accuracies using the six metrics
   that were the coefficients of determination for the calibration (R-C(2))
   and validation (R-V(2)) sets, the root mean square errors of prediction
   (RMSEP) for the calibration and validation sets, the ratio of prediction
   to deviation (RPD), the computational efficiency (CE) and the complexity
   level (CL). The following results were obtained: (1) For the VIs method,
   SAVI(R-1200, R-705) produced a more accurate estimation of the LNC than
   other indices, with R-C(2), R-V(2), RMSEP, RPD and CE values of 0.844,
   0.795, 0.384, 2.005 and 0.10 min, respectively; (2) For the SMLR, PLSR,
   ANNs and SVMs methods, the SVMs using the first derivative canopy
   spectra (SVM-FDS) offered the best accuracy in terms of R-C(2), R-V(2),
   RMSEP, RPD, and CE, at 0.96, 0.78, 0.37, 2.02, and 21.17, respectively;
   (3) The PLSR-FDS, ANN-OS and SVM-FDS methods yield similar accuracies if
   the CE and CL are not considered, however, ANNs and SVMs performed
   better on calibration set than the validation set which indicate that we
   should take more caution with the two methods for over-fitting. Except
   PLS method, the performance for most methods did not enhance when the
   spectrum were operated by the first derivative. Moreover, the evaluation
   of the robustness demonstrates that SVM method may be better suited than
   the other methods to cope with potential confounding factors for most
   varieties, ecological site and growth stage; (4) The prediction accuracy
   was found to be higher when more wavelengths were used, though at the
   cost of a lower CE. The findings are of interest to the remote sensing
   community for the development of improved inversion schemes for
   hyperspectral applications concerning other types of vegetation. The
   examples provided in this paper may also serve to illustrate the
   advantages and shortcomings of empirical hyperspectral models for
   mapping important vegetation biophysical properties of other crops.},

Title = {Incremental Production of Urban Public Green Space: A `Spiral Space'
   Building Typology},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper addresses a challenging global problem, insufficient
   accessible urban public green space, based on building typology.
   Offering sufficient public green spaces and maintaining the equalities
   of citizens' accessibility in high-intensity urban cities has been
   increasingly challenging. Thus, providing adequate and accessible green
   public spaces by 2030 is a sub-goal of SDGs No. 11. Solving this urban
   problem is commonly considered the responsibility of urban planning;
   however, the potential of buildings is scarcely discussed in academia.
   Luckily, in the industry, many top architecture firms (studios) have
   tapped the particular potential of buildings via design practice. This
   practice-led research aims to understand the efforts made by industrial
   circles. Based on the fieldwork worldwide, this study proposes a `spiral
   space' building typology to work as a conceptual framework for this
   emerging field. The key benefit of this building typology-incremental
   production of public green spaces-is qualitatively verified, and the
   good flexibility and international acceptance of this building typology
   are demonstrated based on global cases. This work could serve as a basis
   for future research on how buildings could play a greater role in
   supporting urban sustainability, such as enhancing the residents'
   accessibility to public green space in metropolises. In addition, the
   building typology and corresponding design strategies discussed herein
   could also serve as references for future design practice for
   architects.},

Abstract = {Countries have been developing renewable energies for quite some time
   now, and people are starting to think of them as being affordable,
   readily available, and good for the environment. The time has come to
   develop wave energy. Governments around the world are finally seeing the
   benefits of its unstoppable grace and power and are starting to account
   for it in their renewable energy portfolios. There is one huge potential
   problem, however, and that is ``public acceptability{''}. Even though
   public acceptability is not a new phenomenon - it has often been
   encountered with new technologies and even new things there is one
   unique factor this time. It is the common space hugging the continents
   called the ocean.
   The traditional ocean uses, especially within three miles of the
   coastline in the U.S., do not include energy extraction. The question
   becomes how this new need for harnessing ocean power and turning it into
   electricity is going to fit within the existing array of ocean uses
   fishing, recreation, transportation, aesthetics, and marine life
   conservation. The state of Oregon, U.S.A., has been identified as the
   most suitable place for wave energy development of all 23 coastal states
   in the United States ill. Today, however, almost five years after the
   EPRI study was published, there is not a single commercial wave energy
   project in the waters off Oregon. Why? Does public opinion have anything
   to do with it? How should public opinion be interpreted?
   This study provides some insight and understanding about the
   determinants of public opinion with regard to renewable energy, the role
   these determinants play in public opinion formulation, and their
   relative importance in citizens' support of or opposition toward wave
   energy development in Oregon. The findings of a statewide survey reveal
   that the typical respondent is supportive of wave energy development,
   even though s/he does not consider herself/himself well informed about
   renewable energy, and that s/he is least knowledgeable about wave energy
   of all renewable options. These results indicate that increased outreach
   efforts for wave energy are warranted; especially considering the fact
   that 83\% of respondents believe it is ``possible to increase energy
   supplies while protecting the environment at the same time{''}.},

Abstract = {The integration of cover crops (CC) into annual crop rotations improves
   the provision of multiple ecosystem services in time and represents an
   alternative paradigm to achieve sustainability goals. In spite of the
   benefits that several authors have exposed, CC are seldom included in
   rotations because their water consumption could affect cash crops
   development. We evaluated the possibility of including CC in the
   agricultural area of Rio de la Plata grasslands and identified its
   optimal duration depending on both environmental conditions and crop
   rotations. Fallow areas were located based on NDVI time series derived
   from MOMS satellite images and the influence of CC on the subsequent
   cash crop was evaluated based on modeled changes in soil water contents
   at the sowing date of the cash crop. Our land use classifications
   revealed that single crop rotations, mostly summer crops with winter
   fallow periods, occupy a large proportion (89\%) of the agricultural
   portion of the Rio de la Plata grasslands studied. In most of the
   region, sowing CC of 3 to 5 months of length during fallow periods had
   little impact on soil water contents at the sowing date of the following
   cash crop. As expected, the optimal CC duration in the different
   sub-regions increased with the average rainfall occurred during the
   fallow period. The possibility of sowing CC without affecting cash crops
   yields opens the opportunity for intensifying crop sequences in the
   region, oriented to mitigate environmental concerns raised by
   monocultures and agricultural simplification.},

Title = {Improving prediction of soil organic carbon content in croplands using
   phenological parameters extracted from NDVI time series data},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mapping the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or
   stock is important for climate change studies and land management
   decisions. When using environmental covariates to map SOC content or
   stock, variables indicating human activities have drawn growing
   attentions. Crop species/crop rotations and agricultural management
   significantly affect the spatial variation of SOC in croplands. For
   areas where climatic conditions and farming managements are generally
   consistent in cultivation territory of one crop species, crop phenology
   largely indicates the crop response to soil. Therefore, phenological
   parameters incorporating with crop rotation could be effective for
   mapping soil organic carbon in these areas. In this study, we extracted
   phenological parameters from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) time series data, and used these variables with crop rotation for
   predicting topsoil organic carbon content in a cropland area in Anhui
   province, China. Forty-nine sampling points were collected in field. For
   these points, there were three crop rotations each with two crop species
   per year. Twenty-two HJ-1 A/B images for 2010 year with a 30 m
   resolution were obtained. Eleven phenological parameters for each of the
   two growing seasons were obtained with a dynamic threshold method.
   Various combinations of predictive variables were developed based on
   variable importance and experimented for predicting topsoil organic
   carbon using random forest. The prediction results were validated using
   a cross validation approach. Results showed that base levels (given as
   the average of the left and right minimum values of a time series
   profile) for both seasons were the most important predictors in this
   area. Adding both crop rotation and the two phenological parameters to
   the natural environment variables increased the prediction accuracies by
   50\% in terms of R-2 and 13.4\% in terms of root mean square error
   (RMSE). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of crop phenology in
   mapping SOC in croplands.},

Title = {Monitoring and forecasting heat island intensity through multi-temporal
   image analysis and cellular automata-Markov chain modelling: A case of
   Babol city, Iran},

Abstract = {An urban heat island is one of the most vital environmental risks in
   urban areas. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial-temporal
   patterns of land use changes and heat island intensity for the city of
   Babol, Iran, between 1985 and 2015 and to predict likely future heat
   island intensity variations. Multi-temporal Landsat images were acquired
   and analysed in this study. First, single channel algorithms were used
   to calculate the land surface temperature (LST), and a Maximum
   Likelihood Algorithm was utilized to classify images. Second, land use
   changes (LUCs) and LST were examined, and the relationship between the
   fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and land-use changes was analysed
   using the normalized land surface temperature. By using the mean and the
   standard deviation of the normalized thermal images, the area was
   divided into five thermal categories: very low, low, medium, high and
   very high. Then, by applying the heat island intensity index, the heat
   island changes in the studied period were investigated. Possible future
   land use changes were investigated using a cellular automata-Markov
   model, and the heat island intensity changes were anticipated. The
   results indicate that the area of built-up land increased by 92\%
   between 1985 and 2015, and that the area of agricultural land noticeably
   decreased. The built-up land changes trend has an inverse relationship
   with the trend of FVC changes and follows the same trend as the
   normalized surface temperature changes. Most changes in the surface
   temperature of the area are located within 0-800 m of a built-up area.
   The main reason for these changes could be the conversion of
   agricultural and green space land areas into built-up land. The largest
   area of the temperature categories in all years is the medium
   temperature category, which covers the suburban land areas. The low- and
   very low temperature categories, which follow a decreasing trend, are
   related to land areas far from the city. In addition, the high- and very
   high-temperature categories, whose areas increased annually, are
   adjacent to the city core and the exits from the city. The average
   surface temperature in all land uses increased during the studied
   period. Nevertheless, the rate of temperature rise is higher in the
   built-up uses. The index ratio of the heat island during this period
   shows an increasing trend, and its value changed from 0/5 in 1985 to
   0/67 in 2015. An increase in the heat island intensity has a direct
   relationship with the area population growth and, thus, the increase in
   the built-up land area. Anticipation of land use changes and the process
   of heat island intensity variations for the studied area show alarming
   results that call for decision-makers to address this important
   challenge.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the experiences and results of the first GPS MOOC
   (Massive Open Online Course), including a worldwide laboratory involving
   thousands of participants.
   MOOCs have the potential to revolutionize education in the same way that
   the Internet has forever changed other industries. A MOOC is a free
   online course, typically with thousands of participants from all over
   the world. In this talk we describe the first GPS MOOC. This MOOC ``GPS:
   An Introduction to Satellite Navigation{''} was created by the authors
   for Stanford University, and is hosted by Coursera. The course ran for
   the first time in the last quarter of 2014, and will run again in 2015,
   starting shortly after the ION GNSS+ conference. Participation in 2014
   was astonishing: we had over 31,000 registrants from 192 different
   countries (for comparison: the UN has 193 member states). Of these
   registrants approximately six-thousand participated regularly in the
   class; three-thousand completed the whole course; and seventeen hundred
   participated in the handson labs.
   This MOOC was the first to make use of smartphones to create a worldwide
   laboratory for experiments conducted by the students. Since each
   smartphone contains a GNSS receiver, students could get hands-on
   experience, while at the same time collecting data on an unprecedented
   scale. The main idea of the laboratory was pedagogical: to teach the
   students about GNSS, and so the labs were conceived to be relatively
   simple. But the sheer scale of the class was such that we obtained very
   interesting results which we will present in this paper for the first
   time.
   The first lab studied GNSS accuracy, as experienced by smartphone users,
   both in the open and in urban environments. Open-sky GNSS accuracy with
   smartphones has often been claimed to be ``about 5 meters{''}, in fact
   this was the answer to an in-course quiz question in one of the
   lectures. In this lab, with over one thousand participants in one
   hundred countries, the measured mean accuracy, remarkably, came to 4.9
   meters. Even more interesting, the accuracy in urban areas showed a
   remarkable correlation with building height. So well correlated, in
   fact, that we are moved to propose a ``Law of Urban Multipath{''} that
   predicts GNSS position accuracy based on building height. We will
   explain this result in the paper, and show the data distributions
   supporting it.
   In the second lab, the students performed mission planning to predict
   when a particular satellite would pass (close to) overhead on one
   particular day. They then had to go outside at that time, and see if the
   GNSS receiver observed the satellite where it was expected. They
   recorded the time, their location, and where in the sky the satellite
   was observed. They then submitted this data online. Each student
   becoming part of a worldwide relay. As the data came in, they could tell
   who saw the satellite before them, and who would see it next. This was a
   memorable experience for everyone, linking people from a hundred
   different countries with no regard for borders or boundaries of any
   kind.
   In the third lab we returned to quantitative analysis of GNSS. Students,
   after learning about GNSS Front End analysis, compared the measured C/No
   in their phones to the expected value for a nominal design. Thus they
   characterized the RF performance of the GNSS in many of the world's most
   popular smartphones. Following this, they repeated the experiment in
   their homes, thus characterizing the signal loss through the different
   types of buildings. We collected this data and will present the results
   for the first time in this paper.
   We believe that this is the first time that experimental data like this
   has been collected on this scale. The results are interesting in their
   own right, while also a vision for what might be achieved with a
   worldwide team of highly motivated volunteers who will together collect
   data in more environments in a day than most of us will visit in a
   lifetime. Based on the success of this first MOOC, we are modifying the
   labs for the 2015 edition to collect more detailed data that will shed
   further light on the operation of GNSS worldwide. In the paper we will
   discuss the plans for future labs, and we welcome input from the ION
   community for ideas about what may be measureable, and what we can yet
   discover about our GNSS ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) represents only 1\% to 5\% of all
   breast malignancies and is an extremely aggressive subtype. At time of
   diagnosis, up to 85\% of patients will present with regional nodal
   metastases and up to 30 \% will have metastasis to distant organs. There
   is limited medical literature describing treatment guidelines for IBC
   during gestation. The best diagnostic tools are core needle and
   full-thickness skin punch biopsies to assess presence of dermal
   lymphatic invasion. Breast Ultrasound is preferred to mammogram, but
   mammography could still be done with proper fetal shielding. Ultrasound
   and Magnetic resonance imaging are used for staging. Pregnant patients
   should be managed with special attention to the health of the fetus by a
   multidisciplinary team. Treatment based on current guidelines consist of
   a sequence of systemic chemotherapy followed by mastectomy with axillary
   dissection (modified radical mastectomy), and even if good clinical
   nodal response to neoadjuvant therapy is obtained, sentinel node biopsy
   is not recommended. Radiation therapy is to be given once the baby has
   been delivered. Chemotherapy is not recommended in the first trimester,
   and anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, as well as targeted Her2-neu
   therapies are contraindicated during the length of the pregnancy. There
   is no evidence that early termination improves the outcome. However,
   given the poor prognosis of IBC, patients should be fully counseled on
   the risks and benefits of continuing or terminating an early pregnancy.},

Abstract = {The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is an important dataset for various
   applications such as hydrology, environmental sciences, urban planning,
   etc. Majority of the satellite-based medium resolution (30 m - 90 m)
   Digital Surface Model (DSM) products are freely available and widely
   used around the world. The generation of a DTM from these products is a
   tedious process. In this paper, a simple algorithm is developed to
   classify the ground and non-ground pixels in the DSM. The algorithm is
   tested on ALOS - World 3 D 30 m (AW3D30) DSM for small patches in the
   cities of Chennai, Mumbai and Cairo. Based on general assumption of the
   minimum elevation difference that exists between the ground and
   non-ground objects a slope threshold is used to initially classify the
   DSM. The elevations of the classified pixels are then used iteratively
   to assign counter values to the pixels. These counter values are finally
   used to classify the data and the ground pixels are interpolated using
   Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) technique to generate the DTM. The
   proposed algorithm is quantitatively assessed and has a Type I error of
   2.33\%, Type II error of 1.67\%, Total error of 2\% and Kappa
   coefficient value of 96\%. Additionally, R-2 and RMSE values of 0.9589
   and +/- 0.429 m were observed when compared against a reference DTM.},

Journal = {LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {48},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In animal research, validity and reproducibility of data are critically
   influenced by the microbial status of the experimental animals, One of
   the most crucial aspects of assuring quality in animal research is
   providing research personnel with confidence that experimental results
   will not be invalidated due to interference caused by infectious
   disease. An effective quarantine program is essential to providing this
   assurance. Quarantine programs are generally instituted to prevent the
   introduction of rodent pathogens into established specific-pathogen-free
   colonies in a facility, Therefore, programs should be designed to
   isolate newly acquired rodents until their health status can be
   determined and to maximize the probability that microorganisms of
   interest will be detected before the animals are introduced into (and
   thus, could potentially contaminate) established colonies. Important
   principles that are critical to designing an effective quarantine
   program will be discussed here, as will the practical implementation of
   these principles. Although quarantine programs may be costly in terms of
   time and effort, these costs must be balanced against the potential
   costs of disease outbreaks that could invalidate long-term studies,
   alter normal biological baselines, and cause the loss or necessitate re
   derivation of rare or valuable strains of rodents. Reducing the
   incidence of quarantine failures through appropriate program design and
   implementation helps to maintain the confidence of research personnel in
   the value of quarantine programs and in our competence as specialists in
   laboratory animal management and as partners in the research process.},

Abstract = {Particulate nitrate (p-NO3-) is a key component of atmospheric nitrogen
   (N) pollution and deposition. Stable N isotopes of p-NO3-(delta
   15Np-NO3-) can record sources of atmospheric N oxides (NOx). However,
   because N isotope effects between NOx and p-NO3-(epsilon(NOx -> p-NO3-))
   have not been constrained, the apportionment of atmospheric NOx sources
   remains not quantitative. By collating observation data of dual N-15 and
   O-17 isotopes and environmental parameters, we calculated epsilon(NOx ->
   p-NO3-) values and established a new relationship to constrain
   epsilon(NOx -> p-NO3-) values based on the O-17 anomaly of p-NO3-(Delta
   17Op-NO3-). By considering epsilon(NOx -> p-NO3-) values and using the
   Stable Isotope Analysis in the R model, we reevaluated the relative
   contributions between major fossil and non-fossil fuel NOx emissions,
   and we found that the latter had generally higher contributions (56\%
   +/- 5\%) than the former (44\% +/- 3\%) among different sites. This
   study improves the isotope tracing technique of atmospheric NO3- and
   informs that non-fossil fuel NOx emissions should be underscored in
   future emission management.},

Abstract = {The increasing loss of N and P is one of the greatest negative global
   consequences of agricultural advance. The aim of this study was to
   calculate an apparent N and P balance in the county of Benito Juarez
   during the 1989/90, 2002/03 and 2011/12 agroproductive periods, and
   relating the results achieved with the agriculture surface in each
   campaign. Initially, the N and P balance indicator was applied in all
   three campaigns. Then, the loss of nutrients per unit surface was
   established, based on data from satellite images of the county and the
   value of the N and P balances. As a result, remarkable temporal
   variations were observed with respect to the fertilized surfaces and the
   applied doses. Likewise, the growth of the agricultural area and
   alterations in the production values and yield of the crops stand out.
   The balances of both nutrients were negative in the three campaigns,
   showing a continuous generation of deficit balances, whit greater loss
   of tn of N than P per surface unit (km(2)). Obviously, agricultural
   sustainability is affected, so this study shows the nutrient situation
   in the county, establishing the need for a sustainable management of
   fertilization.},

Abstract = {The 13th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2013) Expert
   Panel reviewed and endorsed substantial new evidence on aspects of the
   local and regional therapies for early breast cancer, supporting less
   extensive surgery to the axilla and shorter durations of radiation
   therapy. It refined its earlier approach to the classification and
   management of luminal disease in the absence of amplification or
   overexpression of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)
   oncogene, while retaining essentially unchanged recommendations for the
   systemic adjuvant therapy of HER2-positive and `triple-negative'
   disease. The Panel again accepted that conventional clinico-pathological
   factors provided a surrogate subtype classification, while noting that
   in those areas of the world where multi-gene molecular assays are
   readily available many clinicians prefer to base chemotherapy decisions
   for patients with luminal disease on these genomic results rather than
   the surrogate subtype definitions. Several multi-gene molecular assays
   were recognized as providing accurate and reproducible prognostic
   information, and in some cases prediction of response to chemotherapy.
   Cost and availability preclude their application in many environments at
   the present time. Broad treatment recommendations are presented. Such
   recommendations do not imply that each Panel member agrees: indeed,
   among more than 100 questions, only one (trastuzumab duration) commanded
   100\% agreement. The various recommendations in fact carried differing
   degrees of support, as reflected in the nuanced wording of the text
   below and in the votes recorded in supplementary Appendix S1, available
   at Annals of Oncology online. Detailed decisions on treatment will as
   always involve clinical consideration of disease extent, host factors,
   patient preferences and social and economic constraints.},

Abstract = {This study was performed in two regions of central Chile: Libertador
   Bernardo O'Higgins y del Maule, to locate and characterize the remnants
   of schlerophyllous forests. This ecosystem has been subject of an
   intense and prolonged anthropic pressure resulting in notorious cover
   reduction and fragmentation. Despite its important biodiversity and
   endemism, these forests are ill represented in the Chilean system of
   environmental protection. We located the forest patches using satellite
   imagery and GIS followed by field verification. The patches were
   classified on the basis of forest structure and physiognomy into three
   situations: open, semi-dense and dense, and referred them to the
   municipality within each of the two regions. These municipalities were
   ordered by the size their forest cover, and a fragmentation analysis was
   performed in the top 14 units, using landscape indices. Results showed a
   very fragmented ecosystem, with great variation in patch size and
   spatial distribution. We present the forest cover for each situation in
   each municipality. In the selected municipalities we detail number of
   patches, mean size, density and patch characteristics. The results are
   then discussed in the context of landscape and lend use and, its
   possible value to design management programs at the scale of municipal
   units to protect and recover the forest.},

   (Exp Fluids 58:83. 10.1007/s00348-017-2331-0, 2017; Experiments in
   Fluids 59:120, 2018), is applied to real cyclists to enable the
   aerodynamic drag determination during sport action. This principle is
   based on large-scale stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   measurements over a plane crossed by the athlete during cycling. The
   momentum before and after the passage of the athlete poses the basis for
   the control volume analysis in the athlete's frame of reference, which
   returns the aerodynamic drag. This approach extrapolates aerodynamic
   studies towards more realistic conditions, compared to experiments
   performed in wind tunnels with scaled or stationary athletes. The
   measurement concept is termed Ring of Fire as the rider crosses a region
   of intense light. Two experiments are conducted, indoor and outdoor,
   with attention placed on the effects of the environmental conditions and
   the confinement of the measurement region. Stereo-PIV measurements
   feature a plane of approximately 2x2m(2), using neutrally buoyant
   sub-millimeter helium-filled soap bubbles (HFSB) as flow tracers. The
   drag measurement is obtained examining the wake produced by the athlete.
   It is observed that the drag value becomes independent of time after
   about 5 torso lengths from the passage. A statistical estimate of the
   drag is produced combining the results of several passages. Fluctuations
   of the drag value during a single passage are associated with the
   unsteady wake flow. Overall fluctuations among different transits are
   ascribed to the varying conditions of the airflow prior to the passage
   of the athlete. The experiments conducted outdoor exhibit significantly
   larger dispersion of the drag value, compared to the quieter conditions
   indoor. Repetition of the transit 10-30 times yields a basis for
   statistical convergence of the average drag value. The flow topology
   past the cyclist compares satisfactorily between both experiments and
   with wind tunnel experiments reported in literature. The current
   measurements clearly separate drag values from upright and time-trial
   athlete's positions, indicating the suitability of this principle for
   aerodynamic analysis and optimization studies.

Abstract = {A debate at the European Union Parliament was held on 13 November 2012
   on the Impact of early diagnosis and control of chronic respiratory
   diseases on Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA). The debate was held under
   the auspices of theCyprus Presidency of the European Union (2012) and
   represents a follow-up of the priorities of the Polish Presidency of the
   European Union (2011). It highlighted the importance of early life
   events on the occurrence of chronic respiratory diseases later in life
   and their impact on active and healthy ageing. Epidemiologic evidence
   was followed by actions that should be taken to prevent and manage
   chronic respiratory diseases in children. The debate ended by practical,
   feasible and achievable projects, demonstrating the strength of the
   political action in the field. Three projects will be initiated from
   this debate: The first will be a meeting sponsored by the Region
   Languedoc-Roussillon on the developmental origins of chronic diseases
   and ageing: from research to policies and value creation. The second
   project is being led by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Asthma and
   Rhinitis: Prevention of Asthma, Prevention of Allergy (PAPA). The third
   project is the GA2LEN sentinel network.},

Title = {A public private partnership to fight against malaria along the
   Chad-Cameroon pipeline corridor: I. Baseline data on
   socio-anthropological aspects, knowledge, attitudes and practices of the
   population concerning malaria},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {Background: Malaria is ranked as the major public health problem in
   Cameroon, representing 50\% of illness in less than five year old
   children, 40-45\% of medical consultation and 40\% of the annual home
   income spent on health. The Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COTCO)
   that exploits the Chad-Cameroon pipeline in Cameroon territory,
   initiated in 2010, a public private partnership project to control
   malaria along the pipeline corridor. A research component was included
   in the project so as to guide and evaluate the control measures applied
   in this pipeline corridor. This study presents the baseline
   socio-anthropological data as well as the knowledge, attitudes and
   practices of the local population concerning malaria, its transmission,
   management and prevention.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was undertaken in four
   sentinel sites (one site per ecological zone) along the Chad-Cameroon
   pipeline corridor. Three structured questionnaires were used for the
   survey. Two of them were addressed to the heads of households (one for
   census and the other to collect information concerning the
   characteristics of houses and living conditions in households as well as
   their knowledge, attitudes and practices concerning malaria). The last
   questionnaire was used to collect information on malaria management and
   prevention. It was addressed to women who had delivered a living child
   within the past three years. Interviewers were recruited from each
   village and trained for two consecutive days on how to fill the
   different questionnaires. All data were analysed at 5\% significant
   level using Epi-Info, SPSS and Cs PRO 4.0 STATA. Values of p <= 0.05
   were considered statistically significant.
   Results: Interviews were conducted in 2597 households (Bipindi 399,
   Belabo 835, in Meidougou 820 and Dompta 543). Whatever the study site,
   50\% of the heads of household were workers of the agro-pastoral sector.
   Most of the heads of household were men (average 77.4\% for men and
   22.6\% for females). The walls of households were mostly made-up of
   earth blocks and access to media was low. There were significant
   differences between mean ages and educational level of the heads of
   household. Significant differences were also observed between the
   characteristics of houses and the sites located in the southern regions
   (Bipindi and Belabo) and those located in the northern regions
   (Meidougou and Dompta). The later household heads were younger and less
   educated than those in the other regions.
   In most of the study sites, paracetamol was cited as the first intention
   drug for malaria treatment, followed by chloroquine, a banned drug. More
   than half of the households studied had a correct knowledge of malaria
   and its mode of transmission: 120/155 (77.1\%) in Bipindi, 244/323
   (74.5\%) in Belabo, 171/235 (72.8\%) in Meidougou and 118/218 (54.1\%)
   in Dompta. Fever and headache were the malaria signs/symptoms most often
   cited by the households. An important percentage of pregnant women did
   not take any malaria prophylaxis during their last pregnancy (up to
   43.4\% in Belabo).
   Conclusion: In all the study sites, there were conditions that indicated
   the all year round transmission of malaria (characteristics of houses
   and limited access to media making sensitization campaigns difficult).
   In general, most households had a good knowledge of malaria and its mode
   of transmission. However, malaria treatment drugs were most often
   inappropriate. In this study, recommendations were made in order to
   guide the implementation of control measures.},

Abstract = {The management of melanoma during pregnancy is challenging as maternal
   benefits and fetal risks need to be balanced. Here, we present an
   overview of the incidence, the demographic and clinical characteristics
   and the treatment modalities used. After analysis of obstetric, fetal
   and maternal outcome, recommendations for clinical practice are
   provided. From the `International Network on Cancer, Infertility and
   Pregnancy' database, pregnant patients with melanoma were identified and
   analysed. Sixty pregnancies were eligible for analysis. Fifty percent of
   the patients presented with advanced melanoma during pregnancy (14 stage
   III and 16 stage IV), and 27\% were diagnosed with recurrent melanoma.
   Surgery was the main therapeutic strategy during pregnancy. Only four
   patients with advanced melanoma were treated during pregnancy with
   systemic therapy (n=1) or radiotherapy (n=3). Premature delivery was
   observed in 18\% of the ongoing pregnancies, all which were induced and
   78\% of which involved patients with advanced melanoma. Thirty-nine
   percent of the patients died within 5 years; all had been diagnosed with
   stage III or IV disease during pregnancy. Melanoma can present in a more
   advanced stage during pregnancy. New systemic therapies may be
   beneficial for patients with metastatic melanoma but may not be
   pregnancy compatible. In these patients, preterm induction of labour
   need to be discussed, despite the short-term and long-term negative
   effects on the child. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All

   mainly distributed area of S. salsa, is an economic intensive region
   with the largest economic aggregate and population in northern China.
   The coastal wetland is one of the most vulnerable ecosystems with the
   urbanization and economic developments. S. salsa in Bohai Bay has been
   changed significantly due to several threats to its habitat in past
   decades. In this paper, we analyzed all available archived Landsat
   TM/ETM+/OLI images of the Bohai Bay region by using a decision tree
   algorithm method based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to
   generate annual maps of S. salsa from 1990 to 2020 at a 30-m spatial
   resolution. The temporal-spatial dynamic changes in S. salsa were
   studied by landscape metric analysis. The influencing factors of S.
   salsa changes were analyzed based on principal component analysis (PCA)
   and a logistic regression model (LRM). The results showed that S. salsa
   was mainly distributed in three regions: the Liao River Delta (Liaoning
   Province), Yellow River Delta (Shandong Province), and Hai River Estuary
   (Hebei Province, Tianjin). During the past 31 years, the total area of
   S. salsa has dramatically decreased from 692.93 km(2) to 51.04 km(2),
   which means that 92.63\% of the area of S. salsa in the Bohai Bay region
   was lost. In the 641.89 km(2) area of S. salsa that was lost, 348.80
   km(2) of this area was converted to other anthropic land use categories,
   while 293.09 km(2) was degraded to bare land. The landscape
   fragmentation of S. salsa has gradually intensified since 1990. National
   Nature Reserves have played an important role in the restoration of
   suitable S. salsa habitats. The analysis results for the natural
   influencing factors indicated that precipitation, temperature,
   elevation, and distance to the coastline were considered to be the major
   influencing factors for S. salsa changes. The results are valuable for
   monitoring the dynamic changes of S. salsa and can be used as effective
   factors for the restoration of S. salsa in coastal wetlands.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas are a noteworthy source of commercial and economic
   fortunes for surrounding municipalities throughout the Moroccan Atlantic
   coast. Thus, a deep knowledge of local hydrodynamics and environmental
   processes associated is integral to effective coastal management. 3D
   hydrodynamic model that includes a Lagrangian particle simulation can
   participate to this understanding of dynamics. The model was calibrated
   and validated against meteorological conditions, sea surface level,
   harmonic tidal constituents, water temperature and salinity using a
   combination of available in-situ measurements, satellite, and ARGO
   floats data. Subsequently, it was used to determine the pathway of
   passive tracers and estimate the local residence time (RT). Despite some
   discrepancies, the findings revealed a good match between simulations
   and observations, which underlines the feasibility of the model in
   predicting the main dynamic features of the Agadir bay. Overall, the
   hydrodynamics of the area is tidal dominated by semidiurnal tides (M2)
   and governed by westerly and northwesterly winds. Passive tracer
   simulations showed strong seasonal and spatial variability, conditioning
   the obtained RTs, with mean values much shorter during summer (3 to 9
   days) than winter (5 to 15 days). The tracers look to be trapped inside
   a coastal cyclonic eddy that increases the RTs in the southern bay,
   making it an area with highest likelihood of accumulation of pollutants
   while favoring the northward transport and decrease RTs in the northern
   bay.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas are subject to flood hazards because of their topographic
   features, social development and related human activities. The Kujukuri
   Plain, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, is located nearby the Tokyo metropolitan
   area and it faces to the Pacific Ocean. In the Kujukuri Plain,
   widespread occurrence of land subsidence has been caused by exploitation
   of groundwater, extraction of natural gas dissolved in brine, and
   natural consolidation of the Holocene and landfill deposits. The
   locations of land subsidence include areas near the coast, and it may
   increase the flood hazard potential. Hence, it is very important to
   evaluate flood hazard potential by taking into account the temporal
   change of land elevation caused by land subsidence, and to prepare
   hazard maps for protecting the surface environment and for developing an
   appropriate land-use plan. In this study, flood hazard assessments at
   three different times, i.e., 1970, 2004, and 2013 are implemented by
   using a flood hazard model based on Multicriteria Decision Analysis with
   Geographical Information System techniques. The model incorporates six
   factors: elevation, depression area, river system, ratio of impermeable
   area, detention ponds, and precipitation. Main data sources used are 10m
   resolution topography data, airborne laser scanning data, leveling data,
   Landsat-TM data, two 1 V 30 000 scale river watershed maps, and
   precipitation data from observation stations around the study area and
   Radar data. The hazard assessment maps for each time are obtained by
   using an algorithm that combines factors with weighted linear
   combinations. The assignment of the weight/rank values and their
   analysis are realized by the application of the Analytic Hierarchy
   Process method. This study is a preliminary work to investigate flood
   hazards on the Kujukuri Plain. A flood model will be developed to
   simulate more detailed change of the flood hazard influenced by land
   subsidence.},

Volume = {139},

Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching, associated with anomalously warm ocean
   temperatures over large regions, poses a serious threat to the future
   health of the world coral reef systems. Seasonal forecasts from coupled
   ocean atmosphere models can be a valuable resource for reef management,
   providing early warning of potential bleaching conditions, allowing for
   a proactive management response. Here, the ability of a dynamical
   seasonal forecast model (Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for
   Australia, POAMA) to forecast degree heating months (DHMs) in the
   tropical oceans is assessed, with particular focus on the 1997/98 El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and associated global bleaching events.
   The model exhibits useful skill in forecasting sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) across the tropical oceans for 1982-2006 and reproduced both the
   magnitude and distribution of DHM values observed during the 1997/98
   ENSO event. In general, observed teleconnections between ENSO indices
   and tropical SST at various lags are well captured by the model. In
   particular, strong observed correlations between peak ENSO indices and
   SST in the Caribbean in the following summer were reproduced. The model
   also shows skill in predicting ocean conditions conducive to bleaching
   in non-ENSO years, capturing the anomalously warm conditions in the
   Caribbean region in 2005. Probabilistic forecasts of DHM values above
   certain thresholds for the Caribbean show useful skill and could be
   valuable in the assessment of the likelihood of bleaching for the
   region.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta plays important roles in protecting
   coasts from soil erosion and strong waves, supplying seafood, and
   accumulating carbon. Despite these benefits, mangroves have been and
   continue to be severely damaged by the impacts of natural and
   socioeconomic activities. In recent years, large areas of mangrove
   forest have been restored through planting and other various management
   actions. In this study, we analyzed high-resolution WorldView-2 images
   to quantify changes in the mangrove forest in seven coastal provinces
   (Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Kien
   Giang) of the Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020. Our study is one of the
   first to analyze mangrove forest change at the commune scale, the
   smallest official administrative unit in Vietnam, to determine the area
   of restored mangroves. The potentials and challenges in future mangrove
   restoration were also assessed by analyzing satellite imagery and field
   survey data. In the study area, mangrove forest area increased by 11,184
   ha (approximately 2,237 ha per year) from 79,593 ha in 2015 to 90,777 ha
   in 2020. A total area of 16,138 ha (approximately 20.3\%) was lost due
   to mangrove conversion to other land uses, aquaculture activities and
   coastal erosion, etc., while 27,322 ha (approximately 34.1\%) was
   restored or newly planted during state- and NGO-funded mangrove
   restoration projects and programs. These results confirmed that mangrove
   restoration projects and programs have played a significant role in
   maintaining and increasing mangrove forest cover in Mekong Delta. The
   results can also assist managers and decision makers in mangrove
   restoration evaluation, and suggest analyzing WorldView-2 images to
   monitor mangrove restoration over time in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {Wireless Networks using 802.16 WiMAX Technology in a ``Fly-Away{''}
   Communications (FLAC) package. Terrestrial communication networks
   continue to evolve very fast, with the extension offered by new IEEE
   802.16 promising, critical advantages benefiting civilian, government,
   Homeland Security, and crisis management in addition to the commercial
   market. A real world situation, such as the recent Tsunami in South East
   Asia is a good example of a complete collapse of the existing
   communications infrastructure from a natural disaster. Millions of
   people were left with virtually no way to communicate to family,
   emergency responders, or potential relief supporters.
   Remarkable results were achieved by a group led by the Naval
   Postgraduate School (NPS) in establishing an ad-hoc communications
   network using a satellite ground station, an IEEE 802.16 router
   servicing an 802.11 cell phone network in Thailand shortly after all
   communication infrastructure was lost to the recent Tsunami. Although it
   was pieced together with available equipment provided by various
   companies (who will be credited in the presentation), an effective
   communications grid was quickly established, providing critical
   connectivity to the world from the crisis area. This event gave rise to
   the concept that a standard ``Fly-Away{''} mobile communications network
   was a critical asset for world associations such as the UN, FEAM, Red
   Cross, NATO, etc. that could be procured via a GSA catalog by anyone and
   used to support rural, and disaster areas that have either lost, or just
   do not have a communications infrastructure in place.
   Military versions would connect to future Transformation Communications
   systems being designed, such as TSAT MUOS, JTRS, IWN, all designed to
   provide a high band width, multimedia communication backbone.
   The evolving capabilities of 802.16 are the natural extension of the
   terrestrial Global Information Grid to mobile platforms, as well as
   taking the information that ``Last mile{''} to provide basic
   communication, telemedicine and situational awareness.

Abstract = {A good understanding of acoustic coverage and temporal variation
   relative to environmental conditions is crucial for accurate
   interpretation of results from acoustic tracking studies and ensuing
   appropriate management recommendations.
   In their recent paper, Gjelland \& Hedger (Methods in Ecology and
   Evolution, 2017) suggest that the general detection probability model
   proposed by Gjelland \& Hedger (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2013,
   4, 665-674) was not appropriately used in Huveneers et al. (Methods in
   Ecology and Evolution, 2016, 7, 825-835). The intent of the comparison
   in Huveneers et al. (2016) was to evaluate the Acoustic Propagation
   Model (APM) in a situation when parameterisation is not logistically
   feasible. This can be the case when reference tags have not been
   deployed, or when the distance between tagged animals and receivers
   cannot be accurately estimated or cannot be obtained under sufficiently
   varied weather conditions. Even when parameterisation is possible, there
   will be situations where the APM does not account for all factors
   affecting detection probability, e.g. deep-water receivers where density
   gradients can affect sound propagation.
   Re-parameterisation of the APM based on clarification in Gjelland \&
   Hedger (2017) and application to a deep-water cross-shelf receiver array
   showed similar detection range to a logistic model until about (similar
   to)750m distance, after which the APM resulted in unrealistically high
   detection probability estimates. The need for large amounts of data to
   parameterise the APM and achieve good statistical fit negates the value
   of the theoretical propagation model. Detection range can also be
   affected by a broad range of factors, many of which are not included
   within the APM. The complexity of the way different environmental
   factors can influence acoustic detections and the variability of
   environments in which acoustic tracking studies are undertaken make it
   challenging to develop a general model applicable across environments.
   We support further improvement of the APM and recommend the use of
   reference tags to collect necessary data to parameterise the APM and
   assess factors influencing detection probability.},

Title = {The cost of renal dialysis in a UK setting - a multicentre study},
Journal = {NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1982-1989},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background. The UK National Health Service (NHS) will fund renal
   services using Payment by Results (PbR), from 2009. Central to the
   success of PbR will be the creation of tariffs that reflect the true
   cost of medical services. We have therefore estimated the cost of
   different dialysis modalities in the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust and six
   other hospitals in the UK.
   Methods. We used semi-structured interviews with nephrologists, head
   nurses and business managers to identify the steps involved in
   delivering the different dialysis modalities. We assigned costs to these
   using published figures or suppliers' published price lists. The study
   used mixed costing methods. Dialysis costs were estimated by a
   combination of microcosting and a top-down approach. Where we did not
   have access to detailed accounts, we applied values for Cardiff.
   Results. The most efficient modalities were automated peritoneal
   dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the
   mean annual costs of which were 21 pound 655 and 15 pound 570,
   respectively. Hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) cost 35 pound 023 per
   annum and satellite-unit-based HD cost 32 pound 669. The cost of
   home-based HD was 20 pound 764 per year (based on data from only one
   unit). The main cost drivers for PD were the costs of solutions and
   management of anaemia. For HD they were costs of disposables, nursing,
   the overheads associated with running the unit and management of
   anaemia.
   Conclusions. Renal tariffs for PbR need to reflect the true cost of
   dialysis provision if choices about modalities are not to be influenced
   by erroneous estimates of cost. Knowledge of the true costs of
   modalities will also maximize the number of established renal failure
   patients treated by dialysis within the limited funds available from the
   NHS.},

Abstract = {The actual process of rapid urbanisation is associated with various
   ecological, social and economic changes in both the urban area and the
   adjacent natural environment. To keep up with the effects and impacts of
   this development, effective urban and regional planning requires
   accurate and up-to-date information on the urban dynamics. Recent
   studies have proven the applicability of high resolution optical
   satellite data for the acquisition of some of the requisite spatial and
   socio-economic information.
   Although radar data is more reliably available than optical imagery,
   high resolution radar imagery has barely been employed for urban
   applications so far. This fact is mainly due to a lack of civil space
   borne radar systems featuring a ground resolution which is suitable for
   the analysis of urban structures. Additionally significant difficulties
   concerning the interpretation of according data over highly structured
   urban areas occur. The german TerraSAR-X system will provide radar
   imagery with a spatial resolution comparable to actual high resolution
   optical platforms.
   This study investigates the potential use of high resolution radar data
   in the context of urban applications. Thereby a concept - that was
   developed on the basis of SAR data recorded by DLR's airborne E-SAR
   system - will be adapted to an analysis of TerraSAR-X imagery. It
   introduces a temporally and spatially robust approach towards an
   automated analysis of the urban structure. For that purpose data sets of
   single-polarised X-band imagery are analysed by means of an
   object-oriented classification. This study includes the development of
   an improved image segmentation procedure in order to create meaningful
   spatial entities. Moreover, it contains the definition and application
   of a rule base for the detection of built-up areas, the derivation of
   the urban land cover and the generation of additional value-added
   information related to the urban structure.},

Abstract = {Oceans continuously interact with the overlying atmosphere, which
   dynamically varies and significantly impacts the weather and climate.
   The data over the oceans is complex and time series observations are
   vital. The knowledge we acquire from the data collected will help us to
   manage in oceans long term. Recent developments in ocean observation
   platforms and the advancements in sensor technologies have paved the way
   for modern and reliable deep sea instrumented buoy systems that offer
   most suitable and dependable platforms for uninterrupted data collection
   and transmission of the data in real-time to the shore through satellite
   communication networks. Ocean Observation Systems, an operational
   programme of National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, under
   Ministry of Earth Sciences, Govt. of India has been deploying and
   maintaining moored data buoys in Indian waters since 1997. The data,
   received in compressed numerical data packets, takes a reasonable amount
   of time to decipher, infer and uncover some of the potentially valuable
   information it contains. Hence, validation and analysis of the data for
   making decisions during natural hazards has become colossal and
   relatively complicated. The challenge is to develop a rugged mechanism
   the harnessing information technology to generate the information
   required for ocean sustenance, which warrants partnering with
   Information Technology. To modern societies, digital communications and
   information technologies have become fundamental and referred as
   ``connected society.{''}
   Scientific community expect data to accurately represent the phenomenon
   that was measured.The data collected over prolonged periods are of
   immense use for scientists, to carry out scientific analyses, and frame
   strategic policies. Today, precise electronics and high-performance
   computers have altered our expectations of scientific data management,
   much as it has altered the expectations for many other elements of
   society and we find portentous agreement with improved data management
   strategies. CORNEA - Centre for Ocean Realtime iNformation viEw and
   Archives is a high-end IT infrastructure built with computational and
   visual capabilities to bring significant benefits to ocean researchers.
   Large quantum of data received from buoys contain information about
   various parameters such as meteorlogical, oceanographic (surface and
   subsurface). Mining them for predictive analysis and tracking the
   history of sensors is a challenge. This stresses the need for automated
   mechanism to collage the information and present it on demand,
   minimizing the challenges faced retrieving the same through manual
   means. ADDRESS (ADvanced Data REception and AnalysiS System) is a
   software tool developed for visualization within the context of data and
   information, heuristic way of interpretation, analysis, automated
   quality control, reliable data reception and dissemination using modern
   software technologies, which are the linchpin to a successful Ocean
   Observation Programme driven in the Information Technology era. Further,
   the buoy data is disseminated to the global community through Global
   Telecommunication Systems (GTS). The data and metadata from Indian buoy
   programme is acclaimed by the global scientific community. Ocean Best
   Practices methodology recognized by ``International Oceanographic Data
   and Information Exchange{''} (IODE) of the Intergovernmental
   Oceanographic Commission (IOC) - UNESCO, is adopted to achieve quality
   and consistency in observation.
   Data from Indian buoy programme is also portrayed in OceanOPS (formerly
   JCOMMOPS), the agency that establishes a common platform, coordinates
   within and amongst ocean observation communities across the globe. Apart
   from regional, data from collaborative projects such as OMNI-RAMA are
   exhibited through interactive webportals with wealth of data and
   information to the scientific community blending international efforts.
   The culmination of this paper reveals how technology, confined is
   standards and best practices deployed, transform the way the ocean data
   is accessed, utilized, augmented, and transformed into information and
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Geomorphological information can be combined with decision-support tools
   to assess landslide hazard and risk. A heuristic model was applied to a
   rural municipality in eastern Cuba. The study is based on a terrain
   mapping units (TMU) map, generated at 1:50,000 scale by interpretation
   of aerial photos, satellite images and field data. Information
   describing 603 terrain units was collected in a database. Landslide
   areas were mapped in detail to classify the different failure types and
   parts. Three major landslide regions are recognized in the study area:
   coastal hills with rockfalls, shallow debris flows and old rotational
   rockslides denudational slopes in limestone, with very large deep-seated
   rockslides related to tectonic activity and the Sierra de Caujeri scarp,
   with large rockslides. The Caujeri scarp presents the highest hazard,
   with recent landslides and various signs of active processes. The
   different landforms and the causative factors for landslides were
   analyzed and used to develop the heuristic model. The model is based on
   weights assigned by expert judgment and organized in a number of
   components such as slope angle, internal relief, slope shape, geological
   formation, active faults, distance to drainage, distance to springs,
   geomorphological subunits and existing landslide zones. From these
   variables a hierarchical heuristic model was applied in which three
   levels of weights were designed for classes, variables, and criteria.
   The model combines all weights into a single hazard value for each pixel
   of the landslide hazard map. The hazard map was then divided by two
   scales, one with three classes for disaster managers and one with 10
   detailed hazard classes for technical staff The range of weight values
   and the number of existing landslides is registered for each class. The
   resulting increasing landslide density with higher hazard classes
   indicates that the output map is reliable. The landslide hazard map was
   used in combination with existing information on buildings and
   infrastructure to prepare a qualitative risk map. The complete lack of
   historical landslide information and geotechnical data precludes the
   development of quantitative deterministic or probabilistic models. (c)

Title = {Public libraries and difficulties with targeting the homeless},
Journal = {LIBRARY REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to consider the potential for public library
   policies that specifically target ``the homeless{''} to undermine their
   own objectives, and seeks to suggest alternative approaches to extend
   inclusion and ensure that all demographics are served equally.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper was written for a satellite
   meeting of the 78th IFLA Congress entitled ``The Homeless and the
   Libraries - the Right to Information and Knowledge For All{''}. Drawing
   on previous research detailed in Muggleton, and Muggleton and Ruthven,
   the author presents a discursive perspective on the impact that
   assumptions about homelessness might have for policymaking.
   Findings - Extant prejudices and the tendency to create a homeless
   ``other{''} mean that policies specifically addressing the homeless have
   the potential to accentuate difference and patronise and alienate the
   intended beneficiaries of these policies. Moreover, political opposition
   to more inclusive, accommodating policymaking makes it important to
   reject assumptions and prejudices that weaken one's own position.
   Grounding policymaking in the empirical experience of homeless library
   users is argued to be the most effective way to extend inclusion, and
   also avoid false dichotomies and the perpetuation of prejudice.
   Originality/value - Insights into unconscious assumptions gathered from
   previous research have been applied to the conceptualisation and
   implementation of public library policy. The arguments presented in the
   paper will hopefully be of use both for developing effective policies
   and for defending policies relating to homeless library users.},

Title = {Can clitoris-conserving surgery for early vulvar cancer improve the

Abstract = {Objectives: Vulvar carcinomas(VC) and vulvar in situ cancers (VCIS) are
   rare genital malignancies. Total vulvectomy as the standard of care has
   been replaced by local excision during the early stages of the disease.
   We studied whether conservation of the clitoris in vulvar surgery has a
   positive effect on either the quality of life (QoL) or the sexual
   sensation of the patient.
   Study design: In a retrospective study, patients with and without
   clitoris-sparing surgery were interviewed using the Female Sexual
   Function Index questionnaire (FSFI) and the Short Form 12 questionnaire
   (SF-12). The frequencies of high and low levels and the medians were
   compared using the Cox-Mantel, Chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests.
   Results: We identified 24 patients who had surgery in our department for
   VCIS or VC stage I/II, between 2006 and 2008. Ten of these patients
   required total inguinal lymphadenectomies and another five required
   sentinel node biopsies. In twelve patients, the clitoris had been
   spared, whereas in the remaining twelve, the clitoris had needed to be
   removed. These groups did not differ in terms of tumor size, stage, type
   of surgery or age of the patients. The evaluation of the SF-12 indicated
   high satisfaction in the physical scores for 33\% of patients with
   clitoris-sparing surgery vs. 67\% after clitoris resection (n.s.). For
   the mental domain, the rates were 58\% and 67\% (n.s.), respectively. In
   the FSFI, both groups showed comparable values <18 (n = 7) and >18 (n =
   5) in sexual sensation.
   Conclusion: Reducing the surgical resection is oncologically acceptable,
   but improvement in the patients' quality of life or sexual sensation is
   not achieved solely by conserving the clitoris. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Leeway, defined as the movement of the search object through water
   caused by the action of wind on the exposed surfaces of the object, is
   fundamental to search planning. Over the past several years, the U.S.
   Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (R\&DC) and the
   Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) have participated in leeway studies of
   various drift targets such as life rafts, evacuation vessels, sailboats,
   and other targets of interest. The leeway coefficients computed for each
   drift target generated from these leeway studies will be used in the new
   USCG Search and Rescue (SAR) planning software, the Search and Rescue
   Optimal Planning System (SAROPS), to define potential search areas
   during SAR operations.
   In the fall of 2005, the R\&DC conducted leeway testing of two specific
   drift objects on behalf of the U.S. Naval Submarine Medical Research
   Laboratory: the Mark-10 Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment (SEIE)
   life raft, and the Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon
   (SEPIRB). These studies were performed off the coast of St. John's,
   Newfoundland, Canada where open ocean conditions can be obtained within
   several miles from shore. Multiple drift runs were completed for each
   type of object to evaluate their behavior in response to various wind
   and sea conditions, producing object drift data under a wide variety of
   conditions.
   During the course of the study, each target was tracked by an on-board
   GPS receiver and data logger to yield high-resolution speed and
   direction over ground data. Wind velocity and sea conditions were
   measured by meteorological and wave rider buoys deployed within the
   study area to characterize environmental forcing conditions. The leeway
   of one SEIE raft was measured directly by a 1200 kHz acoustic Doppler
   current profiler (ADCP) gimbal-mounted and in a down-looking
   orientation, as well as multiple Self Locating Datum Marker Buoys
   (SLDMBs) that reported their respective positions via satellite at
   30-minute intervals. Leeway of the remaining objects was determined
   indirectly by subtracting the surface current vector of adjacent SLDMBs
   from the drift object vector motion recorded by its onboard GPS
   receiver. Because all search objects were in the vicinity of the SLDMB
   field, a comparison between the direct and indirect leeway motion could
   be made for the ADCP-equipped SEIE raft. This value was then correlated
   to recorded wind speed and direction, and subjected to error analysis
   and statistical validation.
   This paper focuses on the methodology employed during the field study
   and provides a detailed description of the post-processing routines used
   to derive leeway coefficients for the SEIE for U.S. Navy search
   planning, and for use by the USCG in its SAROPS planning software.
   Estimates of the surface current for each drift target to support
   indirect leeway calculations relied on a statistical interpolation
   technique and consisted of steps described in the paper below. The
   resulting time series constituted a data base for the calculation of
   downwind and crosswind leeway coefficients, derived from a least-squares
   linear regression between the corresponding velocity components of wind
   and target drift. The success of the indirect approach is evaluated by
   comparing the estimates with directly measured velocities. It was
   concluded that this statistical interpolation technique performed
   particularly well when the drifting target stayed within an imaginary
   polygon delineated by the available SLDMBs.
   Three of the four rafts considered in the study drifted with 12-15
   degrees leeway angles to the right of the wind direction. Downwind
   leeway coefficient was 0.02 for the drogued rafts and 0.03 for the
   undrogued rafts. Scatter of estimated leeway velocity with respect to
   wind speed suggested a tighter relationship for higher wind speeds (>7
   m/sec).},

Title = {Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of occult
   breast cancer: a SEER population-based study},
Journal = {CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {4381-4391},
Abstract = {Background: Occult breast cancer (OBC) is a rare type of breast cancer
   that has not been well studied. The clinicopathological characteristics
   and treatment recommendations for OBC are based on a limited number of
   retrospective studies and thus remain controversial.
   Patients and methods: We identified 479 OBC patients and 115,739 non-OBC
   patients from 2004 to 2014 in and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results (SEER) database. The clinicopathological characteristics and
   survival outcomes were compared between OBC and non-OBC patients. We
   used the propensity score 1:1 matching analysis to evaluate OBC vs
   non-OBC comparison using balanced groups with respect to the observed
   covariates. We further divided the OBC population into four groups based
   on different treatment strategies. Univariable and multivariable
   analyses were used to calculate and compare the four treatment outcomes
   within the OBC population.
   Results: OBC patients were older, exhibited a more advanced stage, a
   higher rate of negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor
   status, a higher rate of HER2-positive status, and a higher rate of >=
   10 positive lymph nodes, and were less likely to undergo surgical
   treatment than non-OBC patients. After adjustments for
   clinicopathological factors, the OBC patients exhibited a significantly
   better survival than the non-OBC patients (P<0.001). This result was
   confirmed in a 1:1 matched case -control analysis. Within the four OBC
   treatment groups, we observed no difference in survival among the
   mastectomy group, the breast-conserving surgery (BCS) group, and the
   axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)-only group. The multivariable
   analysis revealed that the sentinel lymph node dissection-only group had
   the worst prognosis (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: OBC has unique clinicopathological characteristics and a
   favorable prognosis compared with non-OBC. BCS plus ALND and
   radiotherapy showed a survival benefit that was similar to that of
   mastectomy for OBC patients.},

Title = {Intelligent Neutrosophic Diagnostic System for Cardiotocography Data},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Cardiotocography data uncertainty is a critical task for the
   classification in biomedical field. Constructing good and efficient
   classifier via machine learning algorithms is necessary to help doctors
   in diagnosing the state of fetus heart rate. The proposed neutrosophic
   diagnostic system is an Interval Neutrosophic Rough Neural Network
   framework based on the backpropagation algorithm. It benefits from the
   advantages of neutrosophic set theory not only to improve the
   performance of rough neural networks but also to achieve a better
   performance than the other algorithms. The experimental results
   visualize the data using the boxplot for better understanding of
   attribute distribution. The performance measurement of the confusion
   matrix for the proposed framework is 95.1, 94.95, 95.2, and 95.1
   concerning accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively.
   WEKA application is used to analyse cardiotocography data performance
   measurement of different algorithms, e.g., neural network, decision
   table, the nearest neighbor, and rough neural network. The comparison
   with other algorithms shows that the proposed framework is both feasible
   and efficient classifier. Additionally, the receiver operation
   characteristic curve displays the proposed framework classifications of
   the pathologic, normal, and suspicious states by 0.93, 0.90, and 0.85
   areas that are considered high and acceptable under the curve,
   respectively. Improving the performance measurements of the proposed
   framework by removing ineffective attributes via feature selection would
   be suitable advancement in the future. Moreover, the proposed framework
   can also be used in various real-life problems such as classification of
   coronavirus, social media, and satellite image.},

Title = {Quantifying the impact of terrain-wind-governed close-effect on
   atmospheric polluted concentrations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {367},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Rapid global urbanization and industrial expansion have resulted in
   severe atmospheric pollution sceneries in the past decades. Apart from
   the direct influence of anthropogenic emissions, the coupling of terrain
   and meteorological parameters may be another critical natural factor
   that indirectly impacts the dynamic polluted levels by means of terrain,
   wind, and planetary boundary layer governed accumulation and dilution in
   the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The nature-governed influence
   from the coupling of terrain and wind on air polluted levels can be
   called Terrain-Wind Close Effect (TWCE). As a value to represent the
   height of a geographic location above or below a fixed reference point,
   elevation cannot directly reflect the influence of terrain closed effect
   on air pollution levels at the regional/national scale. Therefore, this
   study aims to propose a Terrain-Wind Close Index (TWCI), which is a
   quantified comprehensive parameter of Earth terrain and atmospheric
   conditions controlling synergistically the localized or inhomogeneous
   concentration of fine particulate matters, to represent the
   nature-governed ability of terrain coupled with wind and boundary layer
   to block the dilution of contaminants. Results show a positive
   correlation (about 0.65) between TWCI and air polluted levels monitored
   by ground sites from January 1 to December 31, 2020 in China, which
   quantitatively exhibits that most of the high polluted levels existed in
   high-TWCI regions. The performance of the comprehensive TWCI in terms of
   its descriptive power on spatial pattern of surface polluted levels is
   superior to the single elevation (about 0.30) that widely used in
   previous studies. Moreover, the TWCI makes the static terrain dynamical
   by considering the synergistic effects of terrain and variational
   meteorological parameters on surface polluted levels. The newly proposed
   TWCI model has a potential to be applied to the research involve
   regional pollution estimation, environmental capacity assessment, urban
   planning and development, and so on.},

Abstract = {Population density estimations are essential for wildlife management and
   conservation. Camera traps have become a promising cost-effective tool,
   for which several methods have been described to estimate population
   density when individuals are unrecognizable (i.e. unmarked populations).
   However, comparative tests of their applicability and performance are
   scarce.
   Here, we have compared three methods based on camera traps to estimate
   population density without individual recognition: Random Encounter
   Model (REM), Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) and Distance
   Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS). Comparisons were carried out in
   terms of consistency with one another, precision and cost-effectiveness.
   We considered six natural populations with a wide range of densities,
   and three species with different behavioural traits (red deer Cervus
   elaphus, wild boar Sus scrofa and red fox Vulpes vulpes). In three of
   these populations, we obtained independent density estimates as a
   reference.
   The densities estimated ranged from 0.23 individuals/km(2) (fox) to
   34.87 individuals/km(2) (red deer). We did not find significant
   differences in terms of density values estimated by the three methods in
   five out of six populations, but REM has a tendency to generate higher
   average density values than REST and CT-DS. Regarding the independents'
   densities, REM results were not significantly different in any
   population, and REST and CT-DS were significantly different in one
   population. The precision obtained was not significantly different
   between methods, with average coefficients of variation of 0.28 (REST),
   0.36 (REM) and 0.42 (CT-DS). The REST method required the lowest human
   effort.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results show that all of the methods
   examined can work well, with each having particular strengths and
   weaknesses. Broadly, Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) could be
   recommended in scenarios of high abundance, Distance Sampling with
   camera traps (CT-DS) in those of low abundance while Random Encounter
   Model (REM) can be recommended when camera trap performance is not
   optimal, as it can be applied with less risk of bias. This broadens the
   applicability of camera trapping for estimating densities of unmarked
   populations using information exclusively obtained from camera traps.
   This strengthens the case for scientifically based camera trapping as a
   cost-effective method to provide reference estimates for wildlife
   managers, including within multi-species monitoring programmes.},

Abstract = {MDA has provided 25 years of real-time engineering support to Shuttle
   (Canadarm) and ISS (Canadarm2) robotic operations beginning with the
   second shuttle flight STS-2 in 1981. In this capacity, our engineering
   support teams have become familiar with the evolution of mission
   planning and flight support practices for robotic assembly and support
   operations at mission control. This paper presents observations on
   existing practices and ideas to achieve reduced operational overhead to
   present programs. It also identifies areas where robotic assembly and
   maintenance of future space stations and space-based facilities could be
   accomplished more effectively and efficiently.
   Specifically, our experience shows that past and current space Shuttle
   and ISS assembly and maintenance operations have used the approach of
   extensive preflight mission planning and training to prepare the flight
   crews for the entire mission. This has been driven by the overall
   communication latency between the earth and remote location of the space
   station/vehicle as well as the lack of consistent robotic and interface
   standards. While the early Shuttle and ISS architectures included
   robotics. their eventual benefits on the overall assembly and
   maintenance operations could have been greater through incorporating
   them as a major design driver from the beginning of the system design.
   Lessons learned from the ISS highlight the potential benefits of
   real-time health monitoring systems, consistent standards for robotic
   interfaces and procedures and automated script-driven ground control in
   future space station assembly and logistics architectures. In addition,
   advances in computer vision systems and remote operation, supervised
   autonomous command and control systems offer the potential to adjust the
   balance between assembly and maintenance tasks performed using extra
   vehicular activity (EVA), extra vehicular robotics (EVR) and EVR
   controlled from the ground, offloading the EVA astronaut and even the
   robotic operator on-orbit of some of the more routine tasks. Overall
   these proposed approaches when used effectively offer the potential to
   drive down operations overhead and allow more efficient and productive
   robotic operations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparison of Random Forest Model and Frequency Ratio Model for
   Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) in Yunyang County (Chongqing,
   China)},

Abstract = {To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR)
   model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected
   Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters;
   especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical
   records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a
   geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides
   in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into
   two datasets: 70\% of them were used as the training dataset and 30\% as
   the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors
   (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors;
   human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary
   conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library
   for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model
   training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the
   established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation
   in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis
   results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very
   low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of
   conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was
   explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and
   recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above
   two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances
   between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than
   the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF
   model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high
   and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the
   geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other
   hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable
   for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of
   its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The
   outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine
   learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and
   urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing
   demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility
   assessments.},

Title = {Small-Scale Livestock Production in Nepal Is Directly Associated with

Abstract = {Animal source foods (ASF) provide nutrients essential to child growth
   and development yet remain infrequently consumed in rural Nepal.
   Agriculture and nutrition programs aim to increase ASF intake among
   children through small-scale animal husbandry projects. The relationship
   between livestock ownership and children's consumption of ASF, however,
   is not well established. This study examined associations between
   livestock ownership and the frequency with which Nepali children consume
   eggs, dairy, and meat. We analyzed longitudinal 7-day food frequency
   data from sentinel surveillance sites of the Policy and Science of
   Health, Agriculture and Nutrition (PoSHAN) study. Data consisted of
   surveys from 485 Nepali farming households conducted twice per year for
   two years (a total of 1449 surveys). We used negative binomial
   regression analysis to examine the association between the number of
   cattle, poultry, and meat animals (small livestock) owned and children's
   weekly dairy, egg, and meat intakes, respectively, adjusting for
   household expenditure on each food type, mother's education level,
   caste/ethnicity, agroecological region, season, and child age and sex.
   We calculated predicted marginal values based on model estimates.
   Children consumed dairy 1.4 (95\% CI 1.1-2.0), 2.3 (1.7-3.0) and 3.0
   (2.1-4.2) more times per week in households owning 1, 2-4 and >4 cattle,
   respectively, compared to children in households without cattle.
   Children consumed eggs 2.8 (2.1-3.7) more times per week in households
   owning 1 or 2 chickens compared to children in households without
   chickens. Child intake of meat was higher only in households owning more
   than seven meat animals. Children's intakes of dairy, eggs, and meat
   rose with household expenditure on these foods. Small-scale animal
   production may be an effective strategy for increasing children's
   consumption of eggs and dairy, but not meat. Increasing household
   ability to access ASF via purchasing appears to be an important approach
   for raising children's intakes of all three food types.},

Abstract = {Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System (GH-LPS) is a
   ground-based positioning system, it can provide high-precision, high
   reliability, and high environmental adaptability independently within a
   limited area. The location services to make up for space-based
   navigation systems on the ground are limited by many factors. It mainly
   uses the carrier phase measurement value for positioning. To ensure its
   stable performance, it is necessary to detect and repair the cycle slip
   caused by high dynamics, signal impairments, and loss of lock on the
   signal. Therefore, in this paper, we establish the integration
   positioning model of Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning
   System /INS, we propose a method for using the inertial information to
   assist the Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System for
   cycle slip detection. We use the position information predicted by the
   INS to calculate the cycle slip detection decision, and use the
   hypothesis test to determine whether the cycle slip occurs and correctly
   identify the size and position of the occurrence of the cycle slip. The
   experimental analysis of the simulated and measured scenes validates the
   performance of the proposed algorithm for cycle slip detection,
   effectively detects the occurrence of small cycle slip. For the effect
   of different noise variance, the cycle slip detection method proposed in
   this paper can also keep the probability of accurate detection of cycle
   slips above 86\%. From the positioning result, detection and repair of
   cycle slip can improve positioning accuracy by 64\%.},

Title = {Regeneration and succession: A 50-year gap dynamic in temperate
   secondary forests, Northeast China},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Forest gaps are essential small-scale disturbances in forest succession.
   However, little attention has been paid to the long-term effects of gap
   dynamics on woody species regeneration and succession. We selected 20
   medium and 25 large gaps representing a range of age classes (0-10,
   10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 years) from remote-sensing images
   obtained in 1964, 1976, 1986, 1993, 2003, and 2014 to examine long-term
   gap regeneration processes in a secondary forest in Northeast China. We
   conducted field surveys to determine the regeneration status, density
   index (DI), and richness index (RI) of selected gaps. The importance
   value (IV) of each woody species was calculated, and all species were
   classified by shade tolerance. The results showed that in gaps of 0-10
   years, the DI and RI were mainly dominated by shade-intolerant species
   in large gaps and intermediate species in medium gaps. When gap age
   increased to 10-20 years, the greatest RI was observed in large gaps due
   to an increase in intermediate species, and the dominant species (IV >
   0.1) changed from shrubs to trees (Acer mono). The DI and RI decreased
   over time in medium gaps, but A. mono remained the dominant species in
   these gaps. By 20-30 years after gap formation, large gaps showed
   decreased DI and RI, associated with the exclusion of shade-intolerant
   and intermediate species, and Tilia amurensis joined the dominant
   species class. In medium gaps, a decrease in DI was associated with
   self-thinning among intermediate shade-tolerant species. Once gap age
   exceeded 30 years, the DI, RI, and dominant species became stable in
   both large and medium gaps. Our findings indicated that natural gaps can
   improve the regeneration of late-successional species in secondary
   forests, especially at the first 30 years. However, there was a barrier
   in succession of the secondary forests to climax forests relying on
   natural gap regeneration due to the absence of key species such as
   Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.). These results can provide
   a significant reference for close-to-nature management of temperate
   secondary forests in practice.},

Title = {Evaluating conflict surrounding mineral extraction in Ghana: Assessing

Abstract = {Since implementation of its Economic Recovery Program in 1983, Ghana's
   extractive industries have come to account for 40\% of the total value
   of the country's exports. An adverse impact of this increase, however,
   has been increased extraction-related conflict due to heightened
   competition between large and small-scale operators over mineral-rich
   lands. This paper characterizes these conflicts in the south-central
   section of the country by mapping the spatial overlaps between large and
   small-scale miners. Classification tree analysis of 2013 and 2015
   Landsat-7 and -8 imagery was used to identify small-scale mine sites.
   The overlaps between these sites and large-scale concessions are
   examined in the context of reported mining conflicts. Results reveal
   that there is a large amount of resource competition between the two
   parties, specifically, more than half (i.e., 52\%) of the identified
   small-scale mining activity occurs within the boundaries of large-scale
   concessions. The northwest corner of the study area contains 50\% of the
   identified overlaps; the southwest corner contains 40\%; and the
   northeast corner contains 10\%. In most cases, these overlaps take place
   on prospecting concessions. The work illustrates how mapping and
   quantifying areas of spatial overlap between large and small-scale
   miners can help stakeholders implement more effective policy solutions.

Title = {Reconstruction of Continuous High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature
   Data Using Time-Aware Implicit Neural Representation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate climate data at fine spatial resolution are essential for
   scientific research and the development and planning of crucial social
   systems, such as energy and agriculture. Among them, sea surface
   temperature plays a critical role as the associated El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) is considered a significant signal of the global
   interannual climate system. In this paper, we propose an implicit neural
   representation-based interpolation method with temporal information
   (T\_INRI) to reconstruct climate data of high spatial resolution, with
   sea surface temperature as the research object. Traditional deep
   learning models for generating high-resolution climate data are only
   applicable to fixed-resolution enhancement scales. In contrast, the
   proposed T\_INRI method is not limited to the enhancement scale provided
   during the training process and its results indicate that it can enhance
   low-resolution input by arbitrary scale. Additionally, we discuss the
   impact of temporal information on the generation of high-resolution
   climate data, specifically, the influence of the month from which the
   low-resolution sea surface temperature data are obtained. Our
   experimental results indicate that T\_INRI is advantageous over
   traditional interpolation methods under different enhancement scales,
   and the temporal information can improve T\_INRI performance for a
   different calendar month. We also examined the potential capability of
   T\_INRI in recovering missing grid value. These results demonstrate that
   the proposed T\_INRI is a promising method for generating
   high-resolution climate data and has significant implications for
   climate research and related applications.},

Title = {Evaluation of Insecticides Susceptibility and Malaria Vector Potential
   of <i>Anopheles annularis</i> s.l. and <i>Anopheles vagus</i> in Assam,
   India},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {During the recent past, development of DDT resistance and reduction to
   pyrethroid susceptibility among the malaria vectors has posed a serious
   challenge in many Southeast Asian countries including India. Current
   study presents the insecticide susceptibility and knockdown data of
   field collected Anopheles annularis sensu lato and An. vagus mosquito
   species from endemic areas of Assam in northeast India. Anopheles
   annularis s.l. and An. vagus adult females were collected from four
   randomly selected sentinel sites in Orang primary health centre (OPHC)
   and Balipara primary health centre (BPHC) areas, and used for testing
   susceptibility to DDT, malathion, deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin.
   After insecticide susceptibility tests, mosquitoes were subjected to
   VectorTest (TM) assay kits to detect the presence of malaria sporozoite
   in the mosquitoes. An. annularis s.l. was completely susceptible to
   deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and malathion in both the study areas.
   An. vagus was highly susceptible to deltamethrin in both the areas, but
   exhibited reduced susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin in BPHC. Both the
   species were resistant to DDT and showed very high KDT50 and KDT99
   values for DDT. Probit model used to calculate the KDT50 and KDT99
   values did not display normal distribution of percent knock-down with
   time for malathion in both the mosquito species in OPHC (p<0.05) and An.
   vagus in BPHC (chi(2) = 25.3; p = 0.0), and also for deltamethrin to An.
   vagus in BPHC area (chi(2) = 15.4; p = 0.004). Minimum infection rate
   (MIR) of Plasmodium sporozoite for An. vagus was 0.56 in OPHC and 0.13
   in BPHC, while for An. annularis MIR was found to be 0.22 in OPHC.
   Resistance management strategies should be identified to delay the
   expansion of resistance. Testing of field caught Anopheles vectors from
   different endemic areas for the presence of malaria sporozoite may be
   useful to ensure their role in malaria transmission.},

Title = {Piranha: A CORBA tool for high availability},
Journal = {COMPUTER},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {59-\&},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Distributed systems, such as satellite surveillance systems and
   real-time feeds for financial data, must be heterogeneous,
   interoperable, extensible, and available. Availability is a kind of
   fault tolerance: The system is able to provide important services
   despite partial failure of its computers or software objects. The Object
   Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture addresses
   only the first three characteristics. With respect to heterogeneity, for
   example, programmers can hide details of the underlying hardware and
   system software behind a portable interface, using CORBA's Interface
   Definition Language. IDL allows CORBA objects to invoke operations on
   each other even when implemented in different languages and even when
   running on incompatible operating systems. Wrapper objects and Object
   Request Broker (ORB) gateways enable interoperability by letting
   programmers interface new technology to legacy information systems.
   Finally, CORBA supports the development of highly modular applications,
   so programmers can more easily achieve extensibility-as well as better
   maintainability.
   To help address availability and reliability, the author developed an
   experimental CORBA-based restart service and monitor called Piranha (not
   related to the Yale University system).
   Piranha acts as a network monitor that reports failures through a
   graphical user interface. It also acts as a manager, automatically
   restarting failed CORBA objects, replicating stateful objects (objects
   that maintain an internal set of values) on the ny, migrating objects
   from one host to another, and enforcing predefined replication
   degrees-numbers of copies-on groups of objects.
   The article first examines the ways in which a CORBA ORB should support
   availability. It then explains how Piranha affords availability.},

Title = {Applying Information Theory and GIS-based quantitative methods to
   produce landslide susceptibility maps in Nancheng County, China},
Journal = {LANDSLIDES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1091-1111},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The main objective of the present study was to produce a landslide
   susceptibility map by implementing a novel methodology that combines
   Information Theory and GIS-based methods for the Nancheng County, China,
   an area with numerous reported landslide events. Specifically, the
   information coefficient that is estimated from Shannon's entropy index
   was used to determine the number of classes of each landslide-related
   variable that maximizes the information coefficient, while three
   methods, logistic regression, weight of evidence, and random forest
   algorithm, were implemented to produce the landslide susceptibility map.
   The comparison of the various models was based on the assessment of a
   database of 112 past landslide events, which were divided randomly into
   a training dataset (70 \%) and a validation dataset (30 \%). The
   identification of the areas affected was established by analyzing
   airborne imagery, extensive field investigation, and the examination of
   previous research studies, while the morphometric variables were derived
   using remote sensing technology. The geo-environmental conditions in
   those locations were analyzed regarding their susceptibility to slide.
   In particular, 11 variables were analyzed: lithology, altitude, slope,
   aspect, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, profile
   curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to faults, and
   distance to roads. The comparison and validation of the outcomes of each
   model were achieved using statistical evaluation measures, the receiving
   operating characteristic, and the area under the success and predictive
   rate curves. Each model gave similar outcomes; however, the random
   forest model had a slightly higher predictive performance in terms of
   area under the curve (0.9220) against the ones estimated for the weight
   of evidence (0.9090) and the logistic regression model (0.8940). The
   same pattern of performance was reported when the success power of the
   models was calculated. Random forest was slightly better than the other
   two models in terms of area under the curve (0.9350) in comparison with
   the weight of evidence (0.9255) and logistic regression (0.9097). The
   predictive performance was estimated by using the validation dataset,
   while the success power of the models was estimated by using the
   training dataset. From the visual inspection of the produced landslide
   susceptibility maps, the most susceptible areas are located at the west
   and east mountainous areas, while moderate to low susceptibility values
   characterize the central area.},

Abstract = {After almost 50 years from the last step on the Moon in 1972, Space
   Agencies and companies from all over the World are evaluating once again
   the need, potential, and benefits of human settlements on the Moon and
   beyond. Several spacecraft, landers, and rovers have already made their
   way on Earth's only natural satellite, and more will come in the coming
   years, followed by or in parallel with human missions, with all the
   related challenges and issues to overcome. At first, Human activities
   will target specific locations on the lunar surface, mainly driven by
   scientific objectives. For these missions, the landing site will
   necessarily be close to the target areas until a surface transport
   infrastructure is put in place, such as a system of transport rovers or
   a rail network. As the interest and involvement of public and private
   actors grow, and depending on their mission objectives, we will see
   either massive landings with multiple spacecraft involved or specific
   pinpointed landings with relatively small assets, to perform local
   analyses without the need to bring a full settlement to the location.
   Therefore, it is fundamental to see which resources/terrain
   characteristics will act as an attractor for intensive human activities
   with multiple landings that will need traffic management regulations.
   One of the objectives of our research is to analyze those potential
   attractors and identify key factors that would make specific locations
   of the Moon more suitable for landing (e.g. surface characteristics,
   distance from points of interest). Once defined, the following objective
   is to evaluate what features and services a landing site should have in
   order to support exploration or exploitation missions and become an
   efficient spaceport. In parallel, as mentioned above, all these
   activities on and around the Moon's surface need to be regulated and
   coordinated to avoid a ``far west{''}scenario, with the related
   potential hazards that could affect the lunar environment, human
   settlements, and facilities. The last objective of our project is to
   evaluate and propose ideas on how future missions could be regulated,
   taking into account that the Moon is a different celestial body that, at
   the current moment, is not under any national or international
   significant traffic management regulation. The present abstract is
   submitted under the auspices of Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC)
   Technical Unit Research for a Thriving Lunar Ecosystem (TURTLE).},

Title = {Temporal and Spatial Variation of Anthropogenic Heat in the Central
   Urban Area: A Case Study of Guangzhou, China},

Abstract = {The urban heat island effect caused by the rapid increase in urban
   anthropogenic heat has gradually become an important factor affecting
   the living environment of urban residents. Studying the temporal and
   spatial variation characteristics of urban anthropogenic heat is of
   great significance for urban planning and urban ecological service
   systems. In this study, the urban anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) in 2004,
   2009, 2014, and 2020 in the central urban area of Guangzhou was
   retrieved based on Landsat data and the surface energy balance equation,
   and the temporal and spatial characteristics of different types of
   anthropogenic heat were explored by combining the transfer matrix and
   the migration of the gravity center. The results showed that: (1) The
   overall change trend of anthropogenic heat in the central urban area of
   Guangzhou was enhanced, and the degree of enhancement was related to the
   type of urban functional land. (2) Different types of anthropogenic heat
   had different characteristics in terms of area expansion and spatial
   changes. Low-value anthropogenic heat (zero-AHF zone, low-AHF zone,
   medium-AHF zone) changed drastically in terms of area expansion.
   High-value anthropogenic heat (medium-AHF zone, high-AHF zone) changed
   more drastically in space. The increase in urban population, rapid
   economic development, and increased industrial production activities
   have stimulated the emission of anthropogenic heat, which has a positive
   impact on the intensity of anthropogenic heat.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses long-term and incremental land use changes that have
   taken place in Mount Rungwe ecosystem in Tanzania from 1973 to 2010
   basing on information derived from satellite images, household
   socio-economic data, focus group discussions and interviews with key
   informants. While most literature on land use change reports negative
   effects, land use changes in Mount Rungwe ecosystem have positively
   benefited communities through more diversification and greater
   commercialisation. The paper demonstrates that rural communities'
   livelihoods are both a cause and a result of changes in the natural
   Mount Rungwe ecosystem. The changes in land use through cropping
   patterns and reforestation took advantage of opportunities from
   population increase, access to markets and agricultural resources
   management. Consequently, the changes have qualitatively improved
   communities' livelihoods and forest ecosystems. The paper broadens our
   understanding on the potential land use changes in mountain ecosystems
   for enhancing rural livelihoods and the environment in line with the
   Boserup's agricultural intensification theory.},

Title = {A tool for rapid post-hurricane urban tree debris estimates using high

Abstract = {Coastal communities in the southeast United States have regularly
   experienced severe hurricane impacts. To better facilitate recovery
   efforts in these communities following natural disasters, state and
   federal agencies must respond quickly with information regarding the
   extent and severity of hurricane damage and the amount of tree debris
   volume. A tool was developed to detect downed trees and debris volume to
   better aid disaster response efforts and tree debris removal. The tool
   estimates downed tree debris volume in hurricane affected urban areas
   using a Leica Airborne Digital Sensor (ADS40) and very high resolution
   digital images. The tool employs a Sobel edge detection algorithm
   combined with spectral information based on color filtering using 15
   different statistical combinations of spectral bands. The algorithm
   identified downed tree edges based on contrasts between tree stems,
   grass, and asphalt and color filtering was then used to establish
   threshold values. Colors outside these threshold values were replaced
   and excluded from the detection processes. Results were overlaid and an
   ``edge line{''} was placed where lines or edges from longer consecutive
   segments and color values within the threshold were met. Where two lines
   were paired within a very short distance in the scene a polygon was
   drawn automatically and, in doing so, downed tree stems were detected.
   Tree stem diameter-volume bulking factors were used to estimate
   post-hurricane tree debris volumes. Images following Hurricane Ivan in
   2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 were used to assess the error of the tool
   by comparing downed tree counts and subsequent debris volume estimates
   with post-hurricane photo-interpreted downed tree counts and actual
   field measured estimates of downed tree debris volume. The errors
   associated with the use of the tool and potential applications are also
   presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Shoreline evolution of an urbanized coastal dune: M?edanos private
   neighborhood, Necochea, Argentina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {124},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The shoreline evolution among three stages (before, during and after
   urbanization and anthropization of a dune) was analyzed in order to
   determine the influence of hard structures on coastal dune's dynamics.
   Through the comparison of the shoreline position extracted from aerial
   photographs and satellite images, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System
   tool was used to calculate the rates of evolution. In every coastal
   zone, the first line of dunes (foredune) is essential to beach dynamics.
   Problems arise when buildings and/or land parceling take place at these
   areas. This scenario requires planning, aiming to promote the
   equilibrium in the marine littoral stripe, and the protection and
   conservation of its resources. The specifics results of the studied area
   indicate an advance tendency of the shoreline during two periods before
   the anthropization (1.25 m/year). During the development of the
   neighborhood, a retreat tendency of the same magnitude is estimated.
   After the neighborhood's devel-opment, this trend changed into an
   advance of the order of 0.5 m/year.Through the extended analysis and the
   zoned beach, shoreline trends in the prior periods of the construction
   of the neighborhood were to advance. During the construction period,
   both the SW and NE sectors evidenced minimal movements of their
   shoreline with values close to zero and, the neighborhood center side
   showed a retreat. Finally, during the most recent stages (2004-2014 and
   2014-2021), both sectors (SW-NE) showed slightly opposite trends, but
   also close to zero; center side showed an advance. This analysis,
   supported by oceanographic information on waves, tides and winds,
   suggests that during the period 1994-2004, there were no records that
   suggest an erosive potential. This shows a clear anthropic influence
   between 1994 and 2004 coincident with the neighborhood construction
   (1996) and dunes fixation.},

Abstract = {Analysis described in the paper were made in the frame of the PROZA
   (Operational decision-making based on atmospheric conditions,
   http://projekt-proza.pl/) project co-financed by the European Union
   through the European Regional Development Fund. One of its tasks was to
   develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support
   different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing
   the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather
   conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of
   the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG
   (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were
   performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels
   collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and
   track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking
   method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the
   temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using
   principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main
   benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its
   efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of
   the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that
   correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena,
   which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the
   weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model)
   forecasts. The paper presents analysis of exemplary MCSs in the context
   of near real-time prediction system development and proves that
   developed tool can be helpful in MCSs monitoring.},

Title = {Climate variability and implications for keeping rivers cool in England},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Water temperature (Tw) is a primary determinant of river ecosystem
   health and function that is strongly controlled by climate variability
   and change but mediated by catchment properties. We apply a nested
   analysis to: (1) evaluate how annual and seasonal mean Tw varied across
   England during the period 2000-2018; (2) assess the extent to which
   these regional-temporal dynamics correlate with the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO); and (3) quantify the impact of local climate
   variability on modelled daily maximum Tw for open, shaded and spring-fed
   river reaches. Such information is used to identify sentinel locations
   for long-term monitoring and reporting, to evaluate the true benefit of
   riparian shade management, and to assess the impacts of climate change
   on Tw. We draw on a national archive of nearly 1 million Tw values and
   data from a high resolution field experiment in central England.
   Nationally, annual mean Tw changed by-0.4 degrees C/ decade over the
   period 2000 to 2018, broadly in line with Central England Temperatures,
   although summer Tw changed by +0.6 to +1.1 degrees C/decade in parts of
   central and northern England. There were significant associations
   between summer Tw and NAO (rho = 0.64, p < 0.05), especially at sites
   above 300 m altitude (rho = 0.70, p < 0.01). The regional analysis
   reveals strongest links between summer Tw and NAO in northeast England
   and weakest associations in lowland regions of southern and east England
   with major aquifers. Hence, places with significant groundwater flows
   offer the greatest chance of detecting long-term signals in Tw that are
   not being driven by the NAO. Site-specific, logistic regression models
   of daily maximum Tw are found to be sensitive to the prevailing NAO
   phase during calibration periods. Such models show a thermal benefit for
   shaded sites compared with open sites that is one average 0.2 degrees C
   under negative NAO but 2.8 degrees C under positive NAO. Based on the
   findings from our nested analysis we suggest ways of optimising
   monitoring networks plus improving the appraisal of measures intended to
   keep rivers cool. In particular, we call for the creation of a national
   indicator of Tw for use in UK Climate Change Risk Assessments.},

   of grassland types, within environmental and flood risk models
   grasslands are frequently represented by a singular set of hydrological
   and structural parameters which belies their diversity and complexity.
   This study aimed to determine empirically the extent to which improved
   versus unimproved grasslands exhibit different hydrological
   connectivity. Working in SW England at neighbouring field sites with
   comparable slopes and rainfall regimes, we used unpiloted aerial
   vehicles to survey a tussocky Molinia caerulea dominated unimproved
   grassland field (MCUG) field and a Lolium perenne dominated improved
   grassland (LPIG) field. Using digital photogrammetry workflows applied
   to the overlapping aerial images, we produced a digital surface model
   (DSM) at 0.03-m resolution from which flow pathways were modelled using
   GIS and compared with 1-m LiDAR and DSM produced by a global navigation
   satellite system (GNSS). MCUG had longer, tortuous pathways through the
   dense tussock network with a drainage density of 2.54 m m(-2). This was
   significantly greater than drainage density in the LPIG (1.82 m m(-2)).
   As a result of this study, we rescaled the Manning's n value for MCUG
   according to photogrammetrically-derived roughness values. We suggest it
   should lie between 0.075 and 0.09. Our data shows that MCUG can play an
   important role in reducing overland flow impacts when compared to LPIG
   through lower connectivity which can delay run-off to rivers.},

Title = {Spatial Estimation and Visualization of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions for
   Campus Sustainability: The Case of King Abdullah University of Science
   and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A total of 21 metric tons of CO2 per person in terms of per capita
   emissions from consumption of energy was recorded in Saudi Arabia in
   2011 and forecasts have shown that this emission of CO2 is increasing.
   This poses the threat of climate change and global warming and therefore
   the need for the sustainability of the country. The Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia's Vision for 2030 addresses environmental sustainability that
   includes a reduction in CO2 emissions as well as diversified economic
   growth. Universities have been regarded as institutions with significant
   responsibilities to resolve the issues of sustainability as well as
   serve as role model to society by implementing a sustainability plan.
   This study established a spatial evaluation, estimation, and
   visualization of the CO2 emissions of King Abdullah University of
   Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. The data required for this
   study were collected from the overall coverage of the university campus
   buildings by transforming raster data from the satellite image to vector
   data in the form of polygons, and then multiplying the area by the
   number of floors of the individual building. ArcGIS 10.3((R)) (ESRI,
   Redlands, CA, USA) software was used for this campus CO2 emissions
   evaluation and visualization. The overall estimate of the CO2 emissions
   for the university campus was 127.7-tons CO2 equivalent. The lowest
   emission was 0.02-tons CO2 equivalent while the maximum value was
   20.9-tons of CO2 equivalent. By this ArcGIS-based evaluation, it is
   evident that geographically integrated model for campus estimation and
   visualization of CO2 emissions provides the information for decision
   makers to develop viable strategies for achieving a higher standard in
   overall campus sustainability and addressing the issue of climate
   change.},

Title = {Combining Tourism Economic Account and Tourism Employment Module for a
   best measurement of tourism at a sub-national level},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {99-113},
Abstract = {For more than 15 years, the World tourism organization and other major
   multilateral organizations have worked on the development of reliable
   tools for assessing tourism related to others economic activities in a
   country: the tourism satellite account. Its implementation at a
   sub-national level is a challenging endeavour and requires going beyond
   this framework. A regional tourism economic account is a good answer to
   the demand for regional tourism economic data and to highlight the
   problematic of employment with a tourism employment module. This
   combination sheds a new light on the role of tourism in creating,
   preserving and diversifying jobs in the economy. We developed a regional
   tourism economic account (RTEA), based on the supply-side, in order to
   take advantage of the existence a system of regional accounts and to
   respond to the lack of domestic tourism data. All these developments
   have been applied in a French overseas region, Reunion Island. The
   results show their feasibility. The others ultra-peripheral regions of
   European Union, others European islands and more generally small island
   tourism economies can benefit from this experience, (i.e. all regions in
   which a system of regional account has been implented). (C) 2016 Varna

Title = {Incidence and etiology of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated
   diarrhea among children under five years of age in low- and
   middle-income countries: Evidence from the Global Enteric Multicenter
   Study},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Diarrhea is a leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in
   low- and middle-income countries. While vaccines may prevent diarrhea
   infections for which children often receive antibiotics, the
   contribution of individual enteropathogens to antibiotic use is
   minimally understood. We used data from the Global Enteric Multicenter
   Study (GEMS) to estimate pathogen-specific incidence of
   antibiotic-treated diarrhea among children under five years old residing
   in six countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia before rotavirus
   vaccine implementation. GEMS was an age-stratified, individually-matched
   case-control study. Stool specimens were obtained from children
   presenting to sentinel health clinics with newly-onset, acute diarrhea
   (including moderate-to-severe and less-severe diarrhea) as well as
   matched community controls without diarrhea. We used data from
   conventional and quantitative molecular diagnostic assays applied to
   stool specimens to estimate the proportion of antibiotic-treated
   diarrhea cases attributable to each pathogen. Antibiotics were
   administered or prescribed to 9,606 of 12,109 moderate-to-severe cases
   and 1,844 of 3,174 less-severe cases. Across all sites, incidence rates
   of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated diarrhea were 12.2 (95\%
   confidence interval: 9.0-17.8), 10.2 (7.4-13.9) and 1.9 (1.3-3.0)
   episodes per 100 child-years at risk at ages 6 weeks to 11 months, 12-23
   months, and 24-59 months, respectively. Based on the recommendation for
   antibiotic treatment to be reserved for cases with dysentery, we
   estimated a ratio of 12.6 (8.6-20.8) inappropriately-treated diarrhea
   cases for each appropriately-treated case. Rotavirus, adenovirus
   serotypes 40/41,Shigella, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia
   coli, andCryptosporidiumwere the leading antibiotic-treated diarrhea
   etiologies. Rotavirus caused 29.2\% (24.5-35.2\%) of antibiotic-treated
   cases, including the largest share in both the first and second years of
   life.Shigellacaused 14.9\% (11.4-18.9\%) of antibiotic-treated cases,
   and was the leading etiology at ages 24-59 months. Our findings should
   inform the prioritization of vaccines with the greatest potential to
   reduce antibiotic exposure among children.
   Author summary Because diarrhea is the second-leading cause of
   antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income
   countries (LMICs), effective vaccines against diarrheal pathogens may
   have the collateral benefit of reducing antibiotic exposure and
   resistance selection in these settings. Whereas antibiotic treatment is
   only recommended for diarrhea cases with blood in the stool (which
   suggestsShigellaetiology), little is known about real-world diarrhea
   treatment practices in LMICs. We used data from a study of children
   experiencing diarrhea and matched, asymptomatic controls residing in
   LMICs of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to understand factors leading
   to antibiotic treatment of diarrhea cases, and the proportion of cases
   attributable to various enteric pathogens. We identify rotavirus
   andShigellaas the predominant causes of antibiotic-treated diarrhea at
   ages 0-23 months and 24-59 months; additional leading causes include
   adenovirus serotypes 40/41, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia
   coli, andCryptosporidium. We estimate that approximately 12.6 diarrhea
   cases receive antibiotics inappropriately for each appropriately-treated
   case in the study settings. Vaccines against prominent enteropathogens
   may substantially reduce antibiotic consumption among children in LMICs.},

Abstract = {A significant amount of research has been conducted in Southwest (SW)
   Japan on climate modeling, disaster management, earthquake prediction,
   precise positioning, datum definition, and reference frames. However,
   there is substantial scope for numerical modeling and forecasting of
   ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) variations over the region,
   which would be beneficial for further communication and navigation
   purposes. Therefore, in this study we examined spatio-temporal
   ionospheric TEC variations using long-term Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) measurements from 01 January, 2011 to 31 December, 2018
   through a modified Linear Time-series Model (LTM) and substantiated our
   findings by comparing them with those of the existing empirical Global
   Ionospheric Map (GIM) and Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods.
   We analyzed TEC variations at 10 permanent stations covering three
   districts of SW Japan, which mainly include the Kyushu district and
   parts of the Chugoku and Shikoku districts. To determine the performance
   of the LTM, the geomagnetic (Northern Polar Cap (PCN) and Disturbance
   (Dst)) indices were included, together with the additional solar and
   planetary geomagnetic disturbance indices (F10.7 and Ap). Our comparison
   results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values in terms of
   TEC units (TECUs) between the observed and the TEC predicted by the LTM
   vary from 1.57 to 1.66, which are better than those between the observed
   and the TEC predicted by the ARMA (1.84-1.93) and the GIM (9.67-9.84)
   TEC models. An analysis of the results emphasizes the superior
   performance of the LTM over the other models in terms of its
   discriminability of temporal, as well as spatial, components.},

Title = {Two decades of land subsidence in Kolkata, India revealed by InSAR and

Abstract = {Land subsidence due to the over drafting of groundwater has been a major
   environmental crisis for decades in Kolkata, one of the most populous
   and largest cities in India. In this study, we map spatio-temporal
   evolution of the land subsidence of Kolkata region using Interferometric
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis of ENVISAT (2003-2010), ALOS
   (2007-2011) and Sentinel-1 (2017-2021) data sets along with GPS position
   time series (2012-2015) and Piezometric level measurements. During
   2003-2011, the eastern part of the Kolkata City (east of Hooghly River)
   experienced similar to - 4 to - 12 mm/yr subsidence. Between 2017 and
   2021, several new subsidence zones were evolved towards west of the
   Hooghly River as a response to the rapid decrease in groundwater level
   in this region (similar to - 0.3 m/yr). However, during 2017-2021, the
   widespread subsidence pattern in the eastern part of the city became
   segmented into 5-20 km(2) patches of low (similar to - 2 to - 3 mm/yr)
   and significant deformation (> - 10 mm/yr). This local deceleration in
   the subsidence is reflected as a reduction in groundwater decline rate,
   probably associated with the improved artificial recharge scenario. The
   correlation of the decadal-scale land subsidence with groundwater level
   changes suggests an inelastic mechanism for the confined aquifer system
   of Kolkata. The present results and published seismic micro-zonation
   results together suggest that the areas having significant subsidence in
   Kolkata are associated with large Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values
   and thus are more vulnerable to seismic hazard.},

Abstract = {Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time.
   However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially
   woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to
   examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Triangulo
   Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32
   years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature
   surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the
   absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e.,
   grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby
   grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods
   (from 30.0\% to 0.0\% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from
   7.0\% in 1987 to 11.0\% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred
   within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse
   cerrado (from 34.2\% to 7.7 \%) and an increase in dense cerrado (from
   6.9\% to 39.8 \%). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied
   for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time
   (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/-
   0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss
   of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was
   the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such
   patterns are important to support plant management plans for the
   threatened Cerrado open plant formations.},

Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {To understand the development progress and relevant Frontier research of
   urban green space carbon sequestration, based on the core databases such
   as Web of Science, CiteSpace software, and bibliometric analysis methods
   were used to analyze the research status. The results showed that the
   number of papers on urban green space carbon sequestration research was
   on the rise. China and the United States had closer cooperation from the
   perspective of international cooperation institutions. Peking
   University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the US Forest Service
   made the greatest contributions to this research field. Analyzing the
   keywords and the literature co-citation map, it was inferred that the
   hot keywords of future urban green space carbon sequestration research
   include carbon sequestration, ecosystem services, and climate change. It
   was found that carbon sequestration of urban green space ecosystems
   research primarily focuses on the correlation between urban green space
   and ecosystem services, and UGS carbon sequestration accounting and
   urban green space management. Finally, two perspectives were proposed:
   1) Urban green spaces diversified ecological benefits are achieved
   through the function of carbon sequestration, and 2) Urban green space
   carbon sequestration accounting and urban green space management promote
   the development of urban green space. An overview of the international
   progress and basic state of urban green spaces and carbon sequestration
   theme research is presented in this paper, Additionally, it provides
   valuable references for future research and helps gain a comprehensive
   understanding of this field of research.},

Title = {Summer Maize Growth Estimation Based on Near-Surface Multi-Source Data},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rapid and accurate crop chlorophyll content estimation and the leaf area
   index (LAI) are both crucial for guiding field management and improving
   crop yields. This paper proposes an accurate monitoring method for LAI
   and soil plant analytical development (SPAD) values (which are closely
   related to leaf chlorophyll content; we use the SPAD instead of
   chlorophyll relative content) based on the fusion of ground-air
   multi-source data. Firstly, in 2020 and 2021, we collected unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral data, ground hyperspectral data, UAV
   visible-light data, and environmental cumulative temperature data for
   multiple growth stages of summer maize, respectively. Secondly, the
   effective plant height (canopy height model (CHM)), effective
   accumulation temperature (growing degree days (GDD)), canopy vegetation
   index (mainly spectral vegetation index) and canopy hyperspectral
   features of maize were extracted, and sensitive features were screened
   by correlation analysis. Then, based on single-source and multi-source
   data, multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least-squares regression
   (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression were used to construct LAI and
   SPAD inversion models. Finally, the distribution of LAI and SPAD
   prescription plots was generated and the trend for the two was analyzed.
   The results were as follows: (1) The correlations between the position
   of the hyperspectral red edge and the first-order differential value in
   the red edge with LAI and SPAD were all greater than 0.5. The
   correlation between the vegetation index, including a red and
   near-infrared band, with LAI and SPAD was above 0.75. The correlation
   between crop height and effective accumulated temperature with LAI and
   SPAD was above 0.7. (2) The inversion models based on multi-source data
   were more effective than the models made with single-source data. The RF
   model with multi-source data fusion achieved the highest accuracy of all
   models. In the testing set, the LAI and SPAD models' R-2 was 0.9315 and
   0.7767; the RMSE was 0.4895 and 2.8387. (3) The absolute error between
   the extraction result of each model prescription map and the measured
   value was small. The error between the predicted value and the measured
   value of the LAI prescription map generated by the RF model was less
   than 0.4895. The difference between the predicted value and the measured
   value of the SPAD prescription map was less than 2.8387. The LAI and
   SPAD of summer maize first increased and then decreased with the
   advancement of the growth period, which was in line with the actual
   growth conditions. The research results indicate that the proposed
   method could effectively monitor maize growth parameters and provide a
   scientific basis for summer maize field management.},

Title = {SBAS-InSAR-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Along the North
   Lancang River, Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Landslides pose huge challenges to the economic activities in
   mountainous areas at present, while large numbers of landslide disasters
   have developed in the Hengduan Mountains area in the eastern part of the
   Tibetan Plateau. Accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) serves
   as a critical measure to predict the serious risks that may be
   encountered in engineering activities. However, previous landslide
   susceptibility assessment can only play a limited role in the real-time
   analysis of current activities of slopes. In this study, the deformation
   rates of the slopes along the Lancang River were determined using the
   SBAS-InSAR technique. Meanwhile, the landslide susceptibility along the
   north Lancang River was assessed using the frequency ratio (FR), random
   forest and FR-RF models, and the precision of the assessment results was
   verified according to receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs).
   Finally, a refined landslide susceptibility map was developed by
   integrating the deformation rates and landslide susceptibility indexes
   (LSIs) using a contingency matrix. As indicated by the deformation rates
   calculated using the SBAS-InSAR technique according to ascending and
   descending data show that the RADARSAT-2 descending data yielded more
   precise deformation results. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of
   the three assessment models were 0.866, 0.897, and 0.916, respectively,
   indicating that the assessment results obtained with the FR-RF model are
   the most precise. In the upgraded landslide susceptibility map, the
   areas with high and very high landslide susceptibility increased by
   2.97\%. Meanwhile, a total of 563,430 grid cells showed an increase in
   landslide susceptibility, accounting for 11.15\% of all the grid cells.
   Most especially, the Xueru and Ritong areas exhibited a significant
   increase in landslide susceptibility, and it has been verified by remote
   sensing images and field surveys that both areas are subject to
   landslide risks. Therefore, the upgraded landslide susceptibility map
   has a better prediction performance and can provide valuable support for
   the decision making in the construction of major engineering facilities
   and the prevention and remediation of landslides.},

Title = {Local topographic wetness indices predict household malaria risk better
   than land-use and land-cover in the western Kenya highlands},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Background: Identification of high-risk malaria foci can help enhance
   surveillance or control activities in regions where they are most
   needed. Associations between malaria risk and land-use/land-cover are
   well-recognized, but these environmental characteristics are closely
   interrelated with the land's topography (e. g., hills, valleys,
   elevation), which also influences malaria risk strongly. Parsing the
   individual contributions of land-cover/land-use variables to malaria
   risk requires examining these associations in the context of their
   topographic landscape. This study examined whether environmental factors
   like land-cover, land-use, and urban density improved malaria risk
   prediction based solely on the topographically-determined context, as
   measured by the topographic wetness index.
   Methods: The topographic wetness index, an estimate of predicted water
   accumulation in a defined area, was generated from a digital terrain
   model of the landscape surrounding households in two neighbouring
   western Kenyan highland communities. Variables determined to best
   encompass the variance in this topographic wetness surface were
   calculated at a household level. Land-cover/land-use information was
   extracted from a high-resolution satellite image using an object-based
   classification method. Topographic and land-cover variables were used
   individually and in combination to predict household-level malaria in
   the communities through an iterative split-sample model fitting and
   testing procedure. Models with only topographic variables were compared
   to those with additional predictive factors related to
   land-cover/land-use to investigate whether these environmental factors
   improved prediction of malaria based on the shape of the land alone.
   Results: Variables related to topographic wetness proved most useful in
   predicting the households of individuals contracting malaria in this
   region of rugged terrain. Other variables related to human modification
   of the environment also demonstrated clear associations with household
   malaria. However, these land-cover/land-use variables failed to produce
   unambiguous improvements in statistical predictive models controlling
   for important topographic factors, with none improving prediction of
   household-level malaria more than 75\% of the time.
   Conclusions: Topographic wetness values in this region of highly varied
   terrain more accurately predicted houses at greater risk of malaria than
   did consideration of land-cover/land-use characteristics. As such, those
   planning control or local elimination strategies in similar highland
   regions may use topographic and geographic characteristics to
   effectively identify high-receptivity regions that may require enhanced
   vigilance.},

Title = {Radar imaging mechanism of marine sand waves at very low grazing angle
   illumination caused by unique hydrodynamic interactions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {111},
Number = {C10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {{[}1] The investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004 during six
   field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in
   monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for
   coastal management (OROMA) project aimed to improve the effectiveness of
   new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as shipborne imaging
   radars in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS
   Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, is based on a Kelvin Hughes RSR
   1000 X band (9.42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was
   mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the
   experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the
   North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the
   availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of
   the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular
   scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction
   theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have
   been taken at very low grazing angles <= 2.6 degrees of flood and ebb
   tide-oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal
   current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest <=
   0.6 m s(-1) have been measured at wind speeds <= 4.5 m s(-1) and water
   depths <= 25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and
   simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb
   tide-oriented sand wave is 27\%. For the flood tide-oriented sand wave,
   a difference of 21\% has been calculated. The difference between the
   minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide-oriented
   sand wave is 10\%, and for the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a value of
   43\% has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations
   correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated
   NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always
   quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the
   quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a
   first-order theory.},

Title = {Assessing spatiotemporal variations of forest carbon density using
   bi-temporal discrete aerial laser scanning data in Chinese boreal
   forests},
Journal = {FOREST ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Assessing the changes in forest carbon stocks over time is critical for
   monitoring carbon dynamics, estimating the balance between carbon uptake
   and release from forests, and providing key insights into climate change
   mitigation. In this study, we quantitatively characterized
   spatiotemporal variations in aboveground carbon density (ACD) in boreal
   natural forests in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) region using
   bi-temporal discrete aerial laser scanning (ALS) data acquired in 2012
   and 2016. Moreover, we evaluated the transferability of the proposed
   design model using forest field plot data and produced a wall-to-wall
   map of ACD changes for the entire study area from 2012 to 2016 at a grid
   size of 30 m. In addition, we investigated the relationships between
   carbon dynamics and the dominant tree species, age groups, and
   topography of undisturbed forested areas to better understand ACD
   variations by employing heterogeneous forest canopy structural
   characteristics. The results showed that the performance of the
   temporally transferable model (R2 = 0.87, rRMSE = 18.25\%), which
   included stable variables, was statistically equivalent to that obtained
   from the model fitted directly by the 2016 field plots (R2 = 0.87, rRMSE
   = 17.47\%). The average rate of change in carbon sequestration across
   the entire study region was 1.35 Mg center dot ha 1 center dot year 1
   based on the changes in ALS-based ACD values over the course of four
   years. The relative change rates of ACD decreased as the elevation
   increased, with the highest and lowest ACD growth rates occurring in the
   middle-aged and mature forest stands, respectively. The Gini
   coefficient, which represents forest canopy surface structure
   heterogeneity, is sensitive to carbon dynamics and is a reliable
   predictor of the relative change rate of ACD. This study demonstrated
   the applicability of bi-temporal ALS for predicting forest carbon
   dynamics and fine-scale spatial change patterns. Our research
   contributed to a better understanding of the influence of remote
   sensing-derived environmental variables on forest carbon dynamic
   patterns and the development of context-specific management approaches
   to increase forest carbon stocks.},

Abstract = {GolMexSur, a metadatabase for the oceanographic and meteorological
   information of the southern Gulf of Mexico (SGM) (17N 85W - 26N 99W) was
   designed and implemented in order to organize and manage in a fine and
   regular mesh, oceanic and meteorological data coming from several
   heterogeneous gross-grid-sized or sparse data sources. The metadatabase
   has three organizational components: (1) knowledge base, (2) metadata,
   and (3) data values. Knowledge base component contains three classes of
   knowledge: operating knowledge (triggers, processes, and integrity
   constraints), control knowledge for sequential systems interactions, and
   decision knowledge for parallel systems interactions. Metadata component
   contains organizational information related to the environmental and
   hydrological data: data's spatial and temporal location, measurement
   units, obtaining method, quality, etc. Finally, data values component
   represents the numerical value of each variable or parameter (sea
   surface temperature, wind speed, wind direction, sea level pressure,
   etc). Additionally, metadata and data values components have two
   temporal scopes: recent information, and historical information.
   GolMexSur has information from sources such as coastal airports, coastal
   meteorological stations, oceanographic cruises, buoys, wave gauges, and
   information derived or estimated from satellite imageries or numerical
   models. In a first stage, GolMexSur was designed and implemented using
   MS Visual FoxPro(@), but recently the design was modified to work with
   Oracle(@). The implementation of this metadatabase represents the first
   step of a major project, whose main objective is to build a regional
   operational oceanographic system for the SGM, and at present it is being
   used in studying the oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the SGM oil
   region.},

Title = {Assessing the Potential of Rural Settlement Land Consolidation in China:
   A Method Based on Comprehensive Evaluation of Restricted Factors},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rural settlement land consolidation potential calculation is the basic
   work of land consolidation. An accurate potential is essential to rural
   development planners and policy makers as a project target or
   prediction. The traditional calculation methods include the per
   capita/household construction land method, idle rural residential land
   method, and comprehensive evaluation method. Though there have been some
   improvements, the potential for calculation methods on a national level
   is still limited. This article illustrates a new method for calculating
   the consolidation potential of rural settlement land, based on field
   data and the restructuring restrictions applicable to each rural land
   parcel in China. The field data was from Shandong Province because it
   lies within the country's biggest grain-producing area with the largest
   distribution density of rural settlements. It is an excellent
   representative sample for rural settlement land consolidation, offering
   a microcosm of rural development in China. For the study's comprehensive
   evaluation system, due to the lack of nationwide field survey data, the
   potential of Shandong Province was chosen as the standard value. We
   selected indicators concerning land resources, depopulation,
   transportation accessibility, local economic development, urbanization,
   and natural conditions to build an evaluation system. We then calculated
   the potential of each province according to their coefficients and field
   data from Shandong Province. Every province except Taiwan (for which no
   data were available) was divided into five zones for rural settlement
   land consolidation: the most-suitable zone, suitable zone, general zone,
   restricted zone, and most-restricted zone. The total rate of land
   consolidation is estimated at 0.24 for 2010 and forecast at 0.33 for
   2020, while those years' respective consolidation potentials are
   32,777.92 km(2) and 44,707.81 km(2). The rate is the total rural
   settlement land before land consolidation divided by added cultivated
   land after consolidation. The higher the rate, more effective the land
   consolidation is.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline changes and future forecasting:
   the case of Kucuk Menderes Delta, Turkiye},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {A delta coastal area is one of the most important regions for human use
   owing to its scenic natural beauty and economic value. However, due to
   the constant interaction between the land and water environments in this
   region, it is also one of the most rapidly changing landforms in the
   world under the impact of natural processes as well as anthropogenic
   activities. Therefore, the determination and the constant monitoring of
   these changes spatiotemporally are of great significance in terms of the
   protection, planning, proper usage, effective management, and
   sustainability of the delta coast. In this study was aimed to determine
   the short-term and long-term shoreline changes that occurred between the
   years 1957 and 2020 along the coast of the Kucuk Menderes Delta and its
   close surroundings. In addition, the underlying causes were explored,
   and the future of the shoreline position was forecasted. The shorelines
   were digitized using seven multi-temporal orthophoto maps based on the
   high water line indicator. The shoreline changes were analyzed using
   different statistical methods, namely, the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM),
   Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear
   Regression Rate (LRR), by employing the Digital Shoreline Analysis
   System (DSAS). The future position of the shoreline was estimated using
   the extended Kalman Filter in the DSAS. The analyses revealed that in a
   period of 63 years, the maximum accretion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR
   and LRR) were 248.99 m, 3.96 m/year, and 3.65 m/year, respectively, the
   maximum erosion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR and LRR) were - 142.37 m,
   - 2.27 m/year, and - 2.19 m/year, respectively, and the delta coastal
   area had increased by 37.01 ha. It is forecasted that the delta coastal
   area will expand by 10.63 ha and 16.16 ha from 2020 to 2030 and 2040. If
   the current conditions that occurred in the last 63 years continue with
   similar effects, it was forecasted that by the years 2030 and 2040,
   significant changes would occur in the shoreline such as retreat into
   the existing facilities/usage areas and decrease of Eleman Wetland area,
   which would greatly alter the ecology, hydrography, and spatial usage of
   the delta region.},

Title = {Use of the pediatric symptom checklist to screen for psychosocial
   problems in pediatric primary care - A national feasibility study},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS \& ADOLESCENT MEDICINE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {153},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Routine use of a brief psychosocial screening instrument has
   been proposed as a means of improving recognition, management, and
   referral of children's psychosocial morbidity in primary care.
   Objective: To assess the feasibility of routine psychosocial screening
   using the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) in pediatrics by using a
   brief version of the checklist in a large sample representative of the
   full range of pediatric practice settings in the United States and
   Canada. We evaluated large-scale screening and the performance of the
   PSC in detecting psychosocial problems by (1) determining whether the
   prevalence of psychosocial dysfunction identified by the PSC was
   consistent with findings in previous, smaller samples; (2) assessing
   whether the prevalence of positive PSC screening stores varied by
   population subgroups; and (3) determining whether the PSC was completed
   by a significant proportion of parents from all subgroups and settings.
   Patients and Methods: Twenty-one thousand sixty-five children between
   the ages of 4 and 15 years were seen in 2 large primary care networks:
   the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network and the Pediatric Research in
   Office Settings network, involving 395 pediatric and family practice
   clinicians in et states, Puerto Rico, and 4 Canadian provinces. Parents
   were asked to complete a brief questionnaire that included demographic
   information, history of mental health services, the 35-item PSC, and the
   number of pediatric visits within the past 6 months.
   Results: The overall prevalence rates of psychosocial dysfunction as
   measured by the PSC in school-aged and preschool-aged pediatric
   outpatients (13\% and 10\%, respectively) were nearly identical to the
   rates that had been reported in several smaller samples (12\%-14\% among
   school-aged children and 7\%-14\% among preschoolers). Consistent with
   previous findings, children from low-income families were twice as
   likely to be scored as dysfunctional on the PSC than were children from
   higher-income families. Similarly, children from single-parent as
   opposed to those from 2-parent families and children with a past history
   of mental health services showed an elevated risk of psychosocial
   impairment. The current study was the first to demonstrate a 50\%
   increase in risk of impairment for male children. The overall rate of
   completed forms was 97\%, well within an acceptable range, and at least
   94\% of the parents in each sociodemograghic subgroup completed the PSC
   form.
   Conclusions: Use of the PSC offers an approach to the recognition of
   psychosocial dysfunction that is sufficiently consistent across groups
   and locales to become part of comprehensive pediatric care in virtually
   all outpatient settings. In addition to its clinical utility, the
   consistency and widespread acceptability of the PSC make it well suited
   for the next generation of pediatric mental health services research,
   which can address whether earlier recognition of and intervention for
   psychosocial problems in pediatrics will lead to cost-effective
   outcomes.},

Title = {Optimization and assessment of phytoplankton size class algorithms for
   ocean color data on the Northeast US continental shelf},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {267},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The size structure of phytoplankton communities influences important
   ecological and biogeochemical processes, including the transfer of
   energy through marine food webs. A variety of algorithms have been
   developed to estimate phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from satellite
   ocean color data. However, many of these algorithms were developed for
   application to the global ocean, and their performance in more
   productive, optically complex coastal and continental shelf regions
   warrants evaluation. In this study, several existing PSC models were
   applied in the Northeast U.S. continental shelf (NES) region and
   compared with in situ PSC estimates derived from a local HPLC pigment
   data set. The effect of regional re-parameterization and incorporation
   of sea surface temperature (SST) into existing abundance-based model
   frameworks was investigated and model performance was assessed using an
   independent data set. Abundance-based model re-parameterization alone
   did not result in significant improvement in model performance compared
   with other models. However, the inclusion of SST led to a consistent
   reduction in model error for all size classes. Of two absorption-based
   algorithms tested, the best performing approach displayed similar
   performance metrics to the regional SST-dependent abundance-based model.
   The SST-dependent model and the absorption-based method were applied to
   monthly composites of the NES region for April and September 2019 and
   qualitatively compared. The results highlight the benefit of considering
   SST in abundance-based models and the applicability of absorption-based
   PSC methods in optically complex regions.},

Journal = {EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL},

Volume = {37},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Introduction/background Accurate prehospital identification of patients
   who had an acute stroke enables rapid conveyance to specialist units for
   time-dependent treatments such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy.
   Misidentification leads to patients who had a `stroke mimic' (SM) being
   inappropriately triaged to specialist units. We evaluated the positive
   predictive value (PPV) of prehospital stroke identification by ambulance
   clinicians in the North East of England. Methods This service evaluation
   linked routinely collected records from a UK regional ambulance service
   identifying adults with any clinical impression of suspected stroke to
   diagnostic data from four National Health Service hospital trusts
   between 1 June 2013 and 31 May 2016. The reference standard for a
   confirmed stroke diagnosis was inclusion in Sentinel Stroke National
   Audit Programme data or a hospital diagnosis of stroke or transient
   ischaemic attack in Hospital Episode Statistics. PPV was calculated as a
   measure of diagnostic accuracy. Results Ambulance clinicians in North
   East England identified 5645 patients who had a suspected stroke (mean
   age 73.2 years, 48\% male). At least one Face Arm Speech Test (FAST)
   symptom was documented for 93\% of patients who had a suspected stroke
   but a positive FAST was only documented for 51\%. Stroke, or transient
   ischaemic attack, was the final diagnosis for 3483 (62\%) patients. SM
   (false positives) accounted for 38\% of suspected strokes identified by
   ambulance clinicians and included a wide range of non-stroke diagnoses
   including infections, seizures and migraine. Discussion In this large
   multisite data set, identification of patients who had a stroke by
   ambulance clinicians had a PPV rate of 62\% (95\% CI 61 to 63). Most
   patients who had a suspected stroke had at least one FAST symptom, but
   failure to document a complete test was common. Training for stroke
   identification and SM rates need to be considered when planning service
   provision and capacity.},

Title = {Comparing machine learning with case-control models to identify
   confirmed dengue cases},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the global incidence of dengue has increased.
   Affected countries have responded with more effective surveillance
   strategies to detect outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement
   prevention and control measures. We have applied newly developed machine
   learning approaches to identify laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from
   4,894 emergency department patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who
   received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11\% (2942 cases) were
   confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables {[}age, body
   temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only
   the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but
   also the conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR)
   models delivered performances with receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curves areas under curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75\% to
   85.87\% {[}for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60\% +/- 0.03\%, 85.87\% +/- 0.54\%,
   83.75\% +/- 0.17\%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses found all the
   models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period.
   Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6\%, 92.9\%, and 93.1\% in
   DT, DNN, and LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for
   low WBCs {[}<= 3.2 (x10(3)/mu L)], fever (>= 38 degrees C), low platelet
   counts {[}< 100 (x10(3)/mu L)], and elderly (>= 65 years) were 5.17
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 3.96-6.76], 3.17 {[}95\%CI:
   2.74-3.66], 3.10 {[}95\%CI: 2.44-3.94], and 1.77 {[}95\%CI: 1.50-2.10],
   respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor
   countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be
   applied for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue
   cases and even be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for
   early warning and immediate prevention/control measures. In other words,
   a local community hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood
   counts (including platelets) can provide a sentinel screening during
   outbreaks. In conclusion, the machine learning approach can facilitate
   medical and public health efforts to minimize the health threat of
   dengue epidemics. However, laboratory confirmation remains the primary
   goal of surveillance and outbreak investigation.
   Author summary
   Identifying dengue cases early is crucial but challenging for healthcare
   professionals. This challenge is increased during large epidemics and is
   a particular problem in non-endemic areas with limited experienced
   staff. To improve dengue diagnosis, we investigated how to exploit
   machine learning (ML)-based prediction models and identified four key
   variables {[}age, fever, white blood cell counts (WBCs), and platelet
   counts], which are compatible with clinical and epidemiological
   knowledge. With these variables, the ML prediction models {[}decision
   tree (DT), deep neural network (DNN)] and the logistic regression model
   developed for identifying laboratory-confirmed dengue cases produced
   areas under curve (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curves ranging from 83.75\% to 85.87\%. This implies that the prediction
   models may serve as a pivotal component of an integrated dengue
   surveillance system and they required only a single complete blood count
   (CBC) examination. The sensitivities, positive prediction values, and
   accuracies for major risk factors in the two machine learning models
   were close to those of the regression models. For future applications,
   the DNN models with superior performance can be employed at epidemic
   sites with adequate computer facilities, while the DT and regression
   models with interpretable prediction logic can be employed at sites with
   limited or no computer facilities. Artificial intelligence and clinical
   parameters identified from this study may aid when laboratories are
   overwhelmed, but should never replace laboratory confirmation.},

Abstract = {Maps of coral ecosystems are needed to Support many conservation and
   management objectives, as well as research activities. Examples include
   ground-truthing aerial and satellite imagery, characterizing essential
   habitat, assessing changes, and monitoring the progress of restoration
   efforts. To address some of these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey
   developed the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based
   sensor package for mapping shallow-water bcnthic environments. ATRIS
   consists of a digital still camera, a video camera, and an acoustic
   depth sounder affixed to a moveable pole. This design, however,
   restricts its deployment to clear waters less than 10 in deep. To
   overcome this limitation, a towed version has been developed, referred
   to as Deep ATRIS. The system is based on a light-weight,
   computer-control led, towed vehicle that is capable of following a
   programmed diving profile. The vehicle is 1.3 in long with a 63-cm wing
   span and can carry a wide variety of research instruments, including
   CTDs, fluorometers, transmissometers, and cameras. Deep ATRIS is
   currently equipped with a high-speed (20 frames s(-1)) digital camera,
   custom-built light-emitting-diode lights, a compass, a 3-axis
   orientation sensor, and a nadir-looking altimeter. The vehicle
   dynamically adjusts its altitude to maintain a fixed height above the
   seafloor. The camera has a 29 degrees x 22 degrees field-of-view and
   captures color images that are 1360 x 1024 pixels in size. GPS
   coordinates are recorded for each image. A gigabit ethernet connection
   enables the images to be displayed and archived in real time on the
   surface computer. Deep ATRIS has a maximum tow speed of 2.6 in s(-1) and
   a theoretical operating tow-depth limit of 27 in. With an improved tow
   cable, the operating depth can be extended to 90 in. Here, we present
   results from the initial sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico and Biscayne
   National Park, Florida, USA, and discuss the utility of Deep ATRIS for
   mapping coral reef habitats, Several example mosaics illustrate the
   high-quality imagery that can be obtained with this system. The images
   also reveal the potential for unobtrusive animal observations; fish and
   sea turtles are unperturbed by the presence of Deep ATRIS. Rev. Biol.

Title = {Trophic status of a coastal lagoon-marine harbor system: Potential
   outwelling rates to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef southern region},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {880},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Eutrophication is still a serious problem in many coastal areas,
   including the tropics, where river discharges of nutrients is usually
   high. The ecological stability and ecosystem services of the
   Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS), the world's second-largest
   coral reef system, suffer a generalized impact by riverine discharge of
   sediment and organic and inorganic nutrients, which may lead to coastal
   eutrophication and a coral-macroalgal phase shift. However, few data
   exist on the MRBS coastal zone status, particularly in Honduras. Here,
   two in situ sampling campaigns were carried out (May 2017 and January
   2018) in the Alvarado Lagoon and Puerto Cortes Bay (Honduras).
   Measurements included water column nutrients, chlorophyll-a (Chla),
   particulate organic and inorganic matter and net community metabolism,
   completed with satellite images analysis. The lagoon and bay
   environments are ecologically different systems and present different
   sensitivities to seasonal changes in precipitation as shown by the
   multivariate analysis. Nonetheless, net community production and
   respiration rates were neither different spatially, nor seasonally. In
   addition, both environments were highly eutrophic as shown by the TRIX
   index. Thus, the Puerto Cortes system represents an important source of
   dissolved nutrients and particulate matter to the coastal zone. Even
   though offshore, water quality, based on estimated outwelling rates from
   the Puerto Cortes system to the coastal waters of the southern MRBS
   region, improved considerably, concentrations of Chla and nutrients
   remained higher than those typically measured in non-polluted coral
   reefs in the Caribbean region and the suggested threshold values. In
   situ monitoring and assessment of these aspects are crucial to evaluate
   the ecological functioning of and threats on the MBRS, and elaborate and
   implement adequate policies for integrated management given its regional
   and global importance.},

Title = {Predicting numbers of hauled-out harbour seals: a mathematical model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-117},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. It was once assumed that commercially important fish make up
   significant portions of seal diets. As a consequence, prior to the 1970s
   many seal populations were dramatically reduced by rampant slaughtering.
   Today, seals and other marine mammals are valued components of marine
   ecosystems and their numbers are carefully managed. To facilitate
   management, government statutes mandate the systematic monitoring of
   seal populations. Population estimates are based on counts of hauled-out
   seals obtained by aerial survey and radio and satellite telemetry;
   hence, considerable effort has been devoted to finding optimal times for
   such counts. We have developed a predictive mathematical model of seal
   haul-out to assist resource managers in the selection of optimal census
   times.
   2. Haul-out depends on a number of environmental variables. Some of
   these variables, such as wind speed, can be obtained only as historical
   data or short-range predictions. Others, such as tide height, are
   deterministic and can be obtained as long-range predictions.
   3. We used deterministic environmental variables to develop mathematical
   models that describe haul-out dynamics of harbour seals Phoca vitulina
   during the pupping season at a site in Washington, USA. A list of
   alternative hypotheses for environmental cues gave rise to a suite of
   competing models. We used information-theoretic model selection
   techniques to choose the best model. The selected model was a function
   of tide height and current direction, and explained 40\% of the
   variability in hourly census data.
   4. An assumption that the system recovers rapidly after disturbance
   introduced two time scales. This allowed the differential equation model
   to be reduced to an algebraic equation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that resource
   managers can use a simple algebraic equation based on deterministic
   environmental variables to predict times at which to census maximal
   haul-out in harbour seals. At the Washington site, maximal daily
   haul-outs during pupping season are predicted to occur during receding
   tides, approximately midway between high and low tides. The largest
   maximal daily haul-outs during the pupping season are predicted to occur
   in the last week of July. The environmental factors correlated with
   haul-out are, however, site-specific; therefore the model developed for
   the Washington site will not necessarily hold for other haul-out areas.
   Managers should carry out the model selection procedure separately for
   each monitored haul-out site. The general methodology employed in this
   study can be used to make long-range predictions of diurnal movements
   for a variety of marine birds and mammals.},

Abstract = {The London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study, a prospective,
   comparative, nonrandomized study, directly compared outcomes of
   quotidian (daily) hemodialysis patients with conventional thrice-weekly
   hemodialysis patients. Patients were assigned to either daily
   (short-hours) hemodialysis (n = 11) or nocturnal hemodialysis (n = 12)
   and followed up for 5-36 months; all data were directly compared with
   matched control patients receiving conventional hemodialysis (n = 22).
   Outcomes evaluated were adequacy (urea kinetics), nutrition, anemia
   management, blood pressure and volume control, calcium/phosphorus
   control, and patient quality of life. In addition, a detailed economic
   analysis was undertaken. The study showed that both quotidian
   hemodialysis regimens are more effective than conventional hemodialysis
   in improving weekly urea clearance. Significant clinical improvements
   were seen with quotidian therapy in the areas of nutrition (short-hours
   daily), blood pressure (both), volume control (short-hours daily),
   calcium/phosphorus control (nocturnal), and quality of life (both). A
   nonsignificant trend for improvement in anemia management was suggested.
   The economic analysis showed substantial savings in annualized cost per
   quality-adjusted life-year in changing from conventional hemodialysis
   (carried out in-center, in satellite units, or at home) to home
   quotidian hemodialysis. The substantial clinical benefits of home
   quotidian hemodialysis, combined with the economic advantage shown by
   this study, clearly justify its expansion. (The details of this study
   have recently been published in 11 articles in the American Journal of
   Kidney Diseases{[}2003;42(suppl 1)].},

Abstract = {Wetlands are crucial ecosystems with multiple values and functions to a
   range of different stakeholders. The future of wetlands depends both on
   the legacy of the past and how they are currently used. Using 48
   vegetation survey plots (0.08ha) combined with Landsat 5 and 7 TM
   imagery, we assessed the influence of long-term (1990-2011) land use and
   land cover change on the biodiversity of the Kibasira Swamp. Information
   on perceptions of adjacent communities on historical changes and drivers
   for the changes were also collected. Results showed an increase in the
   area covered by open water by 1\% and forest by 4\% between 1990 and
   1998 whilst Cyperus papyrus L and cultivated land area decreased by 8\%
   and 3\%, respectively on the same period. Between 1998 and 2011, there
   was a decrease in areas covered by water by 35\% and forest by 9\%
   whereas C. papyrus L increased by 40\% and cultivated land increased by
   8\%. These changes have affected the biodiversity of the swamp and
   adjacent to it as numbers of mammals have declined. However, the Swamp
   still provides extensive habitat for plants and bird species despite the
   ongoing human pressure. Interventions may be necessary to maintain
   biodiversity in Kibasira Swamp to ensure sustainable ecosystem services.

Title = {Evaluation of Forecast Reference Evapotranspiration for Different
   Microclimate Regions in California to Enable Prospective Irrigation
   Scheduling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {California, daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is commonly estimated
   using near-real-time, standardized reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
   calculated from ground-based meteorological data and crop coefficient
   (Kc) values that adjust for the difference between ETo and ETc. However,
   using ETo calculated from forecast rather than near-real-time
   meteorological data provides more timely information to growers, farm
   managers, urban water users, irrigation practitioners, and water
   purveyors to anticipate water demand for the upcoming days. This is
   particularly important for water allocation and delivery planning and
   for irrigation scheduling decisions. Forecast ETo is also relevant for
   scientific research for developing methods and tools enabling more
   resource-efficient water use for agricultural production and urban
   landscapes. Verifying the reliability of ETo forecast models for various
   climatic conditions is crucial for promoting the broad adoption and use
   of ETo predictions for weather-based adaptive water management and
   prospective irrigation scheduling. The US National Weather Service (NWS)
   has released a product called forecast reference evapotranspiration
   (FRET) that provides ETo forecasts at a 2.5-km grid resolution for the
   entire continental US. In this study, comparisons were made between ETo
   forecasts from FRET and observed ETo values from the California
   Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) for a total of 78 days
   during the peak irrigation water demand period of 2019, which
   corresponded to the midseason period for major crops. FRET ETo forecasts
   and CIMIS ETo observations (calculated from measured weather parameters)
   were compared for 15 CIMIS station locations to represent a variety of
   weather conditions of some major agricultural production and urban areas
   in California. Air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, and
   solar radiation data were collected from NWS and CIMIS and analyzed to
   assess the accuracy of predicted weather variables and FRET ETo
   forecasts. The FRET data consisted of 1, 3, 5, and 7-day forecasts of
   weather parameters and calculated ETo values; these were compared with
   the corresponding observed daily weather and ETo data from CIMIS in
   order to statistically evaluate FRET performance. The comparison among
   forecast and measured weather variables revealed a good match for
   maximum air temperature (R-2 between 0.98 and 1.00), minimum air
   temperature (R-2 > 0.91), dew point temperature (R-2 between 0.7 and
   1.00), and wind speed (R-2 between 0.66 and 0.99); less accurate results
   were obtained for solar radiation (R-2 between 0.21 and 0.87). The
   analysis also showed a good correlation between FRET ETo forecast data
   and observed CIMIS ETo data (R-2 between 0.93 and 1.00 and root mean
   square error (RMSE) was less than 1 mm . day(-1)) for the majority of
   the selected stations, with some differences that were likely due to the
   climatic conditions of specific locations. This suggests that FRET ETo
   forecasts provide reliable information for predicting near-future water
   demand and improving irrigation water management in California. The
   comparisons showed a good match for most of the 15 CIMIS stations, and
   the FRET model may potentially provide accurate ETo forecasts in similar
   semiarid and subhumid areas elsewhere.
   Weekly irrigation schedule examples are provided in the Appendix to
   illustrate the use of FRET ETo forecasts in combination with
   site-specific information on soil hydraulic properties and irrigation
   system performance for prospective irrigation scheduling of some
   specialty crops and urban landscapes. The information provided in this
   article can help improve the water management efficiency of
   high-frequency agricultural irrigation systems and urban sprinkler
   systems in California and other locations with similar climates. It also
   offers a less expensive method to obtain ETo data in countries that do
   not have ETo station networks, because it offers an alternative to
   installing and maintaining ETo stations in agricultural and urban areas
   where it is difficult to find acceptable surfaces for developing
   reliable ETo information. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Universities and business schools across the world are addressing the
   topic of inclusion primarily via financial barriers. MOOCs, Coursera and
   other buzzwords are the hot topics of the day. Participants around the
   world certainly benefit from lowering financial hurdles. Yet, from our
   experience, the contribution of MOOCs to increasing skill levels in
   developing and emerging countries is severely constrained by
   technological boundaries.
   Many prospective students of E-Learning in Africa, Asia, Latin America
   and the Pacific Islands incur substantial challenges. In many countries,
   internet is only available from satellite connection, and it is
   expensive and slow. Fibre optic cables are not the norm in Central
   Africa or in the Pacific Islands. This implies that fancy web based
   trainings and sophisticated interactive modules will simply ``time
   out{''}.
   Yet it is exactly those prospective students of E-Learning in emerging
   and developing countries who stand to benefit most -after all the
   quality of local universities and business schools offering professional
   trainings may not always be up to international standards. Access to
   international best practice E-Learning would be a superb way to let the
   participants catch up.
   To address this problem, Frankfurt School of Finance \& Management
   (Frankfurt School) developed the highly innovative, technologically
   highly accessible LinkEd platform to provide affordable part-time
   training opportunities to international development finance
   practitioners, eager for education but often hampered by the limited
   access to it. But how is it possible to combine high quality online
   education with low technical and infrastructural requirements? The
   LinkEd strategy is to mix modern and traditional online learning
   approaches allowing participants with and without high speed internet to
   follow the courses.
   Provide education and training opportunities for developing and
   developed countries
   Provide highly specialized and relevant knowledge on development finance
   Offer affordable and flexible six-month courses
   Constant development and improvement of the e-learning tools
   Offer an international network of partner institutions hosting the final
   examination, giving the participants the possibility to receive a
   Frankfurt School Certification
   In 2010, the pilot of the first ``Certified Expert in Microfinance{''}
   (CEMF) was launched in India and became international one year later.
   With its international setup, the CEMF course has been offered for the
   fifth time starting September 2013. In 2012, the ``Certified Expert in
   SME Finance{''} started and in 2013 the ``Certified Expert in Risk
   Management{''} was added to the portfolio. Since its beginning, the
   LinkEd portfolio has been expanding and until today (10/2013) the
   concept has attracted around 900 participants from more than 100
   different countries. However that was not enough, in March 2014 the
   Frankfurt School will launch a new course on Climate and Renewable
   Energy Finance.
   Summarizing, what makes LinkEd successful? The fact that we offer an
   alternative and affordable way of education to participants from all
   over the world. The fact that we offer the flexibility to learn along
   side of a full time job. The fact that high qualified trainers and
   experts develop and support the courses. The key factor of the success
   is to link all of this into one concept: LinkEd},

Title = {Structural-optimized sequential deep learning methods for surface soil
   moisture forecasting, case study Quebec, Canada},

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (M-SS) is a key factor governing environmental
   interactions in any catchment. Energy flux between soil and atmosphere,
   soil temperature, and heat diffusion in soil are examples of impressible
   interactions. Consequently, the agriculture sector and its many
   dependent industries are influenced by this element. Hence,
   investigating new optimized preprocessing and input selection methods
   for processing, interpretation, modeling, and prediction of M-SS is
   necessary to ensure sustainable agriculture. To this end, satellite
   products were studied for the province of Quebec, Canada. Two overall
   deep learning (DL) approaches are proposed in this study. The first and
   most efficient one is extracting meaningful modeling parameters by the
   time-series structural-analysis-based method, and the second one is
   using the combination of optimization algorithms and the DL method. The
   structure of the extracted time series from satellite data was assessed
   by several tests and an intense periodic pattern was detected.
   Therefore, additive Holt-Winter's (S-HW), seasonal standardization
   (S-std), and spectral analysis (S-A) were chosen as preprocessing
   methods for the structural analysis preprocessing. The long short-term
   memory (LSTM) model was utilized for short-term forecasting of
   un-preprocessed and preprocessed M-SS datasets. Along with
   structural-analysis-based methodology, genetic and teacher-learner-based
   algorithms (GA and T(L)A) were coupled with LSTM to assess the coupled
   models' performance for M-SS forecasting for the first time. Based on
   the structural analysis of data, limited hidden states (h(t)) were
   selected for modeling \{1, 2, 7, 9, 52\}: network training and forecasts
   were undertaken according to these hidden states. Since the long-term
   characteristics of the time series like trend and level are not
   significant in short-term modeling, the LSTM (S-std, 9), correlation
   coefficient (R) = 0.970, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.339
   outperformed other models, followed closely by LSTM (S-HW, 1), R =
   0.922, RMSE = 1.958. Conversely, for long-term forecast, as these
   attributes impact the structure, LSTM (S-HW, 2), R = 0.922, RMSE =
   0.1961 was more successful in the prediction of patterns and
   fluctuations, followed by LSTM (S-std, 52), R = 0.920, RMSE = 2.064,
   which was more complicated than the model developed for short-term
   modeling. GA-LSTM (h(t) = 32, R = 0.930, RMSE = 1.852) and T(L)A-LSTM
   (h(t) = 37, R = 0.934, RMSE = 1.781) also enhanced the long-term
   forecasting results. Integration of these two optimization methods had
   two benefits. First, due to the stochastic nature of optimization
   algorithms and DL methods, the search space for the optimized parameter
   (h(t)) was greatly increased and many possibilities were investigated.
   Second, the LSTM could perform a long-term forecast of the M-SS without
   preprocessing, which was not possible by structural analysis. On the
   other hand, these methods were much computationally expensive and the
   combination of their controlling parameters with other controlling
   parameters of LSTM created numerous possibilities. However, as TLA is
   parameter free and much less sophisticated than GA, it is a more
   computational-effective method, and subsequently a better option than
   GA.},

Abstract = {Around the world, vast improvements in public transportation methods in
   urban environments have been made. However, in densely populated areas,
   the bicycle remains a very useful means of transportation. Its small
   size and minimal environmental impact are the critical factors that
   maintain its relevance. Moreover, the advancement of connected devices
   and sharing-based services have allowed private vendors to develop
   bike-sharing programs, giving millions access to bike transportation
   around the globe. These bike-sharing programs rely on the user to check
   out and return the bike to a designated bike-holding station. With the
   growth of Internet of Things (IoT) services and wirelessly connected
   devices, there is a major benefit in enabling vendors to track their
   bicycle assets. Satellite navigation has come a long way, however, it
   requires a large power overhead. This paper proposes an energy-efficient
   bicycle tracking system that utilizes bicycle powered Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BLE) beacons and Long Range (LoRa) type base-stations in order
   to track and maintain a real-time location-based inventory of all
   assets. The BLE beacons are used to track individual bicycle assets
   based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) proximity and the
   LoRa base stations exploit longer range communication capabilities to
   transmit asset location information between each other, for added
   management capabilities. Preliminary proximity estimations using BLE
   beacons in an urban outdoor environment show promising results with
   proximity accuracy consistently under 2 meters.},

Abstract = {Indonesia's fire and haze problem is increasingly being ascribed to
   large-scale forest conversion and land clearing activities making way
   for pulpwood, rubber and oil palm plantations. Fire is the cheapest tool
   available to small holders and plantation owners to reduce vegetation
   cover and prepare and fertilize extremely poor soils. Fires that escaped
   from agricultural bums have ravaged East Kalimantan forests on the
   island of Borneo during extreme drought periods in 1982-1983, 1987,
   1991, 1994 and 1997-1998. Estimates based on satellite data and ground
   observations are that more than five million hectares were burned in
   East Kalimantan during the 1997/1998 dry season. Not only were the
   economic losses and ecological damage from these surface fires enormous,
   they ignited coal seams exposed at the ground surface along their
   outcrops. Coal fires now threaten Indonesia's shrinking ecological
   resources in Kutai National Park and Sungai Wain Nature Reserve. Sungai
   Wain has one of the last areas of unburned primary rainforest in the
   Balikpapan-Samarinda area with an extremely rich biodiversity. Although
   fires in 1997/1998 damaged nearly 50\% of this Reserve and ignited 76
   coal fires, it remains the most valuable water catchment area in the
   region and it has been used as a reintroduction site for the endangered
   orangutan. The Office of Surface Mining provided Indonesia with the
   capability to take quick action on coal fires that presented threats to
   public health and safety, infrastructure or the environment. The US
   Department of State's Southeast Asia Environmental Protection Initiative
   through the US Agency for International Development funded the project.
   Technical assistance and training transferred skills in coal fire
   management through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resource's
   Training Agency to the regional offices; giving the regions the
   long-term capability to manage coal fires. Funding was also included to
   extinguish coal fires as demonstrations to the Indonesian Government.
   Successful demonstrations obtained visible benefits for a large number
   of local interests and received overwhelmingly favorable public
   response. This built the public and political support needed to continue
   this work. These successes encouraged the Ministry to officially assume
   the responsibility for coal fire management by Decree 1539/20/ MPE/1999.
   The Ministry reallocated internal funds to support portions of the
   immediate suppression projects and committed a portion of the Coal
   Royalty Fund to provide long-term support for coal fire suppression
   activities. Coal fires continue to present a serious risk to Indonesia's
   ecosystems, population and forest resources. The Ministry and local
   governments in East Kalimantan are still working on the coal fire
   inventory. It presently contains 164 coal fires, but it is far from
   complete. Unless these coal fires are managed or extinguished, they will
   add to the already catastrophic cycle of anthropogenic forest fires that
   further reduce Indonesia's forest resources and endangered species while
   contributing unnecessarily to global carbon emissions. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices improves
   device surveillance and patient clinical management. The greatest
   challenge in implementing remote monitoring in standard practice is the
   need to develop new organizational models, capable of combining clinical
   effectiveness, low resource consumption, and patient acceptance. Since
   2005, we developed a new model based on `Primary Nursing' in which each
   patient is assigned to a nurse responsible for continuity of care. The
   model is essentially based on a cooperative interaction between the
   roles of an expert reference nurse and a responsible physician with an
   agreed list of respective tasks and responsibilities. After a pilot
   experience, the model was tested in a wide registry, the HomeGuide
   Registry, in which 1650 patients were enrolled. In this setting, remote
   monitoring sensitivity in detecting major cardiovascular events was very
   high (84\%) with a positive predictive value of 97\%. Overall, 95\% of
   asymptomatic and 73\% of actionable events were detected during remote
   monitoring sessions with a median reaction time of 3 days. Manpower was
   remarkably low: 55.5 min per health personnel per month every 100
   patients. The strongest points of this model include strict definition
   of workflow, early reaction, traceability, continuity of care,
   maintaining human relationship with the patient. This model has been
   tested successfully even in a multicentre setting in the Model Project
   Monitor Centre study, in which one monitor centre screened daily remote
   monitoring data from nine satellite clinics.},

Title = {New pedotransfer approaches to predict soil bulk density using WoSIS
   soil data and environmental covariates in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {780},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {For the estimation of the soil organic carbon stocks, bulk density (BD)
   is a fundamental parameter but measured data are usually not available
   especially when dealing with legacy soil data. It is possible to
   estimate BD by applying pedotransfer function (PTF). We applied
   different estimation methods with the aim to define a suitable PTF for
   BD of arable land for the Mediterranean Basin, which has peculiar
   climate features that may influence the soil carbon sequestration. To
   improve the existing BD estimation methods, we used a set of public
   climatic and topographic data along with the soil texture and organic
   carbon data. The present work consisted of the following steps: i)
   development of three PTFs models separately for top (0-0.4 m) and
   subsoil (0.4-1.2 m), ii) a 10-fold cross-validation, iii) model
   transferability using an external dataset derived from published data.
   The development of the new PTFs was based on the training dataset
   consisting of World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) soil profile data,
   climatic data from WorldClim at 1 km spatial resolution and Shuttle
   Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model at 30 m spatial
   resolution.
   The three PTFs models were developed using: Multiple Linear Regression
   stepwise (MLR-S), Multiple Linear Regression backward stepwise (MLR-BS),
   and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
   The predictions of the newly developed PTFs were compared with the BD
   calculated using the PTF proposed by Manrique and Jones (MJ) and the
   modelled BD derived from the global SoilGrids dataset.
   For the topsoil training dataset (N = 129), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN had a
   R-2 0.35, 0.58 and 0.86, respectively. For the model transferability,
   the three PTFs applied to the external topsoil dataset (N = 59),
   achieved R-2 values of 0.06, 0.03 and 0.41. For the subsoil training
   dataset (N = 180), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN the R-2 values were 0.36, 0.46
   and 0.83, respectively. When applied to the external subsoil dataset (N
   = 29), the R-2 values were 0.05, 0.06 and 0.41. The cross-validation for
   both top and subsoil dataset, resulted in an intermediate performance
   compared to calibration and validation with the external dataset. The
   new ANN PTF outperformed MLR-S, MLR-BS, MJ and SoilGrids approaches for
   estimating BD. Further improvements may be achieved by additionally
   considering the time of sampling, agricultural soil management and
   cultivation practices in predictive models. (C) 2021 Published by

Abstract = {Background: Hospital-presenting self-harm is a strong predictor of
   suicide and has substantial human and health service costs. Aims: We
   aimed to identify changes in case ascertainment after implementation of
   a new self-harm reporting field at a tertiary hospital in New South
   Wales, and to report event rates, demographic, and clinical
   characteristics. Method: Self-harm events presenting to the emergency
   department (October 2017 to August 2020) were identified using clinical
   documentation and a new reporting field. Changes in the frequency of
   self-harm in the period after implementation of the self-harm field were
   assessed through Poisson regression models. Results: A twofold increase
   in the frequency of self-harm was detected following the implementation
   of the new reporting field. The annual average age-standardized event
   rate of self-harm was 110.4 per 100,000 (120.8 per 100,000 for females;
   100.1 per 100,000 for males). The highest rates by age and sex were for
   females aged 15-19 years (375 per 100,000) and mates aged 20-24 years
   (175 per 100,000). Limitations: Self-harm identification relies on
   clinician coding practice, which is subject to variability and potential
   under-enumeration. Conclusion: These findings highlight the value of a
   self-harm reporting field in hospital record systems for accurate
   recording and tong-term monitoring of self-harm event rates.},

Title = {Techno-economic assessment of application of solar PV in building sector
   A case study from Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Purpose The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is facing a rapid growth in
   energy demand mainly because of factors like burgeoning population,
   economic growth, modernization and infrastructure development. It is
   estimated that between 2000 and 2017 the power consumption has increased
   from 120 to 315 TWh. The building sector has an important role in this
   respect as it accounts for around 80 percent of the total electricity
   consumption. The situation is imposing significant energy, environmental
   and economic challenges for the country. To tackle these problems and
   curtail its dependence on oil-based energy infrastructure, KSA is aiming
   to develop 9.5 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. The campus of
   the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) has been
   considered as a case study. In the wake of recently announced
   net-metering policy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   prospects of rooftop application of PV in buildings. ArcGIS and PVsyst
   software have been used to determine the rooftop area and undertake PV
   system modeling respectively. Performance of PV system has been
   investigated for both horizontal and tilted installations. The study
   also investigates the economic feasibility of the PV application with
   the help of various economic parameters such as benefit cost ratio,
   simple payback period (SPP) and equity payback periods. An environmental
   analysis has also been carried out with the help of RETScreen software
   to determine the savings in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of PV
   system. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the buildings of
   the university campus for utilizable rooftop areas for PV application.
   Various types of structural, architectural and utilities-related
   features affecting the use of building roofs for PV have been
   investigated to determine the corrected area. To optimize the
   performance of the PV system as well as space utilization, modeling has
   been carried out for both horizontal and tilted applications of panels.
   Detailed economic and environmental assessments of the rooftop PV
   systems have also been investigated in detail. Modern software tools
   such as PVsyst, ArcGIS and RETScreen have also been used for system
   design calculations. Findings Saudi Arabia is embarking on a massive
   solar energy program as it plans to have over 200 GW of installed
   capacity by 2030. With solar energy being the most abundant of the
   available renewable resource for the country, PV is going to be one of
   the main technologies in achieving the set targets. The country has,
   however, unlike global trends, traditionally overlooked the small-scale
   and building-related application of solar PV, focusing mainly on larger
   projects. This study explores the prospects of utilization of solar PV
   on building roofs. Building rooftops are constrained in terms of PV
   application owing to wide ranging obstacles that can be classified into
   five types - structural, services, accessibility, maintenance and
   others. The total building rooftop area in the study zone, calculated
   through ArcGIS has been found to be 857,408 m(2) of which 352,244 m(2)
   is being used as car parking and hence is not available for PV
   application. The available roof area, 505,165 m(2) is further hampered
   by construction and utilities related features including staircases,
   HVAC systems, skylights, water tanks and satellite dish antennas.
   Taking into account the relevant obstructive features, the net rooftop
   area covered by PV panels has been found to be in the range 25-41
   percent depending upon the building typology, with residential buildings
   offering the least. To optimize both the system efficiency and space
   utilization, PV modeling has been carried out with the help of PVsyst
   software for both the tilted and horizontal installations. In terms of
   output, PV panels with tilt angle of 24 degrees have been found to be 9
   percent more efficient compared to the horizontally installed ones.
   Modeling results provide a net annual output 37,750 and 46,050 MWh from
   21.44 and 28.51 MW of tilted and horizontal application of PV panels,
   sufficient to respectively meet 16 and 20 percent of the total campus
   electricity requirements. Findings of the economic analysis reveal the
   average SPP for horizontal and tilted applications of the PV to be 9.2
   and 8.4 years, respectively. The benefit cost ratio for different types
   of buildings for horizontal and tilted application has been found to be
   ranging between 0.89 and 2.08 and 0.83 and 2.15, respectively. As
   electricity tariff in Saudi Arabia has been increased this year by as
   much as 45 percent and there are plans to remove \$54bn of subsidy by
   2020, the cost effectiveness of PV systems will be greatly helped.
   Application of PV in buildings can significantly improve their
   environmental performance as the findings of this study reveal that the
   annual greenhouse gas emission in the KFUPM campus can be reduced by as
   much as 40,199 tons carbon dioxide equivalent. Originality/value The PV
   application on building roof especially from economic perspective is an
   area which has not been addressed thus far. Khan et al. (2017) studied
   the power generation potential for PV application on residential
   buildings in KSA. Asif (2016) also investigated power output potential
   of PV system in different types of buildings. Dehwas et al. (2018)
   adopted a detailed approach to determine utilizability of PV on
   residential building roofs. None of these studies have covered the
   economics of PV systems. This study attempts to address the gap and
   contribute to the scholarship on the subject. It targets to determine
   the power output from different types of building in an urban
   environment by taking into account building roof conditions. It also
   provides detailed economic assessment of PV systems. Subsequent
   environmental savings are also calculated.},

Title = {Agricultural drought characteristics in a typical plain region
   considering irrigation, crop growth, and water demand impacts},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {282},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Hydrological models and drought indices based on simulation of soil
   moisture have been widely used in largescale agricultural drought
   assessments. However, hydrological models often oversimplify crop
   modules and does not consider irrigation, crop growth, and water demand
   impacts. Therefore, in the present study, a coupled hydrological-crop
   growth model Variable Infiltration Capacity - Environmental Policy
   Integrated Climate (VICEPIC) was used to consider the impact of the
   irrigation process on drought and propose a crop water anomaly
   percentage index (CWAPI) based on the crop water demand and consumption
   processes. Identification and assessment methods of drought events were
   also evaluated. The validation results of the VIC-EPIC model showed that
   the correlation coefficients between the MODIS evapotranspiration and
   the simulated evapotranspiration at 37\% merged grids were above 0.74.
   The correlation coefficient (0.79) of the CWAPI-simulated values and
   statistical values of drought area rates was greater than that (0.72) of
   soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), indicating that the
   simulation of drought area rate based on CWAPI was more reasonable.
   After identifying regional drought events and comparing the identified
   characteristic values of these events with the average drought data of
   each city, it was found that SMAPI misjudged some regions with high
   hydraulic conductivity as severe drought regions. This limitation was
   overcome by CWAPI, which directly reflects the degree of crop water
   shortage and considers the impact of irrigation on drought. Agricultural
   drought occurs due to low soil water content, which is caused by rapid
   percolation of soil water and insufficient storage of local and
   irrigation water. This study of drought indices will help develop a more
   timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with droughts by
   considering the impacts of irrigation, crop growth, and water demand on
   drought.},

Title = {Radius based domain clustering for WiFi indoor positioning},
Journal = {SENSOR REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-60},
Abstract = {Purpose - Nowadays, WiFi indoor positioning based on received signal
   strength (RSS) becomes a research hotspot due to its low cost and ease
   of deployment characteristics. To further improve the performance of
   WiFi indoor positioning based on RSS, this paper aims to propose a novel
   position estimation strategy which is called radius-based domain
   clustering (RDC). This domain clustering technology aims to avoid the
   issue of access point (AP) selection.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed positioning approach uses
   each individual AP of all available APs to estimate the position of
   target point. Then, according to circular error probable, the authors
   search the decision domain which has the 50 per cent of the intermediate
   position estimates and minimize the radius of a circle via a RDC
   algorithm. The final estimate of the position of target point is
   obtained by averaging intermediate position estimates in the decision
   domain.
   Findings - Experiments are conducted, and comparison between the
   different position estimation strategies demonstrates that the new
   method has a better location estimation accuracy and reliability.
   Research limitations/implications - Weighted k nearest neighbor approach
   and Naive Bayes Classifier method are two classic position estimation
   strategies for location determination using WiFi fingerprinting. Both of
   the two strategies are affected by AP selection strategies and
   inappropriate selection of APs may degrade positioning performance
   considerably.
   Practical implications - The RDC positioning approach can improve the
   performance of WiFi indoor positioning, and the issue of AP selection
   and related drawbacks is avoided.
   Social implications - The RSS-based effective WiFi indoor positioning
   system can makes up for the indoor positioning weaknesses of global
   navigation satellite system. Many indoor location-based services can be
   encouraged with the effective and low-cost positioning technology.
   Originality/value - A novel position estimation strategy is introduced
   to avoid the AP selection problem in RSS-based WiFi indoor positioning
   technology, and the domain clustering technology is proposed to obtain a
   better accuracy and reliability.},

Title = {Diagnosis of Nitrogen Nutrition in Sugar Beet Based on the

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Sugar beet is an important economic crop in Northwest China. In this
   area, efficient use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has become crucial due to
   decreased profits associated with both under- and oversupply relative to
   sugar beet requirements. Thus, fast and non-destruction diagnostic tools
   for estimating plant N status have an important role in reducing N
   inputs while maintaining sugar beet yield and qualify. The objective of
   our study was to quantify leaf color characterization of sugar beet with
   an inexpensive scanner and establish the relationship with yield, leaf
   nitrogen content (LNC), plant total nitrogen content (PTNC), chlorophyll
   content (CC), soil nitrate nitrogen content (SNNC) and soil plant
   analysis development (SPAD) readings in sugar beet. In 2017 and 2018,
   field experiments were conducted with five N treatments ranging from 0
   to 180 kg N ha(-1). The main results showed the following: The SPAD
   readings (SPR) and CC exhibited a significant or highly significant
   correlation (maximum = 0.70, P < 0.01), both of which reflected well the
   N nutrient status of the entire plant. Furtherly, a detailed association
   analysis revealed that there was a close relationship (maximum = - 0.63,
   P < 0.01) of LNC, SPR, PTNC, CC and yield with leaf color parameter
   Red/Blue (R/B), which was recommended as leaf color parameters for N
   diagnosis in sugar beet. In addition, based on the distribution of R/B
   value under different N rate, the yield was low with greater R/B value
   than 1.36 indicating an insufficient N supply, and with the R/B value
   was lower than 1.36, the theoretical yield reached its peak indicating
   an adequate supply of N fertilizer. To summarize, compared to the
   complicated and expensive of hyperspectral and other remote sensing
   technologies, scanned leaf image (SLI) processing technique was a
   simple, inexpensive and reliable method of determining sugar beet N
   status that has potential as a diagnostic tool for determining crop N
   requirement.},

Abstract = {Marine user-environment conflicts can have consequences for ecosystems
   that negatively affect humans. Strategies and tools are required to
   identify, predict, and mitigate the conflicts that arise between marine
   anthropogenic activities and wildlife. Estimating individual-,
   population-, and species-scale distributions of marine animals has
   historically been challenging, but electronic tagging and tracking
   technologies (i.e., biotelemetry and biologging) and analytical tools
   are emerging that can assist marine spatial planning (MSP) efforts by
   documenting animal interactions with marine infrastructure (e.g., tidal
   turbines, oil rigs), identifying critical habitat for animals (e.g.,
   migratory corridors, foraging hotspots, reproductive or nursery zones),
   or delineating distributions for fisheries exploitation. MSP that
   excludes consideration of animals is suboptimal, and animal space-use
   estimates can contribute to efficient and responsible exploitation of
   marine resources that harmonize economic and ecological objectives of
   MSP. This review considers the application of animal tracking to MSP
   objectives, presents case studies of successful integration, and
   provides a look forward to the ways in which MSP will benefit from
   further integration of animal tracking data.},

Title = {A new perspective on the impacts of<i> Spartina</i><i> alterniflora</i>
   invasion on Chinese wetlands in the context of climate change: A case
   study of the Jiuduansha Shoals, Yangtze Estuary},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {868},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, was introduced to the Chinese
   coastal zone in the early 90s. As an eco-engineering species, S.
   alterniflora not only alters saltmarsh species distributions, previously
   described as habitat deg-radation, but it also plays a vital role in
   coastal protection, especially for the development of recently emerged
   inter-tidal shoals. To provide a reference for coastal management under
   global change, we quantified the impact of the invasion process on
   provided ecological and coastal protection functions, exemplified at the
   emerging Jiuduansha Shoals (JDS) in the Yangtze Estuary. Results
   obtained by high-precision satellite monitoring and numerical modelling
   showed that the establishment and growth of S. alterniflora can exert
   considerable changes on local environment. The invasion of S.
   alterniflora to JDS wetland can be divided into three distinct phases,
   (1) establishment 1998-2003, (2) ex-pansion 2003-2009, and (3) dominant
   2009-2018 stages according to the changes in saltmarsh composition.
   Spa-tially, S. alterniflora continuously replaced Scirpus mariqueter,
   forcing S. mariqueter and Phragmites australis slowly to the lower and
   higher intertidal habitats, respectively. Notably, S. alterniflora
   expansion was the main driver that con-tributed to over 70 \% of recent
   JDS wetland expansion even under sediment deficit conditions.
   Established S. alterniflora marsh (directly) dampens more waves because
   of aboveground stems, but it also causes more accretion and indirectly
   leads to higher ``morphological{''} wave dampening. Thus, it increases
   coastal defense provided by the saltmarsh in the context of sea-level
   rise and strengthening storms. In conclusion, the role of S.
   alterniflora invasion to the local environment under global changes is
   controversial. For sustainable coastal management, we need context
   -dependent S. alterniflora management to maximize the benefit of coastal
   protection and minimize the impact on local ecology, especially in
   sediment-starving estuaries with expected coastline retreat.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an automated approach for efficient detection of
   building regions in complex environments. We investigate the shadow
   evidence to focus on building regions, and the shadow areas are detected
   by recently developed false colour shadow detector. The directional
   spatial relationship between buildings and their shadows in image space
   is modelled with the prior knowledge of illumination direction. To do
   that, an approach based on fuzzy landscapes is presented. Once all
   landscapes are collected, a pruning process is applied to eliminate the
   landscapes that may occur due to non-building objects. Thereafter, we
   benefit from a graph-theoretic approach to accurately detect building
   regions. We consider the building detection task as a binary
   partitioning problem where a building region has to be accurately
   separated from its background. To solve the two-class partitioning, an
   iterative binary graph-cut optimization is performed. In this paper, we
   redesign the input requirements of the iterative partitioning from the
   previously detected landscape regions, so that the approach gains an
   efficient fully automated behaviour for the detection of buildings.
   Experiments performed on 10 test images selected from QuickBird (0.6 m)
   and Geoeye-1 (0.5 m) high resolution datasets showed that the presented
   approach accurately localizes and detects buildings with arbitrary
   shapes and sizes in complex environments. The tests also reveal that
   even under challenging environmental and illumination conditions (e.g.
   low solar elevation angles, snow cover) reasonable building detection
   performances could be achieved by the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Garut is a regency that closely adjacent to the capital of the West Java
   Indonesia province, Bandung. This position makes Garut functioning as
   satellite and hinterland to some big cities near Jakarta, Indonesia's
   capital. Infrastructure projects in this area continuously grow to
   support the development and uprising of the economic index. On the other
   hand, Garut regency is prone to natural hazards, including earthquake
   shaking originating from the South Java subduction zone or local fault
   near the area. Consequently, seismic microzonation assessment to manage
   earthquake risk is necessary to perform at the expected
   earthquake-catastrophic-affected areas. In 2018 Puslitbang BMKG
   conducted a microzonation survey at 131 sites within the Garut area and
   obtained soil characteristics in value of the dominant period, dominant
   frequency, and ground shear strain. Based on the range value of the
   dominant period (T0), sub-district of Tarogong Kidul, Tarogong Kaler and
   Garut city is dominated by soft soil, and based on ground shear strain
   measurement showed some area have the potency to experience building
   cracks, building displacement and liquefaction if shaken by a
   significant earthquake. Those kinds of information would provide
   guidelines for city planning and in deciding the new suited structure.},

Abstract = {Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of
   transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with
   wireless Internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways.
   If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be
   enormous.
   This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group
   endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G
   and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of
   the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG
   (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed
   access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals
   cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on
   this planet.
   While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the
   world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination
   to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost
   of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin
   down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important.
   But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the
   goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can
   bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create
   large global projects and influence the network service providers,
   manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU
   working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the
   relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes
   into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach
   to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those
   living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and
   industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are
   available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems
   level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable.
   In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to
   be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer
   interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who
   are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the
   devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible
   spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to
   increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable
   deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is
   intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology
   gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is
   affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the
   targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative
   business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the
   long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural
   population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE)
   Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service
   providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation
   Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting
   from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.},

Title = {Microsatellite Analysis of Genetic Diversity and Population Structure of
   the Iranian Kurdish Horse},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EQUINE VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Native breeds are essential for national stocks and genetic reservoir;
   therefore, the preservation of indigenous breeds is a key policy
   priority for countries around the world. Many conservationists would
   assert that genetic diversity is a prerequisite for adaptive evolution,
   and preserving genetic diversity will need conservation efforts for the
   long-term survival of domestic species. This study intended to evaluate
   the genetic diversity of the Iranian Kurdish horse population based on
   microsatellite indicators, which can partially prevent it from becoming
   extinct. Fifty-eight tail hair and blood samples were randomly collected
   from Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Ilam, West Azerbaijan, Isfahan, Kerman,
   Hamadan, and Tehran. Genomic DNA extraction was performed by a modified
   salting out method. The polymerase chain reaction amplification
   conditions were also separately undertaken for each marker. All
   microsatellite loci revealed polymorphisms in the studied population.
   Genetic variation was examined using 12 micro satellite loci (HMS7,
   HMS3, HMS2, HMS6, ASB2, ASB23, VHL20, HTG10, LEX33, ASB17, AHT4, and
   AHT5). We found that the means of the observed and effective number of
   alleles were 7.58 and 4.95, with the minimum and maximum values for each
   of these indices associated with the loci of HMS2 and ASB17,
   respectively. Moreover, the mean of observed and expected
   heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, and Shannon's
   Information Index of the Iranian Kurdish population were 0.77, 0.78,
   0.75, and 1.67, respectively, indicating a high degree of genetic
   diversity in the entire studied population. More specifically, we
   acquired a range of new alleles in the Iranian Kurdish horse breed that
   differed in their genetic structure to those of other Iranian breeds in
   other studies. This study provides an exciting opportunity to improve
   our knowledge of genetic information which will be beneficial as a base
   to identify purebred Kurdish horses for a further Iranian Kurdish horse
   genetic and breeding program.},

Title = {Indexing soil properties through constructing minimum datasets for soil
   quality assessment of surface and profile soils of intermontane valley
   (Barak, North East India)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil quality (SQ) assessment considering surface and profile soils holds
   great significance in sustainable soil health management. We assessed
   the effect of land-use systems (agriculture, forest and plantation) on
   SQ using three SQ indices (SQI) models namely additive (SQIa), weighted
   additive (SQIw) and nemoro (SQIn) from total (TDS) and minimum (MDS)
   datasets in the intermontane valley soils of North East India (Barak
   Valley). Surface samples were taken from 13 to 24 cm depth and profile
   samples were taken up to 102-167 cm depth from 67 profiles selected by
   multi-layer thematic overlay analysis of agro-physical parameters with
   Survey of India (SOI) topo-sheets at 1:50 K scale as base map. The
   estimated SQIs averaged over models and land-uses were nearly two-fold
   higher for surface (0.751 +/- 0.03) and profile (0.722 +/- 0.02) soils
   from TDS than the MDS (surface: 0.398 +/- 0.09; profile: 0.333 +/- 0.06)
   approach. The SQIn model underestimated the SQI values by 28-35\% less
   than SQIa and SQIw for both datasets. The effect of land-uses on SQIs
   values was mostly non-significant (p > 0.05) for both surface and
   profile soils. We mapped (at 1: 50 K scale) spatial variability in SQ
   grades as poor, medium, good and very good in quality and validated by
   error matrix and Kappa analysis against independent variable (NDVI map
   derived from Landsat 8). The SQ maps developed from TDS were superior to
   MDS in Kappa agreement. Among the models, SQIw followed by SQIa from TDS
   had better Kappa agreement in representing spatial distribution of SQ
   across soil depth and land-use. We propose the SQIw model as a better
   option to evaluate soil quality of surface and profile soils with a
   satisfactory level of accuracy and reliability since it is independent
   of qualitative assumptions and superior in Kappa agreement for spatial
   variability mapping. The information generated can be harnessed for
   managing soil health in intermontane valleys and other such similar
   agro-ecological regions.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of drought and return periods over the East
   African region using Standardized Precipitation Index from 1920 to 2016},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {237},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {East African region is susceptible to drought due to high variation in
   monthly precipitation. Studying drought at regional scale is vital since
   droughts are considered a `creeping' disaster by nature with devasting
   and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded
   damages. This study assessed drought exceedance and return years over
   East Africa from 1920 to 2016 using Climate Research Unit (CRU)
   precipitation data records. Meteorological drought, where precipitation
   is the central quantity of interest, was adopted in the work.
   Standardize Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to study long term
   meteorological droughts and also to assess drought magnitude, frequency,
   exceedance probability and return years using Joint Probability Density
   Function (JPDF). Also, Mann-Kendall trend analysis was applied to
   precipitation and SPI to investigate the trend changes. Results showed
   that years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1920 - 22, 1926 - 29,
   1942 - 46 and 1947 - 51 with values corresponding to 2.2, 3.2, 3.4 and
   2.6, respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from
   1930 - 31, 1988 - 89 and 2001 - 02 with values as 0.2, 0.12 and 0.15,
   respectively. The longest droughts occurred from 1926 - 29, 1937 - 41,
   1942 - 46, 1947 - 51, 1952 - 56, and 1958 - 61 with values in years as
   3, 4, 4, 4, 4, and 3 years, respectively, while the shortest droughts
   occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 -31, 1964 - 65,
   1979 - 80, 1981 - 82, 1983 - 84, 1988 - 89, 1991 - 92, 1993 - 94, 1996 -
   97 and 2001 - 02. Also, it was demonstrated that probability of drought
   occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short
   time intervals and not all severest drought took longer periods. The SPI
   trends indicate high positive (negative) pixels above (below) the
   zero-trend mark, indicating that drought prevails in both low and high
   elevation areas up to 2000 m. There was no direct link between ENSO and
   drought but arguably the association of drought in most El Nino and La
   Nina years suggests that the impact of ENSO cannot be ruled out since
   peak ENSO events occur during October to March periods which coincides
   with the short (SON) and long (MAM) rainy seasons of East Africa. The
   study is particularly relevant in being able to depict continuous and
   synoptic drought condition all over East Africa, providing vital
   information to farmers and policy makers, using very cost-effective
   method.},

   severe cold regions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {In the context of global warming, urban climate problems such as heat
   waves, urban heat islands and air pollution are becoming increasingly
   prominent, and the cooling effect of rivers is an effective way to
   mitigate urban hot climate. This study investigates the surrounding
   urban area of the Hun River in Shenyang, a severe cold region of China,
   by calculating satellite inversion surface temperature and urban
   morphology data, and explores the cooling effect of rivers using linear
   regression models and spatial regression models. The results show that
   (1) water bodies have a cooling effect on the surrounding environment,
   with the farthest cooling distance being 4,000 m, but the optimal
   cooling distance being 2,500 m. (2) In the results of the spatial
   regression model analysis, the R-2 value stays above 0.7 in the range of
   0-4,000 m, indicating that urban morphological factors are closely
   related to LST (land surface temperature). The negative correlation is
   most pronounced for NVDI (normalized vegetation index), with a peak of
   -14.8075 calculated by the regression model, and the positive
   correlation is most pronounced for BD (building density), with a peak of
   8.5526. (3) The urban thermal environment can be improved and the heat
   island effect mitigated through measures such as increasing urban
   vegetation cover and reducing building density, and these findings can
   provide data references and case studies to support urban planning and
   development departments.},

Abstract = {Monitoring changes in the vegetation cover during the intercrop season
   is of special interest in intensive agricultural region, such as the
   Brittany region in France, to locate bare soils and control their
   influence to the environment. The presence of bare soils leads to
   detrimental environmental effects such as soil erosion or water quality
   degradation. Therefore, identification and monitoring of bare soils at a
   regional scale in the winter season are required for any agricultural
   management program. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer have been selected for this paper due to their low
   spatial resolution, which decreases the cost of processing and storage,
   and the high revisit frequency, which increases the probability to
   acquire scenes free of clouds and shadows during the winter season.
   Unfortunately, few images per season only are free of cloud
   contamination and associated shadows. Therefore, the specific objective
   of this paper is to develop and implement a preprocessing method to
   recover spectral values of contaminated data by weather conditions for
   subsequent bare-soil mapping. In the context of this paper, Kohonen's
   self-organizing map (SOM) is used for recovering data contaminated by
   weather conditions that have been considered as erroneous data. This
   nonparametric regression procedure has proved its success to deal with
   missing-values problem. Hence, the erroneous-values problem, reflectance
   values contaminated by clouds or shadows, has been converted to the
   missing-values problem by using a cloud and shadow (outlier) detector.
   The SOM algorithm was tested also on the erroneous data directly, but
   better results were found with the ``missing values{''} formulation. The
   idea is to, first, train SOM onto clear temporal profiles free of clouds
   and shadows during the winter season. Second, erroneous values are
   converted to missing values by an outlier detector which operates on
   each temporal profile (set of colocated pixels acquired at different
   dates). Finally, the SOM algorithm for missing values is used to
   estimate contaminated reflectance values.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {On 1 April 2022, the AlfaCrux CubeSat was launched by the Falcon 9
   Transporter-4 mission, the fourth SpaceX dedicated smallsat rideshare
   program mission, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space
   Force Station in Florida into a Sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km.
   AlfaCrux is an amateur radio and educational mission to provide learning
   and scientific benefits in the context of small satellite missions. It
   is an opportunity for theoretical and practical learning about the
   technical management, systems design, communication, orbital mechanics,
   development, integration, and operation of small satellites. The
   AlfaCrux payload, a software-defined radio hardware, is responsible for
   two main services, which are a digital packet repeater and a
   store-and-forward system. In the ground segment, a cloud-computing-based
   command and control station has been developed, together with an open
   access online platform to access and visualize the main information of
   the AlfaCrux telemetry and user data and experiments. It also becomes an
   in-orbit database reference to be used for different studies concerned
   with, for instance, radio propagation, attitude reconstruction,
   data-driven calibration algorithms for satellite sensors, among others.
   In this context, this paper describes the AlfaCrux mission, its main
   subsystems, and the achievements obtained in the early orbit phase.
   Scientific and engineering assessments conducted with the spacecraft
   operations to tackle unexpected behaviors in the ground station and also
   to better understand the space environment are also presented and
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Analyses of avian demographic patterns across entire, contiguous
   landscapes are rare, but such analyses are important for understanding
   population dynamics. We selected the Black-throated Sparrow in the
   northern Chihuahuan Desert as a model to test patterns of abundance and
   nest success. across a landscape. We integrated abundance, nest density,
   and nesting success measured on sampling plots with a classified
   satellite map of the distribution of seven habitat types to analyze
   spatial and temporal patterns contributing to the population dynamics of
   this species.
   Adult relative abundance ranged from <1 bird/100 ha in pinyon-juniper
   habitat to 2439 birds/100 ha in shrubland habitats. Nest density was
   consistently high in mesquite, moderate to high in creosotebush, and low
   in black grama grassland; this value exhibited more temporal variability
   than relative abundance of adults. Nest success rates exhibited a strong
   habitat effect and ranged from 8\% in mesquite to 47\% in black grama
   grassland; overall population nest success. was 0.266. In all three
   years, nest success in mesquite was significantly lower than in all
   other habitat types (P < 0.01). There was no correlation between nest
   success and adult relative abundance.
   While mesquite habitat contained about one-third of all adults in the
   three years of the study, it contributed as. little as 10\% of
   successful nests. In creosotebush, the relative contribution to both
   adult abundance and successful nests was relatively high. Mesa grassland
   contained relatively few adults, but up to 44\% of successful nests. We
   discuss how habitat selection theory suggests mechanisms for the
   observed patterns. Mesquite appears to be a population sink for
   Black-throated Sparrows and may be, an ecological trap. While we do not
   propose that there is cause for conservation concern for this widespread
   species, our results, underscore the pitfalls associated with using
   adult abundance as an indicator of habitat quality. The method presented
   here is applicable for man), species and ecosystems and, thus, may be an
   important tool for conservation and management, as well as a new avenue
   for scientific investigation of landscape-level population dynamics.},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Forest attributes including canopy health and stand structure were
   Visually assessed to identify features commonly associated with the bell
   miner (Manorina melanophrys, Meliphagidae), a cooperatively breeding,
   insectivorous honeyeater endemic to south-eastern Australia. A
   stratified random sampling methodology, using a combination of SPOTS
   satellite imagery and a 25-m pixel digital altitude model, was used to
   establish 130 circular plots 40 in in diameter within a 12800 ha Study
   area in the Watagan mountain range, central coast of New South Wales
   (NSW). In this Study site, the presence of bell miners was significantly
   associated with unhealthy eucalypt crowns. This supports the proposition
   that a dieback syndrome known as bell-miner-associated dieback (BMAD)
   exists in central coastal forests of NSW. Our results also demonstrate a
   strong association of a sparse eucalypt canopy over a dense lower
   midstorey with the presence of bell miners. Altitude and fire frequency
   were negatively correlated with bell miners while the topographical
   wetness index was positively correlated with bell miners. Logistic
   regression was used to quantify the effects of a series of explanatory
   variables including tree species, forest structure variables and
   selected topographic variables. Although there were significant
   differences in the ranking of crown condition between eucalypt species,
   tree species was not selected in the final model. The final variables
   identified by the logistic regression for the presence of bell miners
   included sparse eucalypt overstorey cover, dense lower midstorey cover..
   the absence Of Young vigorous regrowth trees and higher values of the
   topographic wetness index. Based on the results of our survey we discuss
   practical options for managing the forest dieback syndrome associated
   with bell miners in the central coast region of NSW and an approach to
   mapping forests at risk from BMAD.},

Abstract = {This paper puts forward a new approach to principal component analysis

   potential of applications in the economic and management field. We
   derive a full set of numerical characteristics and variance-covariance

   PCA approach. Our approach is able to use all of the variance
   information in the original data than the prevailing representative-type
   approach in the literature which only uses centers, vertices, etc. The
   paper also provides an accurate approach to constructing the
   observations in a PC space based on the linear additivity property of
   normal distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   illustrated by simulated numerical experiments. At last, our method is
   applied to explain the puzzle of risk-return tradeoff in China's stock

Title = {Catastrophic PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions from Siberian forest fires:
   Impacting factors analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {306},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {With increased forest fires due to climate change, PM2.5 emissions also
   intensified. Record PM2.5 emissions according to Copernicus Atmosphere
   Monitoring Service in Russia amounted to 8 megatons (Mt) in 2021, which
   is 78\% higher than the average level of 2004-2021 (4.5 Mt). Seven
   federal subjects (the constituent entities) with vast forest areas
   without fire protection produced 86\% of emissions (6.8 Mt) in 2021, the
   major losses (6.1 Mt) in Yakutia (Sakha Republic). The ambient
   temperature in Eastern Siberia is increasing, especially in months of
   winter and spring seasons (up to +3.6 degrees C) in 1990-2020 compared
   to 1901-2020 (CEDA Archive); climate change has affected meteorological
   conditions leading to increased forest fires. The results of the SARIMAX
   model study for PM2.5 emissions considering meteorological factors using
   ERA5 and burnt forest area using MODIS (MCD64A1), establishing a
   significant dependence of PM2.5 emissions on the lack of precipitation
   and the associated parameters of complete and potential evaporation.
   This influence long before the fire season (up to 9 months), as it
   affects the snow cover and the dryness of the fuel by the beginning of
   forest fires. In turn, high PM2.5 emission values are accompanied by a
   drop in 2 m air temperature and surface solar radiation downwards due to
   the aerosol saturation with suspended particles. The average COR for
   seven federal subjects was 0.79, with the highest forecast result in
   Yakutia (0.95), indicating the maximum propensity for record emissions
   due to weather conditions. In combination with forest management without
   fire protection, meteorological parameters have caused an increase in
   PM2.5 emissions in recent years in Siberia. The forest needs other ways
   to manage under the pressures of climate change to reduce environmental
   pollution associated with PM2.5 emissions from vast Siberian fires.},

Abstract = {With the increase in data, the challenges of complex data, and the
   financial implications of improved insolation accuracy, it has become
   necessary to include targeted Artificial Intelligence \& Machine
   Learning (AI/ML) for insolation forecasting. Forecasting is a crucial
   and cost-effective tool for integrating variable renewable resources
   into power systems. The ability to accurately forecast irradiance will
   facilitate increased PV adoption on the grid by making the intermittency
   less disrupting and allowing for better PV utilization, directly
   assisting in reduction of carbon energy sources.
   A key problem in solar forecasting is the intermittency of cloud cover,
   which often exhibits fractal properties and is still challenging to
   predict and adversely impacts solar farm output management. The physical
   models which cover weather can only provide a certain level of
   predictive accuracy and are particularly challenged by cloud
   forecasting. The key challenges are: limitations in the physical models,
   massive data, the need to make substantial simplifying estimations.
   We propose an approach and methodology which can enhance the predictive
   capabilities of insolation forecasting based on, and leveraging, a type
   of ``bundled{''} approach which takes into account both the physical
   models, as well as the empirical mode determined by AI/ML, and
   exploiting sensor and satellite inputs. The novel aspect is to expand
   the AI/ML empirical dimension to achieve improved forecasting where the
   ``non-physical-model{''} modes provide substantial input. We outline the
   specific methodology, how this is different from current modes, and how
   it can improve insolation forecasting. Specific examples will be
   provided and the benefits discussed.},

Title = {Carbon Isotope Discrimination (δ<SUP>13</SUP>C) of Grape Musts Is a
   Reliable Tool for Zoning and the Physiological Ground-Truthing of Sensor
   Maps in Precision Viticulture},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Carbon stable isotope composition of berry must at harvest (delta C-13)
   is an integrated assessment of plant water status during grape (Vitis
   viniferaL.) berry ripening. Measurement of delta C-13 of grape juice is
   proposed as an alternative to traditional measurements of water status
   to capture the spatial variability of physiological response at the
   vineyard scale, i.e., zoning. We performed samplings at four different
   locations in California, United States, with three different cultivars
   of table and wine grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Crimson-Seedless).
   Leaf physiology (photosynthesis,A(N), stomatal conductance,g(s)) and
   stem water potentials (psi(stem)) were routinely measured. The delta
   C-13 was measured at harvest and strong relationships were found between
   psi(stem)(R-2= 0.71), stomatal conductance (R-2= 0.71), net carbon
   assimilation (R-2= 0.59) and WUEi (R-2= 0.53). The role of leaf nitrogen
   on the signal was assessed by evaluating relationships between leaf
   nitrogen and WUEi(R-2= 0.54), Ci/Ca (R-2= 0.51), delta C-13 (R-2= 0.44),
   and psi(stem)(R-2= 0.37). Although nitrogen can be among the
   environmental factors able to affect the delta C-13 signal, this
   difference is only observable when variability inNis very large, by
   pooling different vineyards/varieties, but not at the within-vineyard
   scale. The utility of delta C-13 was further tested and measured on
   grape berries sampled on an equidistant grid in a 3.5 ha vineyard where
   psi(stem)was also measured throughout the field season and used to
   delineate management zones. Physiological measurements and grape
   composition were correlated to soil electrical resistivity and
   satellite-derived vegetation index. The two management zones obtained by
   delta C-13 or psi(stem)were spatially similar at 67\% and allowed to
   separate the harvest in two pools having statistically different grape
   composition (soluble solids, organic acids, and anthocyanin profiles).
   Zoning by delta C-13 performed as well as zoning by psi(stem)to separate
   grape phenolic composition, e.g., for selective harvest. Our results
   provided evidence that delta C-13 of grape must is a reliable and
   repeatable assessor of plant water status and gas exchange in vineyard
   systems that are crucial for zoning vineyards, even when irrigated, and
   for ground-truthing sensor maps in precision viticulture.},

Abstract = {The world faces the threat of an energy crisis that is exacerbated by
   the dominance of fossil energy sources that negatively impact the
   sustainability of the earth's ecosystem. Currently, efforts to increase
   the supply of renewable energy have become a global agenda, including
   using solar energy which is one of the rapidly developing clean
   energies. However, studies in solar photovoltaic (PV) modelling that
   integrates geospatial information of urban morphological building
   characters, solar radiation, and multiple meteorological parameters in
   low-cost scope have not been explored fully. Therefore, this research
   aims to model the urban rooftop solar PV development in the Global South
   using Bandung, Indonesia, as a case study. This research also has
   several specific purposes: developing a building height model as well as
   determining the energy potential of rooftop solar PV, the energy needs
   of each building, and the residential property index. This study is
   among the first to develop the national digital surface model (DSM) of
   buildings. In addition, the analysis of meteorological effects
   integrated with the hillshade parameter was used to obtain the solar PV
   potential value of the roof in more detail. The process of integrating
   building parameters in the form of rooftop solar PV development
   potential, energy requirements, and residential property index of a
   building was expected to increase the accuracy of determining priority
   buildings for rooftop solar PV deployment in Bandung. This study shows
   that the estimated results of effective solar PV in Bandung ranges from
   351.833 to 493.813 W/m(2), with a total of 1316 and 36,372 buildings in
   scenarios 1 and 2 being at a high level of priority for solar PV
   development. This study is expected to be a reference for the Indonesian
   government in planning the construction of large-scale rooftop solar PV
   in urban areas to encourage the rapid use of clean energy. Furthermore,
   this study has general potential for other jurisdictions for the
   governments focusing on clean energy using geospatial information in
   relation with buildings and their energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the future land use and land cover (LULC) type in
   some parts of Ethiopia, but not in the study area. This study aims to
   predict and analyze the future scenarios of LULC (2015-2033) using
   cellular automata and Markov Chain model (CA\_Markov) by taking into
   consideration the physical and socio-economic drivers of LULC dynamics.
   The historical LULC change data of 1984-1995, 1995-2015, and 1984-2015
   were used as a baseline. Both transition rules and transition area
   matrix for the period 1984-1995, 1995-2015, and 1984-2015 were produced
   quantitatively using the Markov chain model. After that, the physical
   and socio-economic factors were standardized using fuzzy and then
   Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) was used to produce the transition
   suitability image. The CA\_Markov model was then applied as a standard
   contiguity filter of 5 x 5 to predict the 2033 LULC condition using the
   TerrSet Geospatial Modeling and Monitoring System software. The result
   indicated that forestland are predicted to increase by 108 sq km
   (44.5\%), shrub/bush lands 710 sq km (20\%), built-up area 286.2 sq km
   (48.3\%), and grasslands 31 sq km (15\%), respectively. However,
   significant reductions (losses) in a water body (Wb) 5.2 sq km (11.2\%),
   croplands (Cl) 78.9 sq km (1.3\%), barren lands (Bl) 800 sq km (27.4\%),
   and floodplain area (Fp) 251.68 sq km (33.7\%), respectively.
   Furthermore, the Pearson correlation result between the historical and
   predicted LULC type indicated that there are positive, strongly
   correlated, and are statistically significant relationships (r = 0.981,
   p = 0.000). The increase in forest land and reduction in barren and
   flood plain may benefit the study area. However, the decrease in the
   water body may contribute to the severity of drought in the area. This
   study may help to use as useful information to foster better decisions
   and improve policies in land use within the framework of sustainable
   land use planning system.},

Title = {Parameters adaptive adjustment strategy of quantum communication channel
   in free-space based on software-defined quantum communication},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Quantum communication in free space will be disturbed by natural
   environment, such as fog, dust, and rain, which is a difficult problem
   in the construction of quantum communication system. In order to solve
   this problem and improve the survivability of quantum communication
   system, we propose an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy for
   free-space quantum communication based on software-defined quantum
   communication (SDQC). Firstly, we propose a software-defined quantum
   communication model based on the idea of software defined networks. The
   architecture of SDQC is divided into four layers: transport layer,
   access layer, control layer, and management layer. The SDQC system sends
   the link information to the preset program at a management level through
   the real-time monitoring of channel state by the access layer. According
   to the link information, the management level issues instructions to the
   control layer to adjust the parameters such as the initial quantum state
   and the existence time of single quantum state, in order to improve the
   quantum entanglement and fidelity. Secondly, we analyze the relationship
   between quantum fidelity and parameters in SDQC system under three noise
   channels, i.e. depolarization channel, spontaneous amplitude decay
   channel, and phase damping channel. In the depolarized channel, the
   quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase of the error probability
   P-d of the qubit. When the error probability of qubit is certain, the
   system has the maximum quantum fidelity with the value of parameter x is
   0.5. In the spontaneous amplitude decay channel, the quantum fidelity F
   decreases with the increase of the quantum state transition probability
   p(t). When the transition probability of quantum state is certain, the
   higher the value of parameter x, the higher the fidelity will be. In the
   phase-damped channel, the quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase
   of the probability p(c) with which the qubit and the background
   interference equivalent quantum state have complete elastic scattering.
   When the probability is certain, the larger the value of |1/2 - x|, the
   higher the quantum fidelity of the system will be. Finally, we study the
   optimal values of SDQC system parameters under different environmental
   disturbances. The simulation results show that the optimal parameters of
   SDQC system are different when the parameters of three noise channels,
   namely depolarization, spontaneous amplitude decay and phase damping,
   are different. The system adaptively selects the initial quantum state
   and the existence time of single quantum state according to the
   environmental change and business demand, so that the quantum fidelity
   is always at the peak in the communication process. This strategy
   effectively improves the adaptability and comprehensive immunity of the
   quantum communication system.},

Title = {Distributed Hydrological Model Based on Machine Learning Algorithm:
   Assessment of Climate Change Impact on Floods},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rapid population growth, economic development, land-use modifications,
   and climate change are the major driving forces of growing hydrological
   disasters like floods and water stress. Reliable flood modelling is
   challenging due to the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation
   intensity, duration and frequency, heterogeneity in temperature rise and
   land-use changes. Reliable high-resolution precipitation data and
   distributed hydrological model can solve the problem. This study aims to
   develop a distributed hydrological model using Machine Learning (ML)
   algorithms to simulate streamflow extremes from satellite-based
   high-resolution climate data. Four widely used bias correction methods
   were compared to select the best method for downscaling coupled model
   intercomparison project (CMIP6) global climate model (GCMs) simulations.
   A novel ML-based distributed hydrological model was developed for
   modelling runoff from the corrected satellite rainfall data. Finally,
   the model was used to project future changes in runoff and streamflow
   extremes from the downscaled GCM projected climate. The Johor River
   Basin (JRB) in Malaysia was considered as the case study area. The
   distributed hydrological model developed using ML showed Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (NSE) values of 0.96 and 0.78 and Root Mean Square Error
   (RMSE) of 4.01 and 5.64 during calibration and validation. The simulated
   flow analysis using the model showed that the river discharge would
   increase in the near future (2020-2059) and the far future (2060-2099)
   for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The largest change
   in river discharge would be for SSP-585. The extreme rainfall indices,
   such as Total Rainfall above 95th Percentile (R95TOT), Total Rainfall
   above 99th Percentile (R99TOT), One day Max Rainfall (R x 1day),
   Five-day Max Rainfall (R x 5day), and Rainfall Intensity (RI), were
   projected to increase from 5\% for SSP-119 to 37\% for SSP-585 in the
   future compared to the base period. The results showed that climate
   change and socio-economic development would cause an increase in the
   frequency of streamflow extremes, causing larger flood events.},

Abstract = {Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have
   teamed together to demonstrate the multimission capabilities of
   commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record
   testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across
   air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio
   of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are
   uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the
   ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated
   deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios.
   Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and
   civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely
   controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial
   robots providing services and access that was never before considered
   valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and
   taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling
   subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and
   disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same
   potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance,
   rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these
   systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy.
   We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the
   Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle
   systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center
   (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with
   autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature.
   Additional customized, missioncentric sensors may be added to the
   systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase
   autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication
   architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress
   monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the
   remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level
   of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications
   (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite
   communications for navigation and mission data transfer.
   Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to
   accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of
   other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science
   missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the
   sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while
   characterizing the operating conditions for each test series.
   ``Autonomy{''} is a capability that means different things to different
   people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system
   to react to new information, whether from external source or
   self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of
   an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts
   such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications
   with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through
   these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator
   workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the
   system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance.
   Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these
   objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and
   data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous
   underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation
   Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable
   process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime
   unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing
   the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test
   units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at
   least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate
   capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives.
   We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and
   the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for
   unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving
   that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as
   evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.},

Title = {Two-Dimensional Space Turntable Pitch Axis Trajectory Prediction Method
   Based on Sun Vector and CNN-LSTM Model},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {A two-dimensional space turntable system has been used to ensure that
   the Solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) can track the
   Sun stably, and the prediction of the two-dimensional turntable
   trajectory is an important part of payload health management. Different
   from the dynamic model using traditional trajectory prediction, we
   propose a new method for predicting the pitch axis trajectory of the
   turntable based on the sun vector and a deep learning CNN-LSTM model.
   First, the ideal solar position of the pitch axis was calculated using
   the sun vector. Then, the ideal solar position was combined with the
   running turntable pitch axis motor speed, current, and solar position
   error signal as the CNN-LSTM model input data. The model parameters were
   trained and adjusted through test data simulation using Fengyun-3E
   satellite orbit data. Finally, the next position of the pitch axis was
   predicted. The test results showed that in the sun vector and CNN-LSTM
   model, the RMSE value was 0.623 and the MSE value was 0.388. It was
   better than the LSTM model or CNN model alone and could accurately
   predict the pitch axis position.},

Title = {Precision farming uses typology in arable crop-oriented farms in
   northern France},
Journal = {PRECISION AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-146},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The adoption of precision farming techniques (PFTs) has been widely
   studied targeting specific PFT or farming systems along with the
   potential benefits of these PFTs in terms of yield or input use.
   However, few studies have examined how PFTs are adopted and used at the
   farm level. In this study a preliminary investigation was made of
   on-farm PFT uses in the Oise region (northern France). Three main PFTs
   were identified in the area: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
   guidance, section control, and variable rate (VR) application. For each
   farm, the use of every PFT was defined by the technical characteristics
   of the equipment, the field operation(s) concerned, the targeted
   crop(s), the aim of the use, the PFT adoption drivers, and the perceived
   impacts by the farmers. These different variables were combined into a
   typology of PFT uses. The results show that most of the farms combined
   GNSS guidance for all technical operations and section control, whereas
   VR application was less common. Section control was largely used by
   farmers for liquid fertilizers and phytochemical spraying. The typology
   shows three to five types of use for each PFT, which differ in terms of
   technique adoption drivers, e.g. reducing on-farm work or adaptation to
   field morphology. According to literature, economic impacts were found
   to be the most frequent, however farmers seemed unable to quantify them.
   Social impacts such as reduced work time and fatigue were also frequent
   and are becoming the main motivation for using PFT on farms studied.
   Further research is needed to assess the use trajectories of PFT along
   with the motivations of each PFT use.},

Title = {Individual variation in migratory movements of chinstrap penguins leads
   to widespread occupancy of ice-free winter habitats over the continental
   shelf and deep ocean basins of the Southern Ocean},

Abstract = {A goal of tracking migratory animals is to characterize the habitats
   they use and to interpret population processes with respect to
   conditions experienced en route to, and within, overwintering areas. For
   migratory seabirds with broad breeding ranges, inferring
   population-level effects of environmental conditions that are
   experienced during migratory periods would benefit by directly comparing
   how birds from different breeding aggregations disperse, characterizing
   the physical conditions of areas they use, and determining whether they
   occupy shared foraging areas. We therefore tracked 41 adult and juvenile
   chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) from three breeding locations
   in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region during the austral winter of
   2017. The satellite tracking data revealed overlap of individuals over
   continental shelf areas during autumn months (Mar-May), shared outbound
   corridors that track the southern Antarctic circumpolar current front,
   followed by occupancy of progressively colder, deeper, and ice-free
   waters that spanned the entire western hemisphere south of the Polar
   Front. Despite broadly similar physical environments used by individuals
   from different colonies, the proportion of birds from each colony that
   remained within 500km of their colony was positively correlated with
   their local population trends. This suggests that local migration
   strategies near the Antarctic Peninsula may benefit breeding
   populations. However, the magnitude of inter-colony and intra-colony
   overlap was generally low given the broad scale of habitats occupied.
   High individual variation in winter movements suggests that habitat
   selection among chinstrap penguins is more opportunistic, without clear
   colony-specific preference for fine-scale foraging hotspots. Mixing of
   individuals from multiple colonies across broad regions of the Southern
   Ocean would expose chinstrap penguins from the Antarctic Peninsula to a
   shared environmental experience that helps explain the regional decline
   in their abundance.},

Title = {Transferability of tsetse habitat models between different regions in
   Kenya and Rwanda},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {486},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate and reliable information on the distribution of tsetse habitats
   is crucial for the effective management of African Trypanosomiasis in
   sub-Saharan Africa. However, conducting large-scale surveillance of
   tsetse flies to develop distribution maps is impractical due to vast
   areas infested and limited resources available. To address this
   challenge, we evaluated the applicability of tsetse habitat models
   developed in the intensively sampled Shimba Hills National Reserve in
   Kenya for both the wet and the dry season, to two other regions in Kenya
   (Ruma National Park and Nguruman Conservancy) and one region in Rwanda
   (Akagera National Park). The models utilized satellite-based estimates
   of vegetation greenness, land cover, and land surface temperature,
   combined with tsetse occurrence data, to predict habitat suitability. An
   independent dataset of tsetse occurrence was used to benchmark the
   performance of the transferred models. The performance of the
   transferred models was significantly influenced by the similarity in
   environmental conditions between the model's development area and the
   transfer area. In regions with high dissimilarity, such as Nguruman
   Conservancy during the dry season, model transfer was unsuccessful with
   an F1-score of zero. In all other regions and seasons, the transferred
   models showed satisfactory performance, with F1-score values exceeding
   0.65. Nevertheless, site-specific models out-performed (>0.8 F1-score)
   the transferred models, indicating that models specifically developed
   with data for each location can provide more accurate information on
   tsetse distribution. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that tsetse
   habitat models can be transferred with relatively good accuracies to
   seasons and regions that exhibit environmental similarity with the model
   training area. Despite the higher accuracy of site-specific models,
   transferring models to similar sites remains a meaningful exercise in
   the absence of detailed surveillance data.},

Title = {Do restored oyster reefs benefit seagrasses? An experimental study in
   the Northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {306-313},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Oyster reefs and seagrass beds are being lost worldwide at alarming
   rates. These habitats provide many services to humankind and, thus, much
   effort has been dedicated to their restoration. Here, we examine the
   efficacy of created oyster reefs at enhancing seagrass beds through the
   amelioration of hydrographic conditions and water quality. We carried
   out a field experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico where we compared
   areas shoreward of created reefs with adjacent reef-free areas over
   several years using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design. The
   reefs were built with oyster shell, measured 65 m, and were placed at
   circa 100 m from the shoreline to ensure subtidal conditions and enhance
   oyster recruitment. The BACI results showed few and disparate effects of
   the reefs, even when distance from the reef was factored in. However, we
   found a temporal increase in seagrass cover throughout all the
   experimental area (i.e. including both reef and control plots) following
   reef deployment. Interestingly, further analysis with satellite imagery
   showed the experimental area had higher seagrass cover 5 years after
   reef deployment than it did before reef deployment, but such increase
   was not observed for nearby areas. In concert, the results suggest
   ``shadow{''} effects for the reefs examined, where positive effects on
   seagrass beds extend beyond the area directly shoreward from the reef.
   Oyster reef restoration may have positive impacts on shallow seagrass
   beds in turbid, high-energy systems; however, more work on the extent
   and mechanisms for this interaction is needed.},

Abstract = {Hai Phong city is located in the Northern coast of Vietnam where the
   mangroves are distributed between zone I and zone II among the four
   mangrove zones in Vietnam. This city is vulnerable to rising sea levels
   associated with climate change and tropical cyclones, which are
   forecasted to become more severe due to the impact of climate change. In
   the past, mangrove forests in this city have decreased markedly because
   of over expansion of shrimp farming. Thus, identification of mangrove
   forests is important to monitor and support mangrove conservation and
   management in the coastal zone. The objectives of this research were to
   identify the locations of mangrove and characterize mangrove species in
   Hai Phong using HH and HV backscatters of the Advanced Land Observing
   Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) with enhanced Phased Array L-band Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Image segmentation was used to identify the
   locations of mangrove forests. Moreover, Geographic Information System
   (GIS) was applied to update current status of mangrove species in 2015.
   The results showed that the means of HH and HV backscatter coefficients
   of K. obovata are lower than S. caseolaris. K. obovata has HH value
   around -13.9 dB until -10.3 dB and HV value around -20.6 dB until -16.2
   dB. Higher HH values between about -14.9 dB and -6.8 dB and HV values
   between roughly -20.6 dB and -14.3 dB have observed by S. caseolaris.
   The total area of mangrove forest in Hai Phong in the year 2015 was
   around 4084 hectares, of which S. caseolaris occupied over 68\% and
   mixed mangrove species was approximately 25.6\%. This research indicates
   the potential for the use of L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR in characterizing
   mangrove forest species in the coastal zone.},

Title = {Origin and foraging ecology of male loggerhead sea turtles from southern
   Brazil revealed by genetic and stable isotope analysis},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWA) represents an important foraging
   ground for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Most studies at the
   region have focused on adult females and juveniles, and little is known
   about males. Here, we present the first insights about origin and
   foraging ecology of male loggerheads from the SWA, by integrating
   genetic and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Skin samples were obtained
   from 26 males stranded along the southern coast of Brazil (from 31
   degrees 21S-51 degrees 05W to 33 degrees 44S-53 degrees 22W), from
   February 2014 to March 2017. Samples of potential food sources (benthic
   and pelagic organisms) were also collected for SIA. A fragment of the
   mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced and a Bayesian Mixed
   Stock Analysis was performed to estimate natal origins of male
   loggerheads. Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Models were fitted to assess
   the relative contribution of different food sources assimilated by
   males. Most males exhibit endemic haplotypes from Brazilian rookeries,
   followed by a low frequency of a haplotype from the North Atlantic and
   the Mediterranean Sea, as well as olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivaea)
   haplotype, showing hybridization. SIA showed life stage-related
   differences in feeding and habitat use by male loggerheads, with benthic
   invertebrates dominating the diet of adults, while pelagic prey items
   dominated the diet of juveniles. Our findings demonstrate the importance
   of southern Brazil neritic and oceanic habitats for male loggerheads and
   highlight the value of this area for the maintenance of SWA reproductive
   management units, which are the main contributors to these feeding
   aggregations.},

Abstract = {Fires mediate grass and tree competition and alter vegetation structure
   in savanna ecosystems, with important implications for regional carbon,
   water, and energy fluxes. However, direct observations of how fire
   frequency influences vegetation structure and post-fire recovery have
   been limited to small experimental field studies. Here, we combined
   lidar-derived canopy height and canopy cover from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and
   land Elevation Satellite-2 with over two decades of burned area data
   from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors to
   provide the first biome-wide estimates of post-fire changes in canopy
   structure for major vegetation types in the Cerrado (Brazil). Mean
   canopy height decreased with increasing burn frequency for all natural
   cover types, with the greatest decline observed for forests and
   savannas. The ability to separate changes in fractional canopy cover
   from height growth using lidar data highlighted the long-time scales of
   vegetation recovery in forests and savannas after fire. For forests in
   medium and high precipitation areas, canopy cover returned to unburned
   values within 5 years following fire, whereas mean canopy height
   remained below unburned values, even in the oldest fires (14-20 years).
   Recovery times increased with decreasing rainfall, with average values
   of both fractional cover and canopy height below unburned areas after
   14-20 years for savannas. We observed gradual recovery of vegetation
   height and cover over decades, even in mesic or wet savanna regions like
   the Cerrado. Infrequent fire activity, particularly in areas with
   greater land management, influences ecosystem structure across the
   biome, with important consequences for biodiversity conservation.},

Abstract = {Studies on the genetic diversity and structure in endangered and
   threatened species are of utmost importance to design and promote
   effective conservation and management programs. Ephedra foliata, an
   endemic and threatened species growing naturally in arid and semi-arid
   regions of north western India, was investigated to estimate genetic
   variability and population structure using inter-simple sequence repeats
   (ISSR) and directed amplification of mini-satellite DNA (DAMD) markers.
   Twenty-five (ISSR 15; DAMD 10) markers produced 449 fragments, of which
   382 were polymorphic in nature, revealing 84.59\% polymorphism. ISSR
   markers revealed higher levels of polymorphism, polymorphic information
   content, marker index, diversity index and effective multiplex ratio
   than DAMD markers. Higher values of polymorphism, genetic diversity and
   Shannon information index at species level than at population level
   revealed that E. foliata possess high genetic diversity. AMOVA revealed
   much higher variance within populations than among the populations. The
   three clustering approaches viz., UPGMA, PCoA, and STRUCTURE, grouped
   the eleven investigated populations into two clusters revealing two
   genetic populations and the patterns of clustering of populations was in
   accordance with their geographic distribution, suggesting that these
   populations have evolved in response to their local environments. The
   high level of genetic differentiation (G(ST)=0.31) and moderate gene
   flow (N-m=1.11) among populations could be due to geographic isolation,
   regional climatic conditions, over-exploitation and improper seed
   setting. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first endeavour
   to estimate genetic diversity and population structure of E. foliata
   using molecular markers.},

Title = {Artificial night light helps account for observer bias in citizen
   science monitoring of an expanding large mammal population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {1. The integration of citizen scientists into ecological research is
   transforming how, where, and when data are collected, and expanding the
   potential scales of ecological studies. Citizen-science projects can
   provide numerous benefits for participants while educating and
   connecting professionals with lay audiences, potentially increasing the
   acceptance of conservation and management actions. However, for all the
   benefits, collection of citizen-science data is often biased towards
   areas that are easily accessible (e.g. developments and roadways), and
   thus data are usually affected by issues typical of opportunistic
   surveys (e.g. uneven sampling effort). These areas are usually
   illuminated by artificial light at night (ALAN), a dynamic sensory
   stimulus that alters the perceptual world for both humans and wildlife.
   2. Our goal was to test whether satellite-based measures of ALAN could
   improve our understanding of the detection process of
   citizen-scientist-reported sightings of a large mammal.
   3. We collected observations of American black bears Ursus americanus (n
   = 1,315) outside their primary range in Minnesota, USA, as part of a
   study to gauge population expansion. Participants from the public
   provided sighting locations of bears on a website. We used an occupancy
   modelling framework to determine how well ALAN accounted for observer
   metrics compared to other commonly used metrics (e.g. housing density).
   4. Citizen scientists reported 17\% of bear sightings were under
   artificially lit conditions and monthly ALAN estimates did the best job
   accounting for spatial bias in detection of all observations, based on
   AIC values and effect sizes ((beta) over cap = 0.81, 0.71-0.90 95\% CI).
   Bear detection increased with elevated illuminance; relative abundance
   was positively associated with natural cover, proximity to primary bear
   range and lower road density. Although the highest counts of bear
   sightings occurred in the highly illuminated suburbs of the
   Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan region, we estimated substantially
   higher bear abundance in another region with plentiful natural cover and
   low ALAN (up to similar to 375\% increased predicted relative abundance)
   where observations were sparse.
   5. We demonstrate the importance of considering ALAN radiance when
   analysing citizen-scientist-collected data, and we highlight the ways
   that ALAN data provide a dynamic snapshot of human activity.},

Title = {Embedding ``Smart{''} Disease Coding Within Routine Electronic Medical
   Record Workflow: Prospective Single-Arm Trial},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Electronic medical record (EMR) chronic disease measurement
   can help direct primary care prevention and treatment strategies and
   plan health services resource management. Incomplete data and poor
   consistency of coded disease values within EMR problem lists are
   widespread issues that limit primary and secondary uses of these data.
   These issues were shared by the McMaster University Sentinel and
   Information Collaboration (MUSIC), a primary care practice-based
   research network (PBRN) located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
   Objective: We sought to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of new
   EMR interface tools aimed at improving the quantity and the consistency
   of disease codes recorded within the disease registry across the MUSIC
   PBRN.
   Methods: We used a single-arm prospective trial design with
   preintervention and postintervention data analysis to assess the effect
   of the intervention on disease recording volume and quality. The MUSIC
   network holds data on over 75,080 patients, 37,212 currently rostered.
   There were 4 MUSIC network clinician champions involved in gap analysis
   of the disease coding process and in the iterative design of new
   interface tools. We leveraged terminology standards and factored EMR
   workflow and usability into a new interface solution that aimed to
   optimize code selection volume and quality while minimizing physician
   time burden. The intervention was integrated as part of usual clinical
   workflow during routine billing activities.
   Results: After implementation of the new interface (June 25, 2017), we
   assessed the disease registry codes at 3 and 6 months (intervention
   period) to compare their volume and quality to preintervention levels
   (baseline period). A total of 17,496 International Classification of
   Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD9) code values were recorded in the disease
   registry during the 11.5-year (2006 to mid-2017) baseline period. A
   large gain in disease recording occurred in the intervention period
   (8516/17,496, 48.67\% over baseline), resulting in a total of 26,774
   codes. The coding rate increased by a factor of 11.2, averaging 1419
   codes per month over the baseline average rate of 127 codes per month.
   The proportion of preferred ICD9 codes increased by 17.03\% in the
   intervention period (11,007/17,496, 62.91\% vs 7417/9278, 79.94\%;
   chi(2)(1) =819.4; P<.001). A total of 45.03\% (4178/9278) of disease
   codes were entered by way of the new screen prompt tools, with
   significant increases between quarters (Jul-Sep: 2507/6140, 40.83\% vs
   Oct-Dec: 1671/3148, 53.08\%; chi(2 )(1)=126.2; P<.001).
   Conclusions: The introduction of clinician co-designed,
   workflow-embedded disease coding tools is a very effective solution to
   the issues of poor disease coding and quality in EMRs. The substantial
   effectiveness in a routine care environment demonstrates usability, and
   the intervention detail described here should be generalizable to any
   setting. Significant improvements in problem list coding within primary
   care EMRs can be realized with minimal disruption to routine clinical
   workflow.},

Title = {Clinical signs predictive of influenza virus infection in Cameroon},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Influenza virus accounts for majority of respiratory virus infections in
   Cameroon. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
   influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are identified by a measured temperature
   of >= 38 degrees C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days. Other
   symptoms could as well be observed however, none of these are specific
   to influenza alone. This study aimed to determine symptom based
   predictors of influenza virus infection in Cameroon. Individuals with
   ILI were recruited from 2009-2018 in sentinel sites of the influenza
   surveillance system in Cameroon according to the WHO case definition.
   Individual data collection forms accompanied each respiratory sample and
   contained clinical data. Samples were analyzed for influenza using the
   gold standard assay. Two statistical methods were compared to determine
   the most reliable clinical predictors of influenza virus activity in
   Cameroon: binomial logistic predictive model and random forest model.
   Analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2. A total of 11816
   participants were recruited, of which, 24.0\% were positive for
   influenza virus. Binomial logistic predictive model revealed that the
   presence of cough, rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia are significant
   predictors of influenza positivity. The prediction model had a
   sensitivity of 75.6\%, specificity of 46.6\% and AUC of 66.7\%. The
   random forest model categorized the reported symptoms according to their
   degree of importance in predicting influenza virus infection. Myalgia
   had a 2-fold higher value in predicting influenza virus infection
   compared to any other symptom followed by arthralgia, head ache,
   rhinorrhoea and sore throat. The model had a OOB error rate of 25.86\%.
   Analysis showed that the random forest model had a better performance
   over the binomial regression model in predicting influenza infection.
   Rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia were symptoms reported by both models
   as significant predictors of influenza infection in Cameroon. These
   symptoms could be used by clinicians in their decision to treat
   patients.},

Abstract = {Vegetation cover on the coast of Bahia de Banderas, Nayarit, has been
   modified and reduced dramatically in recent decades because of tourism
   development, so that the objectives of this study were: (1) generate
   information on the composition, richness, and structural values of
   species of trees, shrubs and woody vines and (2) define the spatial
   distribution and the current cover of vegetation. The field sampling for
   the floristic and ecological information was conducted in 60 plots of
   1,000 m(2) each; and vegetation cover map was generated from satellite
   images. 43 families, 92 genera and 127 species were identified. The
   families with the highest number of species were Fabaceae,
   Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae and Malvaceae; 59 \% of the species were trees,
   34.6 \% shrubs and 6.4 \% woody vines. Two variants of tropical
   deciduous forest and three of tropical semideciduous forest, which
   together occupy 36 \% of the total area were recognized. The species
   with the highest relative importance value in the tropical semideciduous
   forest were Bursera simaruba, Brosimum alicastrum, Couepia polyandra,
   Ficus obtusifolia, Hippomane mancinella, Attalea cohune, Piper aduncum,
   and Pisonia aculeata. In the tropical deciduous forest species with
   higher relative importance value were Bursera instabilis, Cochlospermum
   vitifolium, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Ficus cotinifolia, Haematoxylum
   brasiletto, Lysiloma divaricatum, Lonchocarpus mutans, and Plumeria
   rubra. The tourism and agricultural development, the presence of species
   in a risk category, and small surface with natural vegetation, indicate
   the need of implementing management and conservation programs in this
   area of Nayarit.},

Title = {Information systems for patient follow-up and chronic management of HIV
   and tuberculosis: A life-saving technology in resource-poor areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Background: The scale-up of treatment for HIV and multidrug-resistant
   tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in developing countries requires a long-term
   relationship with the patient, accurate and accessible records of each
   patient's history, and methods to track his/her progress. Recent studies
   have shown up to 24\% loss to follow-up of HIV patients in Africa during
   treatment and many patients not being started on treatment at all. Some
   programs for prevention of maternal-child transmission have more than
   80\% loss to follow-up of babies born to HIV-positive mothers. These
   patients are at great risk of dying or developing drug resistance if
   their antiretroviral therapy is interrupted. Similar problems have been
   found in the scale-up of MDR-TB treatment.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the role of medical
   information systems in tracking patients with HIV or MDR-TB, ensuring
   they are promptly started on high quality care, and reducing loss to
   follow-up.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted starting from a previous
   review and using Medline and Google Scholar. Due to the nature of this
   work and the relative lack of published articles to date, the authors
   also relied on personal knowledge and experience of systems in use and
   their own assessments of systems.
   Results: Functionality for tracking patients and detecting those lost to
   follow-up is described in six HIV and MDR-TB treatment projects in
   Africa and Latin America. Preliminary data show benefits in tracking
   patients who have not been prescribed appropriate drugs, those who fail
   to return for follow-up, and those who do not have medications picked up
   for them by health care workers. There were also benefits seen in
   providing access to key laboratory data and in using this data to
   improve the timeliness and quality of care. Follow-up was typically
   achieved by a combination of reports from information systems along with
   teams of community health care workers. New technologies such as
   low-cost satellite Internet access, personal digital assistants, and
   cell phones are helping to expand the reach of these systems.
   Conclusions: Effective information systems in developing countries are a
   recent innovation but will need to play an increasing role in supporting
   and monitoring HIV and MDR-TB projects as they scale up from thousands
   to hundreds of thousands of patients. A particular focus should be
   placed on tracking patients from initial diagnosis to initiation of
   effective treatment and then monitoring them for treatment breaks or
   loss to follow-up. More quantitative evaluations need to be performed on
   the impact of electronic information systems on tracking patients.},

Title = {The annual cycle for whimbrel populations using the Western Atlantic
   Flyway},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered
   across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that
   may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend
   their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult
   whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie
   Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the
   structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their
   use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta
   whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn
   and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and
   more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring.
   The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring
   staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground,
   arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring
   staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both
   populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring
   compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having
   fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory
   staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that
   were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high
   (98\%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations
   where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes.
   The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas
   are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high
   conservation value.},

Abstract = {Vegetation species maps are useful for forestry managements and
   environmental ecological study. From the forestry management, broad and
   conifer leaf forest should be mapped. In addition to them, land-cover
   mapping data with high resolution is needed as validation data sets for
   low resolution's land-cover mapping results. SGLI sensor on board GCOM-C
   satellite, which will be launched in 2014, has 250m spatial resolution
   and it's data will be used for making global land-cover data set. ALOS
   satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor and PRISM sensor.
   AVNIR-2 sensor has four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830nm with 10-m
   spatial resolution. PRISMsensor has panchromatic band from 520nm to 770
   nm with 2.5m spatial resolution. If use the both of image, pseudo high
   spatial multi-spectal image can be processed. Because of the spatial
   resolution and multi-spectral information, these sensor data are
   expected to useful for making high resolution land-cover data set. We
   have developed Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM)(Zhang, L.F.
   et. al, 2006 (Zhang et al., 2006)) and Modified Vegetation Index based
   on UPDM (MVIUPD)(Zhang, L. F. et. al, 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) and
   Xiong, Y., 2005 (?)) for satellite sensor data analysis for land cover
   mapping and vegetation monitoring. In the UPDM method, three
   coefficients of water, vegetation and soil is calculated using three
   standard patterns of water, vegetation and soil. One of this method's
   characteristics is the UPDM coefficients from different sensors for the
   same object being same as each other. The capability of vegetation
   species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR-2 data and UPDM method.
   Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest,
   orchard and grass land can be classified using AVNIR-2 summer and winter
   data. In this study, AVNIR-2 and PRISM data are used for vegetation
   types mapping using universal pattern decomposition method. Firstly, the
   pan-sharpen image was processed using AVNIR-2 and PRISM data. Each
   band's Digital Number (DN) value of AVNIR-2's band is calculated using
   DN of PRISM and AVNIR-2. The reflectance of AVNIR-2 is calculated from
   calculated DN values. UPDM method is applied to the set of re-calculated
   reflectance. Using the coefficients of UPDM and vegetation index,
   evergreen forest and deciduous forest were classified using two seasonal
   data. These results are compared with forest resource information. The
   tendency was agree with each other, although detailed validation is
   needed. From these results, the UPDM method can be applied to
   pan-sharpen image and the pan-sharpen image can be used for vegetation
   type classification. In the near future, calculation methods with
   retaining the original reflectance should be improved.},

Title = {Modeling the global distribution of Culicoides imicola: an Ensemble
   approach},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola is a midge species serving as vector for a number of
   viral diseases of livestock, including Bluetongue, and African Horse
   Sickness. C. imicola is also known to transmit Schmallenberg virus
   experimentally. E nvironmental and demographic factors may impose rapid
   changes on the global distribution of C. imicola and aid introduction
   into new areas. The aim of this study is to predict the global
   distribution of C. imicola using an ensemble modeling approach by
   combining climatic, livestock distribution and land cover covariates,
   together with a comprehensive global dataset of geo-positioned
   occurrence points for C. imicola. Thirty individual models were
   generated by `biomod2', with 21 models scoring a true skill statistic
   (TSS) > 0.8. These 21 models incorporated weighted runs from eight of
   ten algorithms and were used to create a final ensemble model. The
   ensemble model performed very well (TSS = 0.898 and ROC = 0.991) and
   indicated high environmental suitability for C. imicola in the tropics
   and subtropics. The habitat suitability for C. imicola spans from South
   Africa to southern Europe and from southern USA to southern China. The
   distribution of C. imicola is mainly constrained by climatic factors. In
   the ensemble model, mean annual minimum temperature had the highest
   overall contribution (42.9\%), followed by mean annual maximum
   temperature (21.1\%), solar radiation (13.6\%), annual precipitation
   (11\%), livestock distribution (6.2\%), vapor pressure (3.4\%), wind
   speed (0.8\%), and land cover (0.1\%). The present study provides the
   most up-to-date predictive maps of the potential distributions of C.
   imicola and should be of great value for decision making at global and
   regional scales.},

Abstract = {Assuring transfusion safety is an essential element of health care in
   all countries, requiring government commitment, national policy and a
   legal framework. Fundamental safety strategies include selection of low
   risk donors, Good Manufacturing Practices in preparation of blood
   components, and appropriate clinical use including avoidance of
   unnecessary transfusions Hemovigilance, including surveillance for known
   adverse events and sentinel reporting of unexpected adverse events,
   enhances safety through bench-marking to promote best practices and by
   enabling rapid responses to new threats. Preventing transmission of
   infectious diseases is a principal safety concern Selection of low risk
   donors includes use of screening questions to elicit risk factors known
   to be associated with transmissible infections. Laboratory testing for
   specific infectious disease markers is an established strategy for
   interdicting contaminated donations The sensitivity, specificity, and
   operational convenience of laboratory testing have improved over time
   and newer technologies are imminent. Donor screening and laboratory
   testing, while highly effective in reducing risk, cannot eliminate all
   risk from known agents and must be developed de novo to address emerging
   infections. In contrast, pathogen reduction technologies offer the
   possibility for robust inactivation of a broad spectrum of blood
   transmissible agents and provide an added safeguard against newly
   emerging infectious threats of most types. Current pathogen reduction
   methods also inactivate leukocytes, adding safety benefits similar to
   leukocyte removal and product irradiation. However, to date, concerns
   about the safety and efficacy of cellular blood components treated by
   pathogen reduction have prevented approval of these technologies in the
   U.S and Canada. FDA is promoting clinical and basic scientific studies
   to clarify these issues and would consider alternative approaches to
   assuring blood safety if pathogen reduction technologies are proven to
   be safe and effective (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {Background: The ADEBAR study is a prospective multicenter Phase III
   trial to examine whether high-risk breast cancer patients (>= 4 involved
   axillary lymph nodes) benefit from a sequential anthracycline-docetaxel
   regimen compared to standard chemotherapy with anthracyclines. With a
   median recruitment of 33 patients per month at 198 actively-recruiting
   centers, the ADEBAR study was the best recruiting study in Germany until
   the end of the trial. Materials and Methods: A standardized
   questionnaire was sent to all participating centers in order to
   determine the extent to which treatment strategies and patient care are
   affected by participation in the ADEBAR study. The questionnaire covered
   5 areas of interest: previous inclusion of patients at the same tumor
   stage in other studies, the type of chemotherapy received by comparable
   patients previously outside the study, change in the intensity of
   medical care since participating in the ADEBAR study, the information
   gained through participation in the study and changes in the overall
   quality of medical care. Results: 51.0\% (n=98) of the questionnaires
   were returned, from which 3 were excluded from the analysis due to being
   incomplete. In the year preceding the ADEBAR study, 63.2\% of
   participating centers had not entered their high-risk patients into a
   clinical trial. Before participating in the ADEBAR protocol, 44.2\%
   ofpatients with the same indication had received inadequate therapy by
   today's standards.. such as CMF, EC/CMF or 4x EC. 59.0\% of the centers
   noted an increase in the intensity of patient care as a result of
   participation in the study, independent of the care provided purely
   because of the study. By being part of a research network, with a
   regular flow of information via newsletters, study meetings and the
   like, 80.0\% noted an improvement in their professional knowledge in the
   field of breast cancer. Moreover, 31.6\% of the centers reported an
   improvement in the overall quality of their patient care since the start
   of the trial. Conclusion: The results of the survey demonstrate that
   both physicians and patients benefit from participation in clinical
   trials as this is associated with optimized decision-making as regards
   therapy and patient care.},

Title = {Using CHIRPS Dataset to Assess Wet and Dry Conditions along the Semiarid
   Central-Western Argentina},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)
   dataset was conceived as a tool for monitoring drought and environmental
   change over land. Recent validation efforts along South America have
   assessed its suitability for reproducing the main spatial and temporal
   features of precipitation. Nevertheless, little has been done regarding
   the ability of CHIRPS for the assessment of wet and dry conditions,
   particularly in areas where in situ precipitation records are scarce. In
   this paper, we investigated the performance of CHIRPS for monitoring wet
   and dry events along the semiarid Central-Western Argentina. Using the
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), we compared the CHIRPS database
   with records from 49 meteorological stations along the study area for
   the period 1987-2016. Results indicate that the CHIRPS dataset
   adequately reproduced the temporal variability of SPI on multiple
   timescales (1 month, 3 months, and 6 months), particularly in the region
   dominated by warm season precipitation. The large overestimation of the
   seasonal precipitation in the region dominated by cold season
   precipitation can introduce errors that are reflected in the performance
   of CHIRPS over the western portion of the domain. The frequency of wet
   and dry classes was accurately reproduced by CHIRPS on timescales larger
   than 1 month (SPI1), given the existence of a wet bias that produces an
   underestimation of the frequency of zero values. This bias is further
   translated to the evaluation of the SPI1 during the spatial and temporal
   assessment of historical dry (1998) and wet (2016) events, especially
   for the classification of extreme dry/wet months. The results from the
   evaluation indicate that CHIRPS is a suitable tool for assessing dry and
   wet conditions for timescales longer than 1 month and can support
   decision-making process within the hydrometeorological agencies over the
   region.},

   aerosols in the Arctic: implications for Arctic amplification},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 4},
Abstract = {Atmospheric pollution in the Arctic has been an important driver for the
   ongoing climate change there. Increase in the Arctic aerosols causes the
   phenomena of Arctic haze and Arctic amplification. Our analysis of
   aerosol optical depth (AOD), black carbon (BC), and dust using
   ground-based, satellite, and reanalysis data in the Arctic for the
   period 2003-2019 shows that the lowest amount of all these is found in
   Greenland and Central Arctic. There is high AOD, BC, and dust in the
   northern Eurasia and parts of North America. All aerosols show their
   highest values in spring. Significant positive trends in AOD (> 0.003
   year(-1)) and BC (0.0002-0.0003 year(-1)) are found in the northwestern
   America and northern Asia. Significant negative trends are observed for
   dust (- 0.0001 year-1) around Central Arctic. Seasonal analysis of AOD,
   BC, and dust reveals an increasing trend in summer and decreasing trend
   in spring in the Arctic. The major sources of aerosols are the nearby
   Europe, Russia, and North America regions, as assessed using the
   potential source contribution function (PSCF). Anthropogenic emissions
   from the transport, energy, and household sectors along with natural
   sources such as wildfires contribute to the positive trends of aerosols
   in the Arctic. These increasing aerosols in the Arctic influence Arctic
   amplification through radiative effects. Here, we find that the net
   aerosol radiative forcing is high in Central Arctic, Greenland, Siberia,
   and Canadian Arctic, about 2-4 W/m(2), which can influence the regional
   temperature. Therefore, our study can assist policy decisions for the
   mitigation of Arctic haze and Arctic amplification in this environmental
   fragile region of the Earth.},

Journal = {TROPICAL GRASSLANDS},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Little fire-related research has been conducted in the high-rainfall
   (>700 mm) Kimberley rangelands, but some extrapolation from studies
   elsewhere in tropical northern Australia can be justified. An increase
   in broad-scale early dry season burning is likely to reduce the extent
   of later more destructive fires while providing other benefits for
   cattle enterprises. Improved animal performance, and contributions to
   the maintenance of rangeland condition and biological diversity would be
   expected. In areas dominated by annual sorghum which escape dry season
   fire, burning during the early part of the wet season should be
   effective in reducing subsequent fuel loads, but effects on pasture
   composition should be monitored. There are considerable difficulties in
   implementation and evaluation of imposed fire regimes, especially
   outside fenced areas. Problems include the logistics of burning large
   areas within a restricted time, integration with mustering operations
   and control of post-fire grazing pressure. Collection of reliable animal
   performance data is hampered by very limited station infrastructure.
   Economic assessment of risks, costs and benefits of fire management
   options should be explored at a property level. Collection and
   application of fire history from satellite data is of crucial importance
   for research, monitoring and management. Urgent efforts are required to
   document the traditional knowledge of local Aboriginal people in
   relation to landscape fire.},

Title = {Estimating Canopy Density Parameters Time-Series for Winter Wheat Using
   UAS Mounted LiDAR},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Monitoring of canopy density with related metrics such as leaf area
   index (LAI) makes a significant contribution to understanding and
   predicting processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and to
   indicating crop health and potential yield for farm management. Remote
   sensing methods using optical sensors that rely on spectral reflectance
   to calculate LAI have become more mainstream due to easy entry and
   availability. Methods with vegetation indices (VI) based on
   multispectral reflectance data essentially measure the green area index
   (GAI) or response to chlorophyll content of the canopy surface and not
   the entire aboveground biomass that may be present from non-green
   elements that are key to fully assessing the carbon budget. Methods with
   light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have started to emerge using gap
   fraction (GF) to estimate the plant area index (PAI) based on canopy
   density. These LiDAR methods have the main advantage of being sensitive
   to both green and non-green plant elements. They have primarily been
   applied to forest cover with manned airborne LiDAR systems (ALS) and
   have yet to be used extensively with crops such as winter wheat using
   LiDAR on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This study contributes to a
   better understanding of the potential of LiDAR as a tool to estimate
   canopy structure in precision farming. The LiDAR method proved to have a
   high to moderate correlation in spatial variation to the multispectral
   method. The LiDAR-derived PAI values closely resemble the SunScan
   Ceptometer GAI ground measurements taken early in the growing season
   before major stages of senescence. Later in the growing season, when the
   canopy density was at its highest, a possible overestimation may have
   occurred. This was most likely due to the chosen flight parameters not
   providing the best depictions of canopy density with consideration of
   the LiDAR's perspective, as the ground-based destructive measurements
   provided lower values of PAI. Additionally, a distinction between total
   LiDAR-derived PAI, multispectral-derived GAI, and brown area index (BAI)
   is made to show how the active and passive optical sensor methods used
   in this study can complement each other throughout the growing season.},

Title = {Estimation of Full Dynamic Parameters of Large Space Debris Based on
   Rope Net Flexible Collision and Vision},
Journal = {ACTUATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The identification of space debris's dynamic parameters is a
   prerequisite for detumbling and capture operations. In this paper, a
   novel method for identifying dynamic parameters based on the rope net
   flexible collision and vision data is proposed, which combines the
   advantages of full dynamic parameter estimation (contact method) and
   safety (non-contact method). The point cloud data before and after
   collision is obtained by LiDAR, and the transformation matrix of point
   clouds and debris motion data are calculated by point cloud
   registration. Before the collision, using the motion model-based
   optimization, the real-time position of the debris center of mass is
   estimated. And the transformation matrix between visual and debris-fixed
   coordinates are calculated by the mass center position and
   transformation matrix of the point cloud. Then, using the debris dynamic
   model and parameters' characteristics, the normalized dynamic parameters
   are estimated. An identification method of net node position changes
   based on the flexible collision characteristics of rope nets is
   proposed, which is used to obtain the momentum of the rope net after the
   collision. Based on the conservation of linear momentum and angular
   momentum of the satellite-net system, the true values of the mass and
   the principal moment of inertia of the debris are estimated. The true
   values of the kinetic energy and momentum can be obtained by
   substituting the true values of the principal moment of inertia into the
   normalized parameters, and the full dynamic parameters of large space
   debris is estimated. Simulations of identifying full dynamic parameters
   have been performed; the results indicate that this method can provide
   accurate and real-time true values of dynamic parameters for the
   detumbling and capture mission.},

Abstract = {One of the challenges in using a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system
   is the long-term increase or decrease in underground temperature due to
   an imbalance between heat extraction and injection. To eliminate this
   imbalance, we proposed a hybrid GSHP (HGSHP) system combined with
   air-water heat exchangers (AWHEs) capable of year-round heating and
   applied it to the hot water supply for liquid natural gas (LNG)
   vaporization in a satellite station. In this paper, the authors
   demonstrate the year-round heating capability of the HGSHP system and
   the energy conservation benefits of installing the HGSHP system for LNG
   vaporization. First, a field experimental apparatus was constructed for
   a gas vaporization system with the HGSHP; thereafter, an experimental
   proof of gas vaporization was obtained. The experimental results showed
   that it was possible to stably vaporize liquid nitrogen that was used
   instead of LNG by supplying hot water at 25 degrees C. Additionally, in
   the gas vaporization experiment with the HGSHP system in the summer
   season, the SCOP measured was over ten. A calculation model for the AWHE
   was then established using the field test data; thereafter, a simulation
   tool for the HGSHP system was developed by combining it with one for the
   GSHP system. The simulation results indicated that the average surface
   temperature of all GHEs in the HGSHP system decreases from first year to
   second year. However, the average surface temperature of all GHEs
   stabilizes at a reduced level after the third year. These results
   indicate that the HGSHP system can operate long-term for year-round
   heating because the average surface temperature stabilize in the
   long-term.},

Title = {Experimental Evaluation of Smartphone Accelerometer and Low-Cost Dual
   Frequency GNSS Sensors for Deformation Monitoring},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Smartphone accelerometers and low-cost Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) equipment have faced rapid and important advancement,
   opening a new door to deformation monitoring applications such as
   landslide, plate tectonics and structural health monitoring (SHM). The
   precision potential and operational feasibility of the equipment play an
   important role in the decision making of campaigning for affordable
   solutions. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the empirical
   precision, including (auto)time correlation, of a common smartphone
   accelerometer (Bosch BMI160) and a low-cost dual frequency GNSS
   reference-rover pair (u-blox ZED-F9P) set to operate at high rates (50
   and 5 Hz, respectively). Additionally, a high-rate (5 Hz) GPS-only
   baseline-based multipath (MP) correction is proposed for effectively
   removing a large part of this error and allowing to correctly determine
   the instrumental noise of the GNSS sensor. Furthermore, the benefit of
   smartphone-based validation for the tracking of dynamic displacements is
   addressed. The estimated East-North-Up (ENU) precision values
   (sigma<\^{}>) of \& PLUSMN;7.7, 8.1 and 9.6 mms2 are comparable with the
   declared precision potential (sigma) of the smartphone accelerometer of
   \& PLUSMN;8.8mms2. Furthermore, the acceleration noise shows only mild
   traces of (auto)correlation. The MP-corrected 3D (ENU) empirical
   precision values of \& PLUSMN;2.6, 3.6 and 6.7 mm were found to be
   better by 30-40\% than the straight-out-of box precision of the GNSS
   sensor, attesting the usefulness of the MP correction. The GNSS sensors
   output position information with time correlation of typically tens of
   seconds. The results indicate exceptional precision potential of these
   low-power-consuming, small-scale, affordable sensors set to operate at a
   high-rate over small regions. The smartphone-based dynamic displacement
   validation shows that GNSS data of a low-cost sensor at a 5 Hz sampling
   rate can be successfully used for tracking dynamic processes.},

Journal = {BMC OPHTHALMOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Background The purpose was to describe the Nordic treatment practices
   and to reach a Nordic consensus for the treatment of sebaceous eyelid
   carcinoma. Methods The treatment practices data was collected by a
   questionnaire with 37 questions to the Nordic oculoplastic surgeons and
   analyzed. A PubMed MEDLINE database search was done to gather data on
   the published treatment practices and recommendations. A working group
   that consisted of in minimum one senior consultant from each leading
   Nordic University Eye Hospital was assigned. A structured interactive
   method was used to establish the consensus. Results Twenty-four doctors
   responded to the questionnaire. 23/24 (96\%) of the respondents took a
   biopsy before surgery. Regional lymph node scanning was routinely done
   by 14/23 (61\%) and a systemic screening of a metastatic disease by
   13/23 (57\%). 6/22 (27\%) never took conjunctival mapping biopsies and
   12/23 (52\%) never screened for Muir- Torre. Respondents used Mohs
   surgery, frozen section or multi-stage excision with delayed closure,
   and 5-6 mm was the mostly preferred margin. Sentinel lymph node biopsy
   was a possible option for 9/22 (41\%) and cryotherapy and Mitomycin C
   for 6/22 (27\%) respondents. 50\% of respondents considered radiation as
   a treatment option. 15/16 (94\%) respondents always followed-up their
   patients, most for 5 years. Two thirds scanned regional lymph nodes
   during the follow-up. Consensus was reached for 18 statements
   representing three domains: preoperative work-up, treatment and
   follow-up. Conclusion Treatment practices differ in between the five
   Nordic countries which have similar public health care systems. In the
   article the authors present a Nordic consensus for the treatment of
   eyelid sebaceous carcinoma.},

Title = {Effective management of slums- Case study of Kalaburagi city, Karnataka,
   India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-53},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As urbanization grows, we may expect that slums will tend to grow even
   faster. Kalaburagi is a second tier city and an important commercial hub
   for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region located in the north eastern part of
   Karnataka state. It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts
   and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth
   as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum
   population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11\% of
   city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable
   methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to
   advance the living conditions of slum dwellers.
   Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution
   satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed
   ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field
   photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented.
   As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA)
   model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The
   suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors.
   When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the
   final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding
   current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of
   slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been
   finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for
   developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums
   from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for
   selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS
   model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to
   enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective
   implementation of slum development programs.},

Title = {Numerical modelling of the responses of soil temperature and soil

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Number = {8},
Pages = {4134-4150},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Changes in soil temperature (ST) and soil moisture (SM) are essential
   for climate change and ecosystem assessments. Previous investigations on
   the ST and SM on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are mainly based on the situ
   observation and the satellite products. In this study, the improved
   Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), with proper parameter
   optimization and surface datasets update, is used to estimate the
   response of ST and SM in the TP to climate change in the long-term time
   series from 1961 to 2010. After validating the reasonability of the
   simulated results using the observations, the spatial distribution of
   changes in ST and SM in annual and seasonal time series since 1960s,
   1980s, 1990s, are investigated respectively and the changes of
   precipitation (Pr) and surface evaporation (Ev) are also analysed to
   understand the cause of changes objectively. As a whole, the soil was
   warming and wetting at the maximum value of 0.31 degrees C/decade and
   0.77\%/decade since the 1960s. However, the warming process in soil
   mainly occurred in the 1980s while the wetting tendency is detected
   since the 1990s extensively. Except for the influence of air warming,
   the enhanced Pr and Ev might also be indispensable factors that caused
   the intensive wetting process but damped warming process in soil. Summer
   is the favourable season for the thermal and hydraulic variation since
   the 1980s. There exists the striking warmer and drier trend in the
   eastern TP since 1980s while the colder and wetter condition in the
   western TP since the 1990s. The magnitude of variation in soil is
   magnified from 1990s under the continuing impact of climate change.},

Abstract = {The scientific-technological development is essential for the sustained
   growth of our regions; the production of quality goods with high added
   value is an important step forward when compared with the production of
   raw materials. Computational Mechanics is an essential tool for the
   development of new technologies and for the optimization of the existing
   ones {[}1].
   The industry faces technological problems increasingly more complex, and
   the numerical simulation of those technological problems induces
   scientists to computational developments of eater complexity. Since
   technological decisions are reached based on the results provided by
   numerical models, is evident that these models have to be highly
   reliable. Therefore, it is essential that sophisticated modeling
   techniques are used; that highly qualified engineers develop models and
   that the results are validated experimentally using industrial or
   laboratory determinations {[}2].
   The examples used to illustrate this article are taken from real
   applications developed for industry: the structural verification of the
   communications satellite ARSAT-1 and the modeling of rock fracturing

Abstract = {EMSO (http://www.emso-eu.org) is a large-scale European Research
   Distributed Infrastructure (RI) of the ESFRI roadmap composed of
   fixed-point, seafloor and water-column observatories with the basic
   scientific objective of (near)-realtime, long-term monitoring of
   environmental processes across the geosphere, biosphere, and
   hydrosphere. It is geographically distributed in key sites of European
   waters, from the Arctic, through the Atlantic and Mediterranean, to the
   Black Sea. EMSO will be the sub-sea segment of the COPERNICUS (former
   GMES-Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) initiative and will
   significantly enhance the observational capabilities of European Member
   States. EMSO is the European counterpart of many similar worldwide
   infrastructures, such as ONC in Canada, OOI in US, DONET in Japan or
   IMOS in Australia.
   EMSO ended its Preparatory Phase, EU Framework 7 funded project in 2012,
   and now is in the Interim phase transitioning to the formation of the
   legal entity for managing the infrastructure: the EMSO European Research
   Infrastructure Consortium (hereinafter EMSO-ERIC). A phased
   implementation will characterize EMSO site extension, construction and
   operation. The overall duration of the first phase of EMSO
   implementation will be 5 years from the ERIC foundation, with a review
   point scheduled at year 3.
   From the technological point of view, the most striking characteristic
   of observatory design is its ability to address interdisciplinary
   objectives simultaneously across temporal and spatial scales. Data are
   collected from the surface ocean, through the water column, the benthos,
   and the sub-seafloor. Depending on the application, in situ
   infrastructures can either be attached to a cable, which provides power
   and enables data transfer, or operate as independent benthic and moored
   instruments. Data, in both cases, can be transmitted real-time through
   either fibre optic cables, or cable and acoustic networks that are
   connected to a satellite-linked buoys. Cabled infrastructures provide
   important benefits such as high power and bandwidth for real-time data
   transfer when a processing of huge amount of data (as for bioacoustics),
   or a real-time integration with land-based networks (as for the
   seismology), as well as rapid geo-hazard early warning systems. Test
   sites have shown technological challenges to be faced and the potential
   for answering important scientific questions.},

Title = {Driving Factors of Land Surface Temperature in Urban Agglomerations: A
   Case Study in the Pearl River Delta, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) in urban agglomerations plays an
   important role for policymakers in urban planning. The Pearl River Delta
   (PRD) is one of the regions with the highest urban densities in the
   world. This study aims to explore the spatial patterns and the dominant
   drivers of LST in the PRD. MODIS LST (MYD11A2) data from 2005 and 2015
   were used in this study. First, spatial analysis methods were applied in
   order to determine the spatial patterns of LST and to identity the
   hotspot areas (HSAs). Second, the hotspot ratio index (HRI), as a metric
   of thermal heterogeneity, was developed in order to identify the
   features of thermal environment across the nine cities in the PRD.
   Finally, the geo-detector (GD) metric was employed to explore the
   dominant drivers of LST, which included elevation, land use/land cover
   (LUCC), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), impervious
   surface distribution density (ISDD), gross domestic product (GDP),
   population density (POP), and nighttime light index (NLI). The GD metric
   has the advantages of detecting the dominant drivers without assuming
   linear relationships and measuring the combined effects of the drivers.
   The results of Moran's Index showed that the daytime and nighttime LST
   were close to the cluster pattern. Therefore, this process led to the
   identification of HSAs. The HSAs were concentrated in the central PRD
   and were distributed around the Pearl River estuary. The results of the
   HRI indicated that the spatial distribution of the HSAs was highly
   heterogeneous among the cities for both daytime and nighttime. The
   highest HRI values were recorded in the cities of Dongguan and Shenzhen
   during the daytime. The HRI values in the cities of Zhaoqing, Jiangmen,
   and Huizhou were relatively lower in both daytime and nighttime. The
   dominant drivers of LST varied from city to city. The influence of land
   cover and socio-economic factors on daytime LST was higher in the highly
   urbanized cities than in the cities with low urbanization rates. For the
   cities of Zhaoqing, Huizhou, and Jiangmen, elevation was the dominant
   driver of daytime LST during the study period, and for the other cities
   in the PRD, the main driver changed from land cover in 2005 to NLI in
   2015. This study is expected to provide useful guidance for planning of
   the thermal environment in urban agglomerations.},

Title = {From urbanization to bioaccumulation: A comparative study of metal
   pollution and biomarker responses in Donax trunculus along a touristic
   coastal area in Morocco},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {This paper examines the use of the edible bivalve, Donax trunculus, as a
   bioindicator of metal pollution (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cr) resulting from
   beach urbanization related to touristic development in Morocco. The
   study aim is to conduct a two-year investigation to compare a period of
   moderate urbanization (2018) with a period of high urbanization (2019).
   Particularly, the study investigated the occurrence and bioaccumulation
   levels of metals in D. trunculus as well as the response of four
   biomarkers in this sentinel species. The results revealed that metal
   bioaccumulation in the studied bivalve increased due to the
   intensification of anthropogenic activities associated with
   urbanization, particularly for cadmium. Similar findings were observed
   for the metal pollution index, which reached higher values in the second
   year. Overall, the hazard associated with human consumption was not
   significant, however, the risk was more probable for children and during
   2019. In the second year, the examined biological endpoints demonstrated
   varied responses, including induction for glutathione-S-transferase and
   malondialdehyde, inhibition for catalase, and stability in
   acetylcholinesterase activity. Consequently, statistical analyses
   revealed a relationship between the bioaccumulated metals and the
   response of biomarkers. Further management considerations are required
   in the study area to minimize the occurrence and the risks of metals.
   Likewise, additional in situ and ex situ scientific investigations must
   be implemented to provide deeper findings about the sources,
   occurrences, magnitudes, and toxicity of metals in the touristic coasts
   of Morocco. \& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aims to assess whether research and development
   (R\&D) personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental
   institutions contribute to innovation activities of firms from the Vise
   -grad Group countries.Research Design \& Methods: Fixed effects panel
   regression with robust standard errors was used for hypoth-esis testing
   over the period 2009-2017. The data for the study was extracted from
   Eurostat, the European Innovation Scoreboard and the Organisation for
   Economic Cooperation and Development with a particular focus on R\&D
   personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental
   institutions. The empirical analy-sis was focused on small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Findings: The results provide evidence
   about significant linkage between R\&D personnel from governmental
   institutions and innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group
   countries. The research also highlights the lack of a significant effect
   of R\&D personnel from firms and the research system on firms'
   innovation ac-tivities in the analysed former Soviet satellite economies
   distinguished by innovation performance below the average for the
   European Union.Implications \& Recommendations: Policy and practical
   implications that should be indicated include the ne-cessity to further
   develop knowledge cooperation between governmental institutions and
   firms in order to reinforce innovation processes. There is also a need
   to enhance cooperation between the research system and firms to support
   SMEs from the Visegrad Group countries with highly-skilled human
   resources.Contribution \& Value Added: This article adds to the
   literature on drivers and sources of firms' innovation activities by
   providing new empirical evidence on the effect of R\&D personnel on
   innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group countries, which
   are former Soviet satellite economies with a moderate level of
   in-novativeness and belong to peripheral countries in the European
   Union.},

Title = {An examination of the views of key stakeholders on the development of
   learning spaces at a regional university},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the degree of
   alignment between the views of key stakeholders on the development of
   learning spaces in a new teaching and learning building at a satellite
   campus of a regional university.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were undertaken
   with six stakeholders including senior executives, technical staff,
   academic staff and students. The interviews were transcribed and the
   data analysed to identify common and differing themes on the part of the
   respective interviewees in relation to learning spaces in general, and
   in relation to the new teaching and learning building in particular.
   Findings - A comprehensive framework should be articulated by the
   university for its theme of personalised learning so that decisions can
   be made at lower levels of the university to operationalise the theme
   across academic and administrative functions. A clear definition of the
   blended learning pedagogy, which is proposed to be implemented as part
   of the personalised learning theme, should be articulated. The
   implications of the blended learning pedagogy for the design of learning
   spaces should be identified and clear design guidelines for learning
   spaces should be articulated. Learning spaces in the new building should
   be reviewed to achieve alignment with the personalised learning
   framework and the guidelines for learning spaces.
   Research limitations/implications - As this is a preliminary study with
   a small number of participants, a qualitative approach was taken to
   identify the indicative views of representatives of key stakeholders.
   The findings relate specifically to the context of this study at a
   regional Australian university.
   Originality/value - This paper provides valuable insights into how a
   university's philosophy on learning spaces manifests itself through
   creation and implementation of high-level policy and how that is
   interpreted and actioned by a range of stakeholders across campuses,
   including staff and students.},

Title = {Development of Fog Detection Algorithm Using GK2A/AMI and Ground Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Fog affects transportation due to low visibility and also aggravates air
   pollutants. Thus, accurate detection and forecasting of fog are
   important for the safety of transportation. In this study, we developed
   a decision tree type fog detection algorithm (hereinafter GK2A\_FDA)
   using the GK2A/AMI and auxiliary data. Because of the responses of the
   various channels depending on the time of day and the underlying surface
   characteristics, several versions of the algorithm were created to
   account for these differences according to the solar zenith angle
   (day/dawn/night) and location (land/sea/coast). Numerical model data
   were used to distinguish the fog from low clouds. To test the detection
   skill of GK2A\_FDA, we selected 23 fog cases that occurred in South
   Korea and used them to determine the threshold values (12 cases) and
   validate GK2A\_FDA (11 cases). Fog detection results were validated
   using the visibility data from 280 stations in South Korea. For
   quantitative validation, statistical indices, such as the probability of
   detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), bias ratio (Bias), and
   equitable threat score (ETS), were used. The total average POD, FAR,
   Bias, and ETS for training cases (validation cases) were 0.80 (0.82),
   0.37 (0.29), 1.28 (1.16), and 0.52 (0.59), respectively. In general,
   validation results showed that GK2A\_FDA effectively detected the fog
   irrespective of time and geographic location, in terms of accuracy and
   stability. However, its detection skill and stability were slightly
   dependent on geographic location and time. In general, the detection
   skill and stability of GK2A\_FDA were found to be better on land than on
   coast at all times, and at night than day at any location.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the evaluation of a skills-enhancement training
   series for direct service providers in home care that was part of a
   federally funded state-level initiative to improve employee recruitment
   and retention. The gerontological training curriculum included content
   to improve problem-solving, communication, and stress management skills
   in order to increase professionalism and self-efficacy. While the first
   year of training utilized a network of ``real-time{''} compressed
   video-teleconferencing broadcast to satellite sites statewide, these
   broadcasts were videotaped and accompanied by trained moderator-led
   scripted case study discussions at each of the sites during the second
   year. As the training series progressed, there was a linear increase in
   the likelihood that training would change the way participants performed
   their jobs in the future. Importantly, the training was more highly
   rated by the participants who had a greater commitment to pursuing their
   care work with geriatric clients. The merit of the program and
   implications of the results for the issue of employee retention are
   discussed. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Incorporation of the 40-Gene Expression Profile (40-GEP) Test to Improve
   Treatment Decisions in High-Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
   (cSCC) Patients: Case Series and Algorithm},
Journal = {CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {925-935},
Abstract = {Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has become a significant public
   health issue due to its rapidly rising incidence and an estimated 1.8
   million newly diagnosed cases annually. As with other cancers, treatment
   decisions for patients with cSCC are based primarily on a patient's risk
   for poor outcomes. There has been improvement in clinicopathologic
   factor-based risk assessment approaches, either through informal methods
   or ever evolving staging approaches. However, these approaches
   misidentify patients who will eventually have disease progression as
   low-risk and conversely, over classify patients as high-risk who do not
   experience relapse. To improve the accuracy of risk assessment for
   patients with cSCC, the 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) test has
   been validated to show statistically significant stratification of a
   high-risk cSCC patient's risk of nodal or distant metastasis,
   independent of currently available risk-assessment methods. The 40-GEP
   test allows for a more accurate classification of metastatic risk for
   high-risk cSCC patients, with the aim to influence appropriate
   allocation of clinician time and therapeutic resources to those patients
   who will most benefit. The objective of this article is to present a
   treatment algorithm in which clinicians can easily integrate the results
   of the 40-GEP test into their current treatment approaches to tailor
   patient care based on individual tumor biology. The following modalities
   were considered: surveillance imaging, sentinel lymph node biopsy
   (SLNB), adjuvant radiation therapy (ART), and clinical follow-up. The
   authors have contributed their own cases for discussion as to how they
   have seen the beneficial impact of 40-GEP test results in their own
   practice. Overall, clinicians can identify risk-aligned treatment
   pathway improvements with the use of the 40-GEP test for challenging to
   manage, high-risk cSCC patients.},

Title = {Perspectives on the opioid crisis from pain medicine clinicians},
Journal = {DM DISEASE-A-MONTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {64},
Number = {10},
Pages = {451-466},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Patients experiencing a terminal drug related event reflect a sentinel
   event. If this pharmacotherapy is a widely used agent, it may be viewed
   as a catastrophic problem. If patients are dying from illegal drug use
   when the medical establishment fails them by withdrawing or minimizing
   their medically prescribed medication, then the burden rests with their
   health care providers, legislation, and insurance carriers to actively
   participate in a collegial fashion to achieve parity. Causing a decay in
   functionality in previously functional patients, may occur with
   appropriately prescribed opioid medications addressing non-cancer pain
   when withdrawing or diminishing either with or without patient consent.
   The members of the medical profession have diminished their prescribing
   of opioids for their patients out of apparent fear of reprisal, state or
   federal government sanctions, and other concerned groups. Diminishing
   former dosages or deleting the opioid medication, preferably in concert
   with the patient, often results in inequitable patient care. Enforcing
   sanctioned decreases or ceasing to prescribe from their former
   required/established opioid medications precipitate patient discord. In
   absence of opioid misuse, abuse, diversion or addiction based upon
   medical ``guidelines{''} and with a poor foundation of Evidence Based
   Medicine the CDC guidelines, it may be masked as a true guideline
   reflecting a decrement of clinical judgment, wisdom, and compassion.
   This article also discusses the role of pharmacy chains, insurance
   carriers, and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) contribution to
   this multidimensional problem. There may be a potential solution,
   identified in this paper, if all the associated political, medical and
   insurance groups work cohesively to improve patient care. This article
   and the CDC guidelines are not focused at hospice, palliative, end of
   life care pain management. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning

Journal = {AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The Himalayan region, a rugged mountain zone is among the most
   susceptible zones to the landslide hazard due to its terrain, geography,
   and active tectonics. Machine learning (ML) techniques are most advanced
   and precise methods to develop landslide susceptibility model (LSM). The
   current study was designed to analyze and assess the landslide
   susceptibility using ML approaches for District Hattian Bala, NW
   Himalayas, Pakistan. The historical satellite imageries are used to
   generate spatiotemporal landslide inventories of year 2005, 2007 and
   2012. A spatial database was created pertaining to topographic,
   environmental, geologic, and anthropogenic factors including slope,
   aspect, elevation, curvature, plane curvature, profile curvature,
   topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, distance to faults, distance
   to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) and land use/ land cover (LULC). These LCFs were selected to
   analyze periodic landslide susceptibility in the region. The
   experimental design utilized 349, 393, and 735 landslide inventory of
   2005, 2007, and 2012 respectively. Two ML models, i.e., Random Forest
   (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to assess landslide
   susceptibility determine by thirteen landslide causative factors (LCFs).
   The spatiotemporal landslide inventory was partitioned into training
   (70\%) and testing (30\%) landslides for respective years to check the
   prediction accuracies of selected ML models. Comparative analysis of
   different LSMs was performed by the Receiver Operator Curves - Area
   Under Curves (ROC-AUC). The resultant accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Kappa,
   Precision, Recall, F1 indicated that RF outperformed the LR model. The
   study aims to minimize losses to lives and potential economic damage
   linked with recurrent slope instabilities in the region. It is
   anticipated that use of ML algorithms would support concerned
   authorities and organizations to effectively plan and manage landslide
   hazard in the region.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on

Title = {Animal-Borne Telemetry: An Integral Component of the Ocean Observing
   Toolkit},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Animal telemetry is a powerful tool for observing marine animals and the
   physical environments that they inhabit, from coastal and continental
   shelf ecosystems to polar seas and open oceans. Satellite-linked
   biologgers and networks of acoustic receivers allow animals to be
   reliably monitored over scales of tens of meters to thousands of
   kilometers, giving insight into their habitat use, home range size, the
   phenology of migratory patterns and the biotic and abiotic factors that
   drive their distributions. Furthermore, physical environmental variables
   can be collected using animals as autonomous sampling platforms,
   increasing spatial and temporal coverage of global oceanographic
   observation systems. The use of animal telemetry, therefore, has the
   capacity to provide measures from a suite of essential ocean variables
   (EOVs) for improved monitoring of Earth's oceans. Here we outline the
   design features of animal telemetry systems, describe current
   applications and their benefits and challenges, and discuss future
   directions. We describe new analytical techniques that improve our
   ability to not only quantify animal movements but to also provide a
   powerful framework for comparative studies across taxa. We discuss the
   application of animal telemetry and its capacity to collect biotic and
   abiotic data, how the data collected can be incorporated into ocean
   observing systems, and the role these data can play in improved ocean
   management.},

Title = {First satellite tracks of the Endangered black-capped petrel},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {23-33},
Abstract = {The black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata is an endangered seabird
   with fewer than 2000 breeding pairs restricted to a few breeding sites
   in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. To date, use areas at sea have been
   determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic
   sightings and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding
   of the species' marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of
   marine use areas, we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels
   breeding on Hispaniola, representing the first tracking study for this
   species and one of the first published tracking studies for any breeding
   seabird in the Caribbean. During chick rearing, petrels primarily used
   marine habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea (ca. 18.0 degrees to 11.5
   degrees N, 70.0 degrees to 75.5 degrees W) between the breeding site and
   the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the breeding
   sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period.
   During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used
   waters west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid-and southern Atlantic
   coasts of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic
   waters east of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites
   ranged from ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding
   period. Petrels used waters located within 14 different exclusive
   economic zones, suggesting that international collaboration will benefit
   the development of management strategies for this species.},

Title = {Digital mapping for cost-effective and accurate prediction of the depth
   and carbon stocks in Indonesian peatlands},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {272},
Pages = {20-31},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Tropical peatlands have an important role in the global carbon cycle. In
   order to quantify carbon stock for peatland management and conservation,
   the knowledge of the spatial distribution of peat and its depth is
   essential. This paper proposed a cost-effective and accurate methodology
   for mapping peat depth and carbon stocks in Indonesia. The method, based
   on the scorpan spatial soil prediction function framework, was tested in
   Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatra and Katingan, Central Kalimantan. A
   peat hydrological unit, where a peatland is bounded by at least two
   rivers, is defined as the mapping area or extent. Peat depth is modelled
   as a function of topography and spatial position. Four machine learning
   models were evaluated to model and map peat depth: Cubist regression
   tree, Random Forests (RF), Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) and
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Covariates representing topography and
   spatial position were derived from the 1 arc-second digital elevation
   model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (resolution
   of 30.7 m). The spatial models were calibrated from field observations.
   For model calibration and uncertainty analysis, the k-fold cross
   validation approach was used. Three models: Cubist, Random Forests, and
   Quantile Regression Forests models showed excellent accuracies of peat
   depth prediction for both areas where the coefficient of determination
   values range from 0.67 to 0.92 and root mean squared error (RMSE) values
   range from 0.6 to 1.1 m. ANN showed inferior results. In addition, QRF
   and Cubist showed the best account of the uncertainty of prediction, in
   terms of percentage of observations that fall within the defined 90\%
   confidence interval. In terms of the best predictor, elevation comes
   first. Using the spatial prediction functions, peat depth maps along
   with their 90\% confidence interval were generated. The estimated mean
   carbon stock for Ogan Komering Ilir is 0.474 Gt and for Katingan is
   0.123 Gt. Our estimate for Ogan Komering Ilir is twice larger than a
   previous study because we mapped the peatland hydrological unit, while
   the previous study only delineated peat domes. Finally, we recommend a
   sampling method for peat depth mapping using numerical stratification of
   elevation to cover both the geographical and covariate space. We expect
   that the combination of an improved sampling strategy, machine learning
   models, and kriging will increase the accuracy of peat depth mapping.

Title = {Why are we ignoring the relief? On the bias of planimetric instead
   topographic areas in ecological and spatial modeling researches},
Journal = {ECOSISTEMAS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},

Month = {SEP-DEC},
Abstract = {Spatial information, satellite products and their derivatives are
   important sources of environmental information. However, the accuracy of
   area and distance measurements is sacrificed by using planimetric
   projections and consciously ignoring relief irregularities, essential in
   ecological studies where the important estimate area is those perceived
   by organisms and the real surface of which resources density depend. In
   this paper, we assess differences in estimation of geographic areas
   accounting for or ignoring terrain topology, in ecological studies
   applications or distribution modeling, in Cuban archipelago. By using
   parcels and virtual species simulated distributions we assess the bias
   size in those estimations over a topological area derived from a digital
   elevation model, with 26.8m of spatial resolution. Underestimation bias
   can reach in Cuba up to 1598 m2 of differences, equivalent to 45\% of
   error. Errors are higher in mountain regions. We probe that equally
   planimetric size parcels can reach differences up to 15\%, depending on
   location and included proportions of relief types. Changes in potential
   distribution area estimates for virtual species present errors over 700
   km2. If using relativized values, the error diminishes. More studies are
   in need on the methodological impact of this bias, mostly for its
   implications for ecological conclusions or on its potential influence in
   management decisions.},

Title = {A Statistical Approach to Mapping Flood Susceptibility in the Lower
   Connecticut River Valley Region},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {54},
Number = {10},
Pages = {7603-7618},

Abstract = {Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region
   attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a
   quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors
   considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or
   flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial
   materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at
   point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within
   or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year
   Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley
   Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess
   the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between
   different region types; for each region flood risk factors were
   extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or
   outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were
   obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the
   greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal
   subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate
   in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood
   susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban
   regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional
   logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk
   (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and
   included several types of infrastructure critical for human health,
   safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic
   regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood
   susceptibility.
   Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and
   potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can
   come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding.
   Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term
   planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all
   critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas
   that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future
   is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such
   awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of
   regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to
   natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study
   estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River
   Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not
   related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood
   risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a
   statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent
   variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1,
   respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent
   variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to
   flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which
   sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk
   factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope,
   land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land
   cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to
   drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The
   objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent
   variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood
   event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It
   was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the
   LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current
   analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency
   Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate
   areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the
   SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they
   allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be
   estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify
   additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The
   LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to
   accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk
   factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between
   inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were
   randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor.
   An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were
   within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each
   flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location
   was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between
   each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that
   regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the
   magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk
   factor's influence on flooding in a subregion.
   It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most
   influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas
   distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion.
   The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase
   the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for
   each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all
   locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each
   subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of
   the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low
   risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very
   high risk (80-100\%). It was observed that several areas classified as
   very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several
   types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education
   were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets
   that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require
   additional flood risk mitigation.},

Title = {Impact of Atmospheric Correction Methods Parametrization on Soil Organic
   Carbon Estimation Based on Hyperion Hyperspectral Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Visible Near infrared and Shortwave Infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 400-2500 nm)
   remote sensing data is becoming a tool for topsoil properties mapping,
   bringing spatial information for environmental modeling and land use
   management. These topsoil properties estimates are based on regression
   models, linking a key topsoil property to VNIR/SWIR reflectance data.
   Therefore, the regression model's performances depend on the quality of
   both topsoil property analysis (measured on laboratory over-ground soil
   samples) and Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) VNIR/SWIR reflectance which are
   retrieved from Top-Of-Atmosphere radiance using atmospheric correction
   (AC) methods. This paper examines the sensitivity of soil organic carbon
   (SOC) estimation to BOA images depending on two parameters used in AC
   methods: aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the FLAASH (Fast Line-of-Sight
   Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes) method and water vapor (WV)
   in the ATCOR (ATmospheric CORrection) method. This work was based on
   Earth Observing-1 Hyperion Hyperspectral data acquired over a cultivated
   area in Australia in 2006. Hyperion radiance data were converted to BOA
   reflectance using seven values of AOD (from 0.2 to 1.4) and six values
   of WV (from 0.4 to 5 cm), in FLAASH and ATCOR, respectively. Then a
   Partial Least Squares regression (PLSR) model was built from each
   Hyperion BOA data to estimate SOC over bare soil pixels. This study
   demonstrated that the PLSR models were insensitive to the AOD variation
   used in the FLAASH method, with R-cv(2) and RMSEcv of 0.79 and 0.4\%,
   respectively. The PLSR models were slightly sensitive to the WV
   variation used in the ATCOR method, with R-cv(2) ranging from 0.72 to
   0.79 and RMSEcv ranging from 0.41 to 0.47. Regardless of the AOD values,
   the PLSR model based on the best parametrization of the ATCOR model
   provided similar SOC prediction accuracy to PLSR models using the FLAASH
   method. Variation in AOD using the FLAASH method did not impact the
   identification of bare soil pixels coverage which corresponded to
   82.35\% of the study area, while a variation in WV using the ATCOR
   method provided a variation of bare soil pixels coverage from 75.04 to
   84.04\%. Therefore, this work recommends (1) the use of the FLAASH AC
   method to provide BOA reflectance values from Earth Observing-1 Hyperion
   Hyperspectral data before SOC mapping or (2) a careful selection of the
   WV parameter when using ATCOR.},

Abstract = {Car use creates significant externalities for urban residents worldwide.
   City characteristics such as the configuration of the urban landscape
   and street network likely influence the use and attractiveness of
   automobiles, especially in rapidly urbanizing areas such as Latin
   America. The understanding of factors associated with motorization can
   inform planning measures to reduce car usage, and to promote healthier,
   safer, and more sustainable urban lifestyles. We harmonized official
   passenger vehicle data from 300 cities with >100,000 inhabitants in
   Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, and we calculated urban landscape
   metrics from satellite imagery and street network metrics from
   OpenStreetMaps. Analyzed cities had an average of 273.3 cars per 1,000
   residents in 2015 and showed an average car rate increase of 30 \%
   between 2010 and 2015. We used negative binomial regression to examine
   the association between car rates and urban landscape and street network
   characteristics, and linear regression to examine the association
   between the same characteristics and car rate increases. Car rates in
   the 300 cities analyzed showed a partial positive association with
   development fragmentation, and a consistent positive association with
   urban form complexity and circuity of the street network. In addition,
   the increase in car rates between 2010 and 2015 showed a negative
   association with population density. Implementing regional policies to
   reduce development fragmentation, to promote compact urban forms and
   less circuitous street networks may help reducing motorization in Latin
   American cities. Special attention needs to be paid to low density
   areas, where the increase in vehicle rates has been more pronounced.},

Title = {Mosaics of fire and water: the co-emergence of anthropogenic landscapes
   and intensive seed exploitation in the Australian arid zone},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN ARCHAEOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {2-19},
Abstract = {In arid Australia, the antiquity, role and ecological contexts of
   `firestick' farming in seed-based foraging economies remain unclear. We
   use Landsat imagery to analyse effects of contemporary Martu hunting
   fires on seed-bearing grasses and forbs. Today, Martu rarely harvest
   wild seeds but inadvertently foster patches of grass when they burn to
   hunt burrowing monitor lizards. Therefore, anthropogenic seed patches
   need only be by-products of fires set to achieve other goals rather than
   the intended crop of firestick farming. Nonetheless, sustained burning
   over the long-term creates and maintains closely juxtaposed mosaics of
   seed and small game patches. We use the marginal value theorem (MVT) to
   model how pre-contact foragers may have used seed patches within such
   mosaics in response to climate change and population growth. We show
   that seeds would have been reliably available to foragers in
   anthropogenic patches whenever small game hunting returns were low and
   travel distances to new hunting patches long. Such circumstances
   probably occurred during the middle to late Holocene when population
   growth filled better-watered habitats of arid Australia, and climatic
   variability associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   reduced the number of water sources that could support foraging.
   Prolonged occupation around the water sources that remained triggered
   the emergence of fine-grained, anthropogenic fire mosaics. If so, the
   late Holocene proliferation of formalised seed milling equipment closely
   followed the emergence of firestick farming and signalled the consequent
   development of seed-based foraging economies, further fuelling
   population growth and social complexity when more mesic climatic
   conditions returned. Earlier milling technology during the Pleistocene
   and early Holocene probably accommodated seed distributions created in
   fire regimes other than the mosaic burning conducted by Martu today.},

Abstract = {This article sets the stage for the ``25 Years of Food Security
   Measurement: Answered Questions and Further Research{''} conference,
   with support from the Economic Research Service of the US Department of
   Agriculture, by providing some history of federal food security
   measurement, summarizing notable findings, and reviewing selected
   special topics in analysis methods. The federal government uses food
   security surveys to monitor national progress toward reducing food
   insecurity and to evaluate federal nutrition assistance programs. For
   the monitoring purpose, there is a tension between focus (on a single
   authoritative measurement approach) and breadth (encompassing multiple
   tools or instruments suitable for diverse populations, contexts, and
   applications). For the program evaluation purpose, challenges include
   coordination with study designs capable of real causal estimation in the
   face of strong self-selection effects and tailored reference periods in
   survey questions that match the timing of program participation. Some
   analysis methods treat the food security survey items as distinct
   experiences of hardship, whereas others treat the food security survey
   items as windows on an underlying latent variable, a food insecurity
   score. The severity of food-related hardship may be assessed
   quantitatively by the number of distinct hardships reported, by the
   estimated value of a latent food insecurity score, or by the frequency
   of occurrence for sentinel hardships. Ongoing work investigates
   statistical approaches that are sufficiently simple for policy
   application and yet sufficiently flexible to accurately match the
   empirical survey evidence.},

Abstract = {Cooperative networks of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are
   attracting researchers because of their potential to enhance UAV
   performance. Cooperative networks can be used in many applications,
   including assisted guidance and navigation, surveillance, search and
   rescue, disaster management, defense, mapping, precision agriculture,
   and mineral exploration. Such cooperative networks of UAVs can act as ad
   hoc networks and share information among different network nodes. Such
   information sharing makes these nodes more robust and efficient for the
   intended purpose. The location of UAVs is traditionally determined using
   a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which limits the use of
   UAVs in regions that lack GNSS. However, the location of UAVs can be
   determined even in environments without GNSS through a cooperative
   network if a few of the nodes have access to GNSS. This is achieved by
   sharing the information among the nodes of the network. Information
   sharing in a cooperative network further results in improvement in the
   proportional accuracy of the nodes in cases where GNSS is available to
   all nodes. This study investigated a mathematical model and operational
   framework for cooperative localization of UAVs using GNSS,
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), inertial navigation system (INS),
   and UWB (ultra-wide-band) sensors under different architectures. This
   paper briefly discusses the practical feasibility of different
   distributed architectures and provides a comparison of distributed and
   centralized architectures. The study analyzed the proposed network using
   numerical simulation and investigated changes in performance with
   respect to different parameters. The simulation results show that the
   centralized architecture generally provided higher localization accuracy
   compared with the distributed architecture. It was also observed that
   reliable and consistent localization can be achieved, irrespective of
   the size of the network, by using a cooperative approach even if only
   four nodes have GNSS access in the network if there is good connectivity
   among the nodes. Further, the simulation results demonstrate that a
   cooperative approach benefits all the nodes in terms of improved
   localization accuracy even if all the nodes have access to GNSS. (C)

Abstract = {Albania's accession to NATO constitutes a unique history of special
   relationship. This appears evident when it has been taken in
   consideration that there is no country in the Alliance that can base its
   NATO policy on a public opinion consensus exceeding 90 \% of the
   population. Moreover, the history, population, culture, and
   geo-strategic of position offer a picture of a peculiar country that
   since the Italian Pelican and Alba operations in the Nineties has become
   a ``security provider{''} able to contribute worldwide to the major NATO
   and European Union peacekeeping operations. Few nations experienced the
   profound transformation accomplished by Albania, while playing a crucial
   role in supporting Allied efforts to and the humanitarian tragedy in
   Kosovo and secure peace in region. Albania underwent a unique isolation
   that ends after 46 in 1991. At that, time a multiparty democratic
   Parliament was established and Western freedom and values naturally
   become a common heritage of country ready to resume its role in the
   international community. In spite of dramatic events the stuck the
   Western Balkans during the Nineties, Democracy in Albania strengthened
   its roots and grew quickly, overcoming also some ``youthful errors{''}.
   This historical process required vision, leadership, and an
   extraordinary commitment on the part of Albanian population. The
   satellite antennas that doc the Albanian town testify to the longing for
   free and pluralistic information issuing from a public opinion that
   since the early Nineties has strongly supported the Euro-Atlantic
   integration process. Among the countries belonging to the former Eastern
   bloc, Albania was one of the first to apply for NATO membership. Since
   it has joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in 1992 (renamed
   Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997), the Euro-Atlantic
   integration has always been a major goal of all Albanian Governments and
   political parties. Looking back, the way paved by Albania toward NATO
   membership appears impressive: in 1994 Albania expanded its relationship
   with NATO joining the Partnership for Peace (PfP); during the same year,
   the Atlantic Council of Albania was established, bringing together the
   best representatives of the political, diplomatic, military, academic,
   and economic fields, as well as the new generations. In 1995, Albania
   developed the first Individual Partnership (IPP) and in 1996 the country
   entered the Planning and Review Process (PARP). In the same year,
   Albania forces joined the NATO-led SOFAR peacekeeping force in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina. Bilateral cooperation with NATO increased progressively
   in the light of the country's aspirant. In parallel Albania played a
   crucial role in supporting Allied efforts to end the humanitarian
   tragedy in Kosovo and in contributing to the stability of the region
   after the air campaign. On the occasion of the Washington Summit in
   April 1999, Albania achieved the Membership Action Plan (MAP) and become
   a NATO aspirant member country together with Croatia and FYR Macedonia.
   Since 1999, Albania was engaged in 8 MAP cycles and in April 2008 the
   NATO Head of State and Government meeting in Bucharest invited Albania
   to start Accession talks with the Alliance. NATO Allies signed protocols
   on Albania's accession to North Atlantic Treaty on 09 July 2008. The aim
   of this work is to do a preview of Albanian Armed Forces in contributing
   to all major NATO and European Union peacekeeping operations, ranging
   from ISAF to ALTHEA and from Georgia to Iraq.},

Abstract = {Rain-on-snow (RoS) events have caused severe floods in mountainous
   catchments in the recent past. Challenges in forecasting such events are
   uncertainties in meteorological input variables, the accurate estimation
   of snow cover and deficits in process understanding during runoff
   formation. Here, we evaluate the potential of the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF IFS)
   to forecast RoS disposition (i.e., minimum rainfall amounts, initial
   snow cover, and meltwater contribution) several days ahead. We thereby
   evaluate forecasts of rain and snowfall with disdrometer observations
   and show that ensemble-based forecasts have larger potential than the
   high-resolution forecast of ECMWF IFS. Then, we use ECMWF IFS weather
   forecasts as input to a conceptual hydrological model, which is
   calibrated using estimates of snow-covered area (SCA), snow water
   equivalent (SWE), and discharge observations. We show that the forecast
   skill of this model chain is reasonably high with respect to SCA and
   SWE, even several days ahead. However, a number of RoS events are missed
   in the forecast, mainly due to an underestimation of rainfall amounts.
   These misses can be reduced by lowering the rainfall amount threshold
   for the forecast as compared to the analysis, being accompanied by only
   a moderate increase in false alarm rates. In contrast, the forecast of
   RoS disposition is found to be less sensitive to thresholds of initial
   snow cover and meltwater contribution. We conclude that valuable
   disposition warnings for RoS events can be issued several days ahead,
   and we illustrate this idea with a case study.},

Title = {A design of real-time unipath polarization imaging system based on
   Wollaston prism},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {A real-time polarization imaging system employing the Wollaston prism
   and a single charge-coupled device (CCD) chip covering a wavelength
   range of 400-650 nm is proposed to avoid the false polarization
   information from dynamic scenes in non-real-time polarization detection
   imaging method. An architecture consisting of telescope lens,
   collimation lens, Wollaston prism, the imaging lens and a single CCD
   chip is employed in the system. The telescope lens is used to focus the
   incoming light on an intermediate image. And after collimation, the beam
   is angularly separated by the Wollaston prism. Two beams corresponding
   to ordinary light and extraordinary light are subsequently focused on
   the CCD plane via the imaging lens. The telescope lens is designed to
   have a telecentric structure in the imaging space, and the invert of
   which is used as the collimation lens, the completely symmetrical
   structure design is used to reduce the influence of aberrations. More
   abundant details from this system can be obtained by using matched image
   post-processing strategy, which is beneficial to high-quality target
   detection with enhanced working distance and improved environment
   adaptability. After joint-designing and optimization, the system
   modulation transfer function value at cutoff frequency is higher than
   0.55, and the root-mean-square radius of the system is less than 5.3 mu
   m, which is smaller than the pixel size of the CCD detector.
   Additionally, the lateral chromatic aberration of the system is much
   smaller than the diameter of airy disk, and the absolute values of all
   kinds of aberrations are kept smaller than 0.02 at the same time. The
   calculation results show that all the aberrations are mostly corrected.
   The system imaging is numerically modeled and analyzed, and it is
   demonstrated that two intensity images with perpendicular polarization
   states appear adjacently on the CCD plane simultaneously in the imaging
   simulation. One image is formed with the fraction of the backscattered
   light polarized parallelly to the incident light, and the other with
   light polarized orthogonally to the incidence, indicating that the
   expected design is accomplished. Compared with the traditional
   amplitude-split polarization imaging system, the proposed real-time
   polarization imaging system shows that the improved performance for
   real-time detection with promoted power efficiency, spatial resolution,
   and the light crosstalk in focal plane is well handled. Moreover, the
   joint design of the whole system can compensate for the distortion
   aberration in the vertical direction of the CCD detector, which means
   that a further improvement of image quality can be expected. The
   proposed system has a promising perspective in the fields of underwater
   imaging detection, astronomical observation, remote sensing, biological
   tissues inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Title = {Scientific and Islamic perspectives in relation to the Halal status of
   cultured meat},
Journal = {SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cultured meat is meat produced from stem cell biopsies of cattle. Stem
   cells were cultured in a bioreactor in the presence of serum to grow the
   flesh to maturity. Cultured meat technology originated from regenerative
   medical technology; however, it has been given a new lease of life to
   produce cultured meat as an innovative food source in the future without
   involving cattle breeding. This technology can reduce the negative
   environmental impacts of global warming, water use, soil, and unethical
   handling of animals. In the excitement of accepting this new technology,
   the halal status of cultured meat is in question, as it can be produced
   from embryonic stem cells and myosatellite cells, each of which can be
   disputed for their halal status. Additionally, the process of culturing
   and maturation of stem cells involves the use of an impure medium
   derived from animal blood. Thus, cultured meat is acceptable to Muslims
   only if the stem cells, medium and scaffold biomaterials used to
   manufacture it are from Halal sources and shall be in line with the six
   principles discussed in this study. The discussion is based on Halal and
   haram animals; Animal slaughtering; Not derived from a source of najs
   (impurity); Istihalah tammah (perfect substance change); Maslahah
   (public interest or benefit) and mafsadah (damage); and Darurat

Title = {AIRBORNE LIDAR IN SUPPORT OF COASTAL MAPPING AND HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING},
Booktitle = {GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {175-195},
Abstract = {Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play
   a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by
   recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and
   feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are
   being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to
   mankind is not fully acknowledged.
   The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France
   (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This
   trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely
   the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed
   a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas.
   Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the
   return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation
   with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system
   is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system.
   The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density
   reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are
   respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground.
   Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in
   integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of
   tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among
   which:
   - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the
   bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion
   and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone
   or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to
   shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal,
   transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been
   carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic
   models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont
   Saint Michel and Morbihan bays.
   - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and
   facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has
   been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites.
   By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne
   ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced
   describing sediment facies and habitat units to a high level of detail.
   Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the
   flooding frequency, a key driver to the presence of sea weed belts or
   salt marsh vegetation.
   - Coastal morpho-dynamics are concerned with understanding coastline and
   seashore changes under natural or human pressure. Natural events include
   storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal
   developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in
   shellfish fanning areas. Repeated LIDAR surveys would allow monitoring
   the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to
   risk management.},

Title = {Estimate of daytime single-layer cloud base height from advanced
   baseline imager measurements},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter to describe cloud
   state and is highly related to the vertical motions in the atmosphere.
   CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic
   analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from
   Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16)
   Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis
   (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine
   learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as
   GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16
   and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from
   the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard
   Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations
   (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class
   of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine
   learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine
   learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning
   technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH
   estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE)
   of 1.87 km and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) of 0.92
   before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low
   confidence (19.2\% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km,
   Pearson's r increases to 0.97, and 96\% of the estimates are within 2 km
   of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance,
   cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate,
   although all input features have positive impact on the estimate
   accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for
   clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy
   (Pearson's r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud
   optical depth {[}COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained
   in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds
   with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded.
   Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat
   measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of
   1.41 km and Pearson's r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian,
   CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with
   small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low
   clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are
   not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence
   with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65\% of cloudy
   pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH
   with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived
   from ABI measurements using this methodology.},

Abstract = {Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria loadings were tracked during the
   summer 2010 major flood event of the Rio Grande using the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model. This bi-national watershed
   spanning Texas and Mexico has loading from urban point source sewage
   outfalls and non-point source loadings from rangeland and agricultural
   areas located upstream of a urban centre (Laredo/Nuevo Laredo). Flood
   events represent a high risk for human health since bacterial loadings
   increased during the flood. Sampling during flood conditions is
   dangerous and therefore there are comparatively few studies that have
   examined bacterial values in rivers during flood events. Therefore, the
   safest way to obtain bacterial concentrations during a flood event is
   through hydrologic modelling. Significantly, the initial assumption of
   constant bacterial loading within the basin is not valid. As
   demonstrated by previous research there is a strong linear correlation
   between streamflow and E. coli values. The outcomes of this study will
   provide guidelines for users of the SWAT model to predict bacteria fate
   and transport during future flood events and will therefore assist
   communities in improving management of their water supplies. Finally,
   use of satellite precipitation data as primary input for the SWAT model
   potentially extends the findings of this study to areas of the
   developing world that lack ground monitoring of precipitation.},

Title = {Quantifying the Severity of Phytophthora Root Rot Disease in Avocado
   Trees Using Image Analysis},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Phytophthora root rot (PRR) infects the roots of avocado trees,
   resulting in reduced uptake of water and nutrients, canopy decline,
   defoliation, and, eventually, tree mortality. Typically, the severity of
   PRR disease (proportion of canopy decline) is assessed by visually
   comparing the canopy health of infected trees to a standardised set of
   photographs and a corresponding disease rating. Although this visual
   method provides some indication of the spatial variability of PRR
   disease across orchards, the accuracy and repeatability of the ranking
   is influenced by the experience of the assessor, the visibility of tree
   canopies, and the timing of the assessment. This study evaluates two
   image analysis methods that may serve as surrogates to the visual
   assessment of canopy decline in large avocado orchards. A smartphone
   camera was used to collect red, green, and blue (RGB) colour images of
   individual trees with varying degrees of canopy decline, with the
   digital photographs then analysed to derive a canopy porosity percentage
   using a combination of Canny edge detection' and Otsu's' methods.
   Coinciding with the on-ground measure of canopy porosity, the canopy
   reflectance characteristics of the sampled trees measured by high
   resolution Worldview-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery was also correlated
   against the observed disease severity rankings. Canopy porosity values
   (ranging from 20-70\%) derived from RGB images were found to be
   significantly different for most disease rankings (p < 0.05) and
   correlated well (R-2 = 0.89) with the differentiation of three disease
   severity levels identified to be optimal. From the WV-3 imagery, a
   multivariate stepwise regression of 18 structural and pigment-based
   vegetation indices found the simplified ratio vegetation index (SRVI) to
   be strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.96) with the disease rankings of PRR
   disease severity, with the differentiation of four levels of severity
   found to be optimal.},

Pages = {4001-4018},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to
   achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to
   the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study,
   three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting
   seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that
   was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on
   canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in
   intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards.
   A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for
   Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters.
   The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time
   elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system.
   The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In
   addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and
   row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum
   orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed
   significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was
   less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed
   on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the
   harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly
   effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was
   provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured
   orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective
   field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field
   capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in
   alley width for SHD olive harvester. A yield map was plotted using data
   that were acquired by a yield monitor, reflecting the yield gradient in
   spite of the larger differences between tree yields.},

Title = {A new European service to share GNSS Data and Products},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3, SI},
Abstract = {This paper describes the new GNSS data and product services that have
   been developed within the context of the EPOS (European Plate Observing
   System) European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), which is
   part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures. These
   services, optimized for Solid Earth research applications, endeavour to
   harmonise, and standardise Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   data collection and processing. They have been implemented by the
   members of the GNSS Data \& Products (EPOS-GNSS), one of the Thematic
   Core Services (TCS) of EPOS with the active support of national and
   pan-European infrastructures (in particular the Regional Reference Frame
   Sub-Commission for Europe (EUREF) of the International Association of
   Geodesy). The optimized use of data from dozens of diverse European GNSS
   networks, installed not specifically for geodynamic studies, created
   additional requirements from an organizational and technical point of
   view, the solutions for which we describe in this article.
   The data flows from data suppliers and analysis centers to the various
   TCS Data \& Product Portals are described, as well as their integration
   into the overall EPOS system. This is made through GLASS (GNSS Linkage
   Advanced Software System), a dedicated software package developed since
   2016, whose architecture and functionalities are detailed here. Time
   series and other GNSS products computed at the several analysis centers
   are described as are the quality control steps that are performed.
   Finally, several user cases are presented that demonstrate how different
   stakeholders (from data providers to scientists) can benefit from the
   efforts being carried out by the EPOS-GNSS community.},

Title = {Modelling biophysical parameters of Indian Sundarbans mangroves using

Abstract = {Mangroves are one of the important coastal ecosystems in the world and
   Sundarbans is one of the major blocks of mangrove ecosystem. Indian
   covers 40\% of the total Sundarbans mangrove area, while the remaining
   60\% is located in Bangladesh. For mangrove forest assessment and their
   sustainable management, there is need to estimate the forest
   biophysical/ structural attributes. The present study investigates some
   of the biophysical properties of mangrove vegetation of south-western
   part of Indian Sundarbans using L-band fully polarimetric Advanced Land
   Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture
   Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data and field observations. The backscattering
   coefficients for all mangrove communities of the study area were
   computed where the cross polarizations (HV and VH) showed better
   potentiality for discrimination of the communities. Biophysical
   parameters of mangrove forest trees were modelled using multiple linear
   regressions. Synthetic Aperture Radar backscattering coefficients and
   some of the biophysical parameters were used as independent variables
   for basal area (BA) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimations with the
   highest model R square value of 0.632 and 0.717, respectively. The
   validation root mean square error (RMSE) achieved in case of BA was 3.66
   m2/ha, while the lowest validation RMSE attained for AGB was 46.10
   Mg/ha. The methodology presented in the work may be applied for the
   entire Sundarbans (including both the remaining Indian part and the
   Bangladesh mangroves).},

Title = {A GIS Methodology to Determine the Critical Regions for Mitigating
   Eutrophication in Large Territories: The Case of Jalisco, Mexico},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Inadequate management practices for solid waste and wastewater are some
   of the main causes of eutrophication globally, especially in regions
   where intensive livestock, agricultural, and industrial activities are
   coupled with inexistent or ineffective waste and wastewater treatment
   infrastructure. In this study, a methodological approach is presented to
   spatially assess the trophic state of large territories based on public
   water quality databases. The trophic state index (TSI) includes total
   nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll A, chemical oxygen demand, and
   Secchi disk depth values as water quality indicators. A geographical
   information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatiotemporal
   attributes of the water quality data, in addition to spatially
   displaying the results of TSI calculations. As a case study, this
   methodological approach was applied to determine the critical regions
   for mitigating eutrophication in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Although
   a decreasing trend was observed for the TSI values over time for most
   subbasins (2012-2019), a tendency for extreme hypereutrophication was
   observed in some regions, such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area and
   the Altos region, which are of high economic relevance at the state
   level. A correlation analysis was performed between the TSI parameters
   and rainfall measurements for all subbasins under analysis, which
   suggested a tendency for nutrient wash-off during the rainy seasons for
   most subbasins; however, further research is needed to quantify the real
   impacts of rainfall by including other variables such as elevation and
   slope. The relationships between the water quality indicators and land
   cover were also explored. The GIS methodology proposed in this study can
   be used to spatially assess the trophic state of large regions over
   time, taking advantage of available water quality databases. This will
   enable the efficient development and implementation of public policies
   to assess and mitigate the eutrophication of water sources, as well as
   the efficient allocation of resources for critical regions. Further
   studies should focus on applying integrated approaches combining on-site
   monitoring data, remote sensing data, and machine learning algorithms to
   spatially evaluate the trophic state of territories.},

Title = {Feeding habits of the whale shark (<i>Rhincodon typus</i>) inferred by
   fatty acid profiles in the northern Mexican Caribbean},

Abstract = {Whale shark (Rhincodon typus, Smith, 1828) is an endangered species with
   anthropogenic pressures due to increasing demand of encounter tourism
   activities. Research efforts to identify management and conservation
   strategies for this species are needed. The Northern Mexican Caribbean
   is one of the most important feeding aggregation sites of whale sharks
   worldwide. In this study, Mexican Caribbean whale shark feeding habits
   are assessed by means of fatty acid (FA) signature analysis, a
   biochemical non-destructive technique widely applied in trophic ecology
   studies. Sub-dermal tissue biopsies of 68 whale sharks and samples of
   their potential prey (zooplankton) were collected during 2010 and 2011
   in two areas with high R. typus abundance. Zooplankton samples (n=17)
   were divided in two categories: mixed zooplankton (several groups of
   zooplankton) and fish eggs (> 95\% of sample components were fish eggs).
   FA profiles of whale shark tissue sampled between years showed
   significant variability; while there was no intraspecific differences in
   FA signature related to sex, size and location. FA profiles of whale
   sharks and their potential prey were dominated by saturated fatty acids
   (SFA). R. typus FA signature was significantly different from that of
   mixed zooplankton; on the other hand, whale shark and fish egg FA
   profiles formed groups with overlapping values and registered high
   levels of oleic acid. PUFA average 3/ 6 ratio on whale shark FA profiles
   for both years was below 1. Arachidonic acid (ARA) percentage was higher
   in whale shark biopsies (13.2\% in 2010, 6.8\% in 2011) compared to
   values observed in fish eggs (2.0\%) and mixed zooplankton (1.4\%).
   Similarity between FA profiles of whale sharks and fish eggs, low levels
   of bacterial FA found in R. typus biopsies, as well as whale shark
   feeding behavior observations in the study area, suggest that R. typus
   is feeding mainly on surface zooplankton in Mexican Caribbean; however,
   elevated ARA percentages in whale shark samples may indicate that this
   species has complementary feeding sources, such as demersal zooplankton,
   which has been reported in other aggregation sites. Results obtained
   contribute to the knowledge of the whale shark trophic ecology in the
   area, but are inconclusive. Further studies are recommended to evaluate
   whale shark FA profiles from different tissues (muscle or blood); also,
   broader information is needed about zooplankton FA signature in the
   study area.},

Title = {Landslide hazard and risk mapping at catchment scale in the Arno River
   basin},
Journal = {LANDSLIDES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {329-342},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present the methodologies adopted and the outcomes obtained in the
   analysis of landslide risk in the basin of the Arno River (Central
   Italy) in the framework of a project sponsored by the Basin Authority of
   the Arno River, started in the year 2002 and completed at the beginning
   of 2005. In particular, a complete set of methods and applications for
   the assessment of landslide susceptibility and risk are described and
   discussed.
   A new landslide inventory of the whole area was realized, using
   conventional (aerial-photo interpretation and field surveys) and
   non-conventional methods (e.g. remote sensing techniques such as DIn-SAR
   and PS-InSAR).
   The great majority of the mapped mass movements are rotational slides
   (75\%), solifluctions and other shallow slow movements (17\%) and flows
   (5\%), while soil slips, and other rapid landslides, seem less frequent
   everywhere within the basin. The relationships between landslide
   characteristics and environmental factors have been assessed through
   statistical analysis. As expected, the results show a strong control of
   land cover, lithology and morphology on landslide occurrence. The
   landslide frequency-size distribution shows a typical scaling behaviour
   already underlined in other landslide inventories worldwide. The
   assessment of landslide hazard in terms of probability of occurrence in
   a given time, based for mapped landslides on direct and indirect
   observations of the state of activity and recurrence time, has been
   extended to landslide-free areas through the application of statistical
   methods implemented in an artificial neural network (ANN). Unique
   conditions units (UCU) were defined by the map overlay of landslide
   preparatory factors (lithology, land cover, slope gradient, slope
   curvature and upslope contributing area) and afterwards used to
   construct a series of model vectors for the training and test of the
   ANN. Various different ANNs were selected throughout the basin, until
   each UCU was assigned a degree of membership to a susceptibility and a
   hazard class. Model validation confirms that prediction results are very
   good, with an average percentage of correctly recognized mass movements
   of about 85\%. The analysis also revealed the existence of a large
   number of unmapped mass movements, thus contributing to the completeness
   of the final inventory. Temporal hazard was estimated via the
   translation of state of activity in recurrence time and hence
   probability of occurrence. The following intersection of hazard values
   with vulnerability and exposure figures, obtained by reclassification of
   digital vector mapping at 1:10,000 scale, lead to the definition of risk
   values for each terrain unit for different periods of time into the
   future. The final results of the research are now undergoing a process
   of integration and implementation within land planning and risk
   prevention policies and practices at local and national level.},

Title = {An Improved Random Forest Model for the Prediction of Dam Displacement},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {9142-9153},
Abstract = {Dam behavior prediction is a classic problem in the monitoring of dam
   structure. To obtain accurate results, different researchers have
   established various models. However, the models of predecessors rarely
   studied the nonlinear characteristics of dam displacement data and the
   abnormal values of monitoring data. It means that abnormal values will
   contaminate data set, and consequently reduce the accuracy of model
   predictions. In this article, an improved Random Forest (RF) model was
   proposed for analyzing dam displacement prediction and was coupled with
   a sliding time window strategy. The proposed model is developed by the
   following steps. First, for the purpose of alleviating the time-lag
   effect of impact factor phenomenon, a sliding time window strategy was
   introduced into the RF model to improve the time sensitivity. Second,
   aiming to determine the hyperparameters, Grid Search (GS) was introduced
   into RF model to improve the global optimization ability. This article
   takes masonry arch dam in China as an example, and adopts the horizontal
   displacement recorded by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as
   the research object. The accuracy and validity of the proposed model are
   verified and evaluated based on the evaluation criteria. The simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed model could capture the long-term
   characteristics and provide better prediction based on short-term
   monitoring data. It also has strong robustness on the abnormal data
   series, has simpler structures and less parameters, and requires less
   time for model training, so it can be a potential tool for actual
   monitoring tasks.},

Title = {Urban heat island modelling of a tropical city: case of Kuala Lumpur},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {The steep increase in urban populations results in the spatial extent of
   cities expanding both horizontally and vertically. The climatic response
   of urban areas differs greatly to rural areas exposed to the same
   environmental conditions, with urban temperatures generally being
   higher, particularly in the late afternoon and evening. Coupled with the
   upward trend in global temperatures, urban heating can be classified as
   an atmospheric hazard that affects a high proportion of the population
   in some countries, which needs to be addressed through local and
   national government planning strategies. This study presents preliminary
   findings from a city scale urban climate model developed using the fast
   climate modelling tool ADMS-Urban for the city of Kuala Lumpur,
   Malaysia, which is known to suffer from substantial urban heating, and
   discusses the extent and intensity of the urban heat island in light of
   existing literature based on field measurements. The model has been
   configured to use surface characteristic data derived from land-use data
   as input, and through comparison with temperature variations derived
   from satellite imagery, the model is seen to clearly capture the spatial
   variation of temperature over the domain. The urban heat island
   intensi-ties predicted by the model are comparable to the values
   reported in literature. This study also demonstrates the strong
   relationship between temperatures and wind speed, which is generally
   much lower in tropical Kuala Lumpur compared to mid-latitudes, and the
   urban heat island intensity and nocturnal cooling. The future modelling
   studies should account for anthropogenic heating, for instance, from air
   conditioning units and traffic, which are important sources of heat in
   tropical areas, and expand more on building materials and morphology for
   a thorough appraisal of urban heating in Kuala Lumpur.},

Title = {Heterogeneous accountingisation Accounting and inter-organisational
   cooperation in home care services},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1080-1112},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the effects of the increased
   influence of accounting on core values and practices within the services
   providing home care in Sweden a public sector setting involving
   inter-organisational cooperation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case study data were obtained primarily
   through semi-structured interviews with managers and front-line staff
   involved in home care.
   Findings - When accountingisation is extended to include
   inter-organisational cooperation, a form of heterogeneous
   accountingisation occurred in the home care services: an internal domain
   (with a low level of accountingisation) could be differentiated from an
   inter-organisational domain (with a high level of accountingisation).
   When the accounting-induced disturbances intensified, there was a
   redefinition of core values. In the internal domain, core values of
   pensioner-oriented focus and flexibility during service delivery
   persisted. In contrast, in the inter-organisational domain, core values
   had the legal boundaries of the organisation as their central
   foundation, standardisation was emphasised, and inter-organisational
   work practices were defined as the other organisation's responsibility.
   The findings also extend the research on absorption groups by indicating
   the rise of a new type of absorption process. Absorption was not
   undertaken by a few individuals, specialist work groups or satellite
   organisations, as described in the literature; instead, all front-line
   welfare professionals were involved in absorbing the accounting-induced
   disturbances when performing their tasks.
   Research limitations/implications - This case study research is
   context-specific and the meaning and consequences of accountingisation
   may differ within the public sector because of the status and strength
   of professional groups concerned.
   Originality/value - To date, research on accountingisation has primarily
   employed an intra-organisational perspective. This paper analyses
   accountingisation in an inter-organisational setting.},

Title = {STUDY ON THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND DRIVING MECHANISMS OF NATURAL
   SYSTEMS IN THE GANNAN PLATEAU BASED ON TIME-SERIES NDVI-A CASE STUDY OF
   LUQU COUNTY},
Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {12},
Pages = {11351-11365},
Abstract = {Using Landsat-NDVI data, this paper explores the spatiotemporal
   variation and future trends in the NDVI of grassland in Luqu County from
   1990-2017 and analyzes the driving mechanisms of the process via trend
   analysis, the Hurst index, and partial correlation analysis. It is found
   that (1) the grassland NDVI in Luqu County fluctuated greatly from 1990
   to 2017, and there were three time periods when the mean grassland NDVI
   decreased, from 1994 to 2000, from 2001 to 2007, and from 2015 to 2017,
   while from 2007 to 2015 the mean grassland NDVI in Luqu County slowly
   increased; (2) in Luqu County, the overall NDVI pattern of grassland
   shows the distribution characteristics of low in the central and
   southwestern regions and high in the northern and eastern regions, with
   the central low value area mainly located in the area of East Karshen
   Mountain south of Gaxiu Village of Gahai Township, the southwestern low
   value area mainly located in the border area with Maqu County, and the
   high value area located in the northern part of Luqu County and the
   Taohe River Basin in the east. Vegetation distribution becomes sparser
   as elevation increases. The mean NDVI value of grassland in the area
   above 3,800 meters above sea level gradually decreases; (3) the overall
   fractional vegetation cover of grassland in Luqu County shows an
   increasing trend, and the area distribution showing increasing trends,
   decreasing trends, and no significant changes accounts for 81.4\%,
   15.34\%, and 3.26\%, respectively. From the spatial distribution
   characteristics, the areas with significant decreases are mainly
   distributed around Gahai Lake, Luqu County, the scenic spot of Zecha
   Stone Forest, Gahai Township of National Highway 213, and the area
   around the transit section of Langmusi Township; (4) the reverse
   characteristics of grass vegetation change in Luqu County are stronger
   than the same-direction characteristics, and the areas with strong
   reverse characteristics are larger than the areas with strong
   same-direction characteristics. Therefore, in the future, the grassland
   NDVI in Luqu County will be under pressure of continuous deterioration;
   (5) precipitation and temperature are the main influencing factors of
   the grassland NDVI in Luqu County. The fluctuation in precipitation
   leads to the fluctuation in grassland coverage, and the increase in
   temperature has a negative impact on the grassland NDVI in Luqu County;
   (6) human activities have a two-way impact on the grassland NDVI in Luqu
   County. The growth in the number of local residents and foreign
   tourists, the expansion of builtup land, overgrazing, and industrial
   development have had a negative impact on the grassland NDVI. On the
   other hand, policy factors have played a positive role in the evolution
   of grassland coverage since 1990, especially a series of policies to
   promote grassland ecological protection and sustainable development.
   Cultivating grass for livestock, returning grazing to grass, ecological
   protection, herders' settlement, and ecological rewards and subsidies,
   have greatly improved the relationship between grassland residents and
   the grassland.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the issue of assessing the impact of subsidies
   provided from EU funds. The aim is to evaluate how and whether it can be
   captured impacts of subsidies provided in general. The example of
   subsidies provided was chosen through the Operational Program Enterprise
   and Innovation for Competitiveness, which is mainly used by private
   sector enterprises. A complicating factor is the fact that subsidies are
   always provided for a longer period of time. For this reason, analysis
   through time trends is difficult to implement. Therefore, rather
   space-based analysis was used, comparing the values of subsidies drawn
   among individual regions. For analysis, correspondence analysis was
   chosen, which allows to capture the predominant character of subsidies
   provided (here according to the most frequently drawn volume of provided
   support). It was necessary to categorize, which on the one hand more
   generalized the analyzed data. At the same time, it allowed to eliminate
   the impact of extreme subsidies in terms of their amount. The results
   were further compared with the values of the selected statistical
   indicators that relate to the respective support areas. However, on the
   basis of this approach, the impact that would be visibly reflected in
   the region's economic situation has not been proven.},

Title = {Assessing forest growth across southwestern Oregon under a range of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With improvements in mapping regional distributions of vegetation using
   satellite-derived information, there is an increasing interest in the
   assessment of current limitations on forest growth and in making
   projections of how productivity may be altered in response to changing
   climatic conditions and management policies. We utilised a simplified
   physiologically based process model (3-PG) across a 54000 km(2)
   mountainous region of southwestern Oregon, USA, to evaluate the degree
   to which maximum periodic mean annual increment (PAI) of forests could
   be predicted at a set of 448 forest inventory plots. The survey data
   were pooled into six broad forest types (coastal rain forest, interior
   coast range forest, mixed conifer, dry-site Douglas-fir, subalpine
   forest, and pine forest) and compared to the 3-PG predictions at a
   spatial resolution of 1 km(2). We found good agreement (r(2) = 0.84)
   between mean PAI values of forest productivity for the six forest types
   with those obtained from field surveys. With confidence at this broader
   level of integration, we then ran model simulations to evaluate the
   constraints imposed by (i) soil fertility under current climatic
   conditions, (ii) the effect of doubling monthly precipitation across the
   region, and (iii) a widely used climatic change scenario that involves
   modifications in monthly mean temperatures and precipitation, as well as
   a doubling in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These analyses showed that
   optimum soil fertility would more than double growth, with the greatest
   response in the subalpine type and the least increase in the coastal
   rain forests. Doubling the precipitation increased productivity in the
   pine type (> 50\%) with reduced responses elsewhere. The climate change
   scenario with doubled atmospheric CO2 increased growth by 50\% on
   average across all forest types, primarily as a result of a projected
   33\% increase in photosynthetic capacity. This modelling exercise
   indicates that, at a regional scale, a general relationship exists
   between simulated maximum leaf area index and maximum aboveground
   growth, supporting the contention that satellite-derived estimates of
   leaf area index may be good measures of the potential productivity of
   temperate evergreen forests.},

Abstract = {Intensive anthropogenic activities along the coastal plains of Andhra
   Pradesh (such as urbanisation, agriculture and aquaculture) rely
   extensively on coastal fresh groundwater resources that are pumped at
   unsustainable rates causing groundwater decline and water quality
   problems due to saline water intrusion. Hydrogeological studies are
   imperative to implement groundwater conservation strategies in coastal
   Andhra Pradesh, which is experiencing a severe freshwater shortage due
   to overexploitation and saline water intrusion as well as clean water
   loss through the aquifer system close to the coastal plains. An attempt
   is made in this study to demarcate the submarine groundwater discharge
   (SGD) and saline water intrusion (SWI) zones adopting a three-tier
   validation system, i.e. groundwater dynamic, LANDSAT resultant sea
   surface temperature (SST) variance and site-specific water
   characteristics along the southeast coast of Andhra Pradesh, India. A
   total of 234 water samples (139 porewater, 31 groundwater and 64
   seawater samples) were evaluated along similar to 450 km southeast
   coastline of Andhra Pradesh. In situ porewater physio-chemical
   parameters, i.e. EC, TDS, pH, DO, temperature, and salinity, at every 1
   km except non-accessible areas and groundwater for every 5 km were
   analysed and used for identification of SGD zones in the study area. The
   hydraulic gradient values vary from - 11 to 250 m in post-monsoon and -
   14 to 250 m in pre-monsoon. And sea surface temperature anomaly for
   2017, 2018 and 2019 varies between 21-39 degrees C, 15-34 degrees C and
   20-39 degrees C. Three districts out of the four districts studied
   (Krishna, Guntur and Nellore) were shown to be prone to SWI, whereas
   Prakasam district was susceptible for SGD. For the first time, this kind
   of preliminary study was carried out in the coastal Andhra Pradesh
   region, and it will serve as a basis for the meticulous analysis of the
   fresh and saline water mixing zones/process as well as to develop and
   manage the groundwater resources along the water-stressed coastal plains
   of Andhra Pradesh, India.},

Title = {Seasonal Food Web Dynamics in the Antarctic Benthos of Tethys Bay (Ross
   Sea): Implications for Biodiversity Persistence Under Different Seasonal
   Sea-Ice Coverage},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Determining food web architecture and its seasonal cycles is a
   precondition for making predictions about Antarctic marine biodiversity
   under varying climate change scenarios. However, few scientific data
   concerning Antarctic food web structure, the species playing key roles
   in web stability and the community responses to changes in sea-ice
   dynamics are available. Based on C and N stable isotope analysis, we
   describe Antarctic benthic food webs and the diet of species occurring
   in shallow waters (Tethys Bay, Ross Sea) before and after seasonal
   sea-ice break-up. We hypothesized that the increased availability of
   primary producers (sympagic algae) following sea-ice break-up affects
   the diet of species and thus food web architecture. Basal resources had
   distinct isotopic signatures that did not change after sea-ice break-up,
   enabling a robust description of consumer diets based on Bayesian mixing
   models. Sympagic algae had the highest delta C-13 (similar to-14 parts
   per thousand) and red macroalgae the lowest (similar to-37 parts per
   thousand). Consumer isotopic niches and signatures changed after sea-ice
   break-up, reflecting the values of sympagic algae. Differences in food
   web topology were also observed. The number of taxa and the number of
   links per taxon were higher before the thaw than after it. After sea-ice
   break-up, sympagic inputs allowed consumers to specialize on abundant
   resources at lower trophic levels. Foraging optimization by consumers
   led to a simpler food web, with lower potential competition and shorter
   food chains. However, basal resources and Antarctic species such as the
   bivalve Adamussium colbecki and the sea-urchin Sterechinus neumayeri
   were central and highly connected both before and after the seaice
   break-up, thus playing key roles in interconnecting species and
   compartments in the web. Any disturbance affecting these species is
   expected to have cascading effects on the entire food web. The seasonal
   break-up of sea ice in Antarctica ensures the availability of resources
   that are limiting for coastal communities for the rest of the year.
   Identification of species playing a key role in regulating food web
   structure in relation to seasonal sea-ice dynamics, which are expected
   to change with global warming, is central to understanding how these
   communities will respond to climate change.},

Title = {The Effects of Urban Warming on Herbivore Abundance and Street Tree
   Condition},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Trees are essential to urban habitats because they provide services that
   benefit the environment and improve human health. Unfortunately, urban
   trees often have more herbivorous insect pests than rural trees but the
   mechanisms and consequences of these infestations are not well
   documented. Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a
   scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) (Hemiptera:
   Diaspididae), on one of the most commonly planted street trees in the
   eastern U. S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature
   are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban
   street trees. Although trees in the warmest urban sites grew the most,
   they were more water stressed and in worse condition than trees in
   cooler sites. Our analyses indicate that visible declines in tree
   condition were best explained by scale-insect infestation rather than
   temperature. To test the broader relevance of these results, we extend
   our analysis to a database of more than 2700 Raleigh, US street trees.
   Plotting these trees on a Landsat thermal image of Raleigh, we found
   that warmer sites had over 70\% more trees in poor condition than those
   in cooler sites. Our results support previous studies linking warmer
   urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to
   show its effect on street tree condition. Our results suggest that
   street tree condition and ecosystem services may decline as urban
   expansion and global warming exacerbate the urban heat island effect.
   Although our non-probability sampling method limits our scope of
   inference, our results present a gloomy outlook for urban forests and
   emphasize the need for management tools. Existing urban tree inventories
   and thermal maps could be used to identify species that would be most
   suitable for urban conditions.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {724-735},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land
   cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage
   are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to
   maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be
   considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring
   habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the
   connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index
   (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for
   restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances
   among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas
   surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of
   probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds
   and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting
   SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao
   Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images
   for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land
   cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the
   SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also
   a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover
   category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover
   category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban
   (10.6\%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4\%). Although the
   land cover class ``wood sites{''} increased, the data of SIR revealed
   that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both
   decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor
   increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions
   where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able
   to use this model to determine local patches of high value for
   conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects.

Abstract = {The small pelagic fishery in the southern Philippines is one of the
   largest contributors to fisheries production in the country, and is
   dominated by the Bali sardine Sardinella lemuru. This species is a
   year-round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the
   northeast monsoon (NEM) months of November to February. However, there
   is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species'
   survival during its early life history stages. Here, we attempt to
   discern the importance of temperature, prey density and advection on
   sardine larvae. The larvae were represented as passive particles that
   were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal. The
   conditions the larvae experienced, namely, temperature and estimated
   prey density based on satellite chlorophyll-a values were recorded at
   each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days. The
   temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed
   that sardines spawned during the NEM months experienced higher
   chlorophyll-a, lower (more optimal) sea surface temperature, albeit
   higher advective loss, than sardines spawned during other months.
   Comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch
   years, sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher
   retention nearshore. Our results emphasize that sardine stock management
   efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable
   sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently
   in catches.},

Abstract = {During recent years, growing exploration of natural resources and
   development of transport routes have reemerged the Arctic as a scene for
   political and economic collaboration between Nordic and non-regional
   states. When China announced its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), most of
   the attention focused on the joint building of transportation
   infrastructure across the Eurasian landmass (Silk Road Economic Belt)
   and the Indian Ocean (Maritime Silk Road). With the release of the
   Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the BRI, China incorporated the
   Arctic shipping lanes into the BRI transport network. However, an
   extension of the economic corridors to the Arctic is viable only in case
   of development of satellite trade, production, and research
   opportunities along the potential transport routes. In the Arctic, such
   opportunities exist but are limited due to the underdeveloped
   infrastructure, lack of reliable technologies, and severe climate
   conditions. In this study, the author discusses the critical points in
   the implementation of China's paradigm of collaboration and connectivity
   in the Arctic, as well as focus on the promotion of bilateral win-to-win
   investment and trade projects with the countries along the potential
   Arctic Blue Economic Corridor (ABEC). It is concluded that the ABEC may
   be efficiently incorporated into the BRI network, and European countries
   may receive substantial benefits from involvement in China's northern
   initiatives. The author emphasizes specific technological and economic
   challenges which have to be considered and met before a sustainable
   connectivity between Europe and Asia is established in the North.},

Title = {Managing Water Level for Large Migratory Fish at the Poyang Lake Outlet:
   Implications Based on Habitat Suitability and Connectivity},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {River-lake interaction is important for maintaining biodiversity, yet it
   is vulnerable to hydrological alteration. The connectivity of the
   channel connecting Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River not only ensures
   the regular migration of fish but also makes Poyang Lake a feeding and
   fattening ground for them. Unfortunately, human activities have
   dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions of Poyang Lake, which
   is experiencing severe drought due to the obvious decline in the water
   level in autumn and winter, especially since 2003. However, the possible
   impacts of the changes in the water level on the habitats of migratory
   fish remain unclear due to the limitation of traditional techniques in
   spatiotemporal analysis. Here, we combined a hydrodynamic model and
   habitat suitability model to simulate variations in the suitable habitat
   area and their connectivity under different water-level conditions. The
   conditions for the migration pathway of the target fish were obtained by
   a hydroacoustic survey using the Simrad EY60 echosounder. The results
   showed that the change in water level will significantly affect the
   spatiotemporal change in the suitable habitats and their connectivity.
   In particular, we found the existence of two thresholds that play a
   dominant role in illuminating the connectivity of effective suitable
   habitats (HC). Firstly, the maximum value of the weighted usable area
   (WUA) and HC can be achieved when the water level is more than 16 m.
   Secondly, when the water level is between 10 and 16 m, the changes in
   the HC are sensitive and rapid, and the area flooded at this stage is
   called the sensitive area. HC is a crucial element in fish migration and
   habitat conditions. Under the condition of continuous drought in the
   middle reaches of the Yangtze River, our research contributes to
   clarifying the influence of water level on key habitats for fish and
   optimizes the practice of river-lake ecological management.},

Abstract = {Background: Parents of young athletes play a major role in the
   identification and management of sports-related concussions. However,
   they are often unaware of the consequences of concussions and
   recommended management techniques.
   Hypothesis: This study quantitatively assessed parental understanding of
   concussions to identify specific populations in need of additional
   education. We predicted that parents with increased education and prior
   sports- and concussion-related experience would have more knowledge and
   safer attitudes toward concussions.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: Participants were parents of children brought to a pediatric
   hospital and 4 satellite clinics for evaluation of orthopaedic injuries.
   Participants completed a validated questionnaire that assessed knowledge
   of concussion symptoms, attitudes regarding diagnosis and return-to-play
   guidelines, and previous sports-and concussion-related experience.
   Results: Over 8 months, 214 parents completed surveys. Participants
   scored an average of 18.4 (possible, 0-25) on the Concussion Knowledge
   Index and 63.1 (possible, 15-75) on the Concussion Attitude Index.
   Attitudes were safest among white women, and knowledge increased with
   income and education levels. Previous sports experience did not affect
   knowledge or attitudes, but parents who reported experiencing an
   undiagnosed concussion had significantly better concussion knowledge
   than those who did not.
   Conclusion: Parents with low income and education levels may benefit
   from additional concussion-related education.},

Title = {Initial skill assessment of the California Harmful Algae Risk Mapping
   (C-HARM) system},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Toxic algal events are an annual burden on aquaculture and coastal
   ecosystems of California. The threat of domoic acid (DA) toxicity to
   human and wildlife health is the dominant harmful algal bloom (HAB)
   concern for the region, leading to a strong focus on prediction and
   mitigation of these blooms and their toxic effects. This paper describes
   the initial development of the California Harmful Algae Risk Mapping
   (C-HARM) system that predicts the spatial likelihood of blooms and
   dangerous levels of DA using a unique blend of numerical models,
   ecological forecast models of the target group, Pseudo-nitzschia, and
   satellite ocean color imagery. Data interpolating empirical orthogonal
   functions (DINEOF) are applied to ocean color imagery to fill in missing
   data and then used in a multivariate mode with other modeled variables
   to forecast biogeochemical parameters. Daily predictions (nowcast and
   forecast maps) are run routinely at the Central and Northern California
   Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and posted on its public website. Skill
   assessment of model output for the nowcast data is restricted to
   nearshore pixels that overlap with routine pier monitoring of HABs in
   California from 2014 to 2015. Model lead times are best correlated with
   DA measured with solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATI') and
   marine mammal strandings from DA toxicosis, suggesting long-term
   benefits of the HAB predictions to decision making. Over the next three
   years, the C-HARM application system will be incorporated into the NOAA
   operational HAB forecasting system and HAB Bulletin. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {The ozone hole measurements at the Indian station Maitri in Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Stratospheric ozone is a trace gas of great importance as it filters
   harmful ultraviolet radiations reaching the earth surface. Since ozone
   influences temperature and dynamics of the stratosphere, it is also a
   climate-relevant gas by modifyimg the tropospheric temperature.
   Significant changes in the stratospheric ozone are, therefore, a concern
   for human health and climate. India has a dedicated polar research
   programme with two stations in Antarctica; Maitri (70.4 degrees 5, 11.4
   degrees E, since 1989) and Bharati (69.2 degrees 5, 76.2 degrees E,
   since 2012). Semi-regular measurements of total column ozone (TCO) are
   carried out to monitor the changes in the ozone layer there. Here, we
   use the available TCO measurements from Maitri in the winters of
   1999-2003 and 2006, to estimate the chemical ozone depletion for the
   first time there. We estimate the largest ozone loss (59\% or 180 DU) in
   2006, and smallest in 2002 and 1999 (44\% or 160 DU) among the winters;
   consistent with the meteorology, as the winter 2006 was the coldest and
   2002 was the warmest with the first-ever major sudden stratospheric
   warming over Antarctica. The Maitri ozone loss analysis is found to be
   representative for the whole Antarctica as assessed from the comparisons
   with the average TCO from all Antarctic stations and satellite overpass
   TCO observations. The study, henceforth, demonstrates the value and
   significance of continuous monitoring of the ozone hole at Maitri to
   assist the policy decisions such as the Montreal Protocol and its
   amendments and adjustments.},

Title = {Reclamation-oriented spatiotemporal evolution of coastal wetland along
   Bohai Rim, China},
Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {9},
Pages = {192-204},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are located in the ecotone of interaction between the
   land surface and sea, and anthropogenic activities extensively interfere
   with these wetlands through the reclamation of large tidal wetlands and
   destruction of the function of the ecosystems. In this study, we
   investigated the dynamic evolutionary characteristics of the Bohai Rim
   coastal area over the past 40 years using the Modified Normalized
   Difference Water Index, the fractal dimension, object-oriented
   classification, the land-use transfer trajectory, and regression
   analysis. Additionally, we quantified and monitored the evolution of
   reclamation and analyzed the correlation between reclamation and coastal
   wetlands based on 99 Landsat-2, -5, and -8 images (at 60 m and 30 m
   spatial resolution) over the period 1980-2019. The results are as
   follows. (1) The coastline of the Bohai Rim increased by 1 631.2 km from
   1980 to 2019 with a zigzag variation. The artificial coastline increased
   by 2 946.1 km, whereas the natural coastline decreased by 90\%. (2) The
   area of man-made wetlands increased by 3 736.9 km(2), the area of
   construction land increased by 1 008.4 km(2), and the natural wetland
   area decreased by 66\%. The decrease of tidal flats is the main
   contributor to the decrease of natural wetland area (takes account for
   91.1\%). Coastal areas are affected by intense human disturbance, which
   was taken place across a large area of tidal flats and caused the
   landscape to fragment and be more heterogeneous. The coastal zone
   development activities were primarily concentrated in the southern
   Laizhou Bay, the Yellow River Delta, the Bohai Bay, the northern
   Liaodong Bay, and the Pulandian Bay. The solidified shorelines and
   increase in sea level have resulted in intertidal wetlands decreasing
   and impaired wetland ecology. (3) There is a good agreement between
   reclamation and the size of the coastal wetlands. Both land reclamation
   and the reduction in coastal wetland areas are significantly related to
   the population size, fishery output value, and urbanization rate. In
   summary, human activities, such as the construction of aquaculture ponds
   and salt pans, industrialization, and urbanization, are the primary
   forces that influence the environmental changes in the coastal region.
   This study is beneficial for establishing and improving the systems for
   the rational development and utilization of natural resources, and
   provides theoretical references for restoring wetland ecology and
   managing future reclamation activities in other coastal zone-related
   areas.},

Abstract = {In this study, traffic noise in Seferihisar, which is a holiday resort
   by the Aegean Sea in the West of Turkey, was investigated. The noise
   occurring in summer and winter, on weekdays, and at weekends was mapped
   separately. Besides, land uses exposed to traffic noise were specified.
   In the carried out method, the land uses were primarily mapped by using
   the satellite images of the study area. Then, the noise was measured at
   46 points during ten days in summer and winter, on weekdays and at
   weekends, and it was mapped by using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
   method and by means of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques.
   The measurements were taken in the daytime (07: 00-19: 00), in the
   evening (19: 00-23: 00), and at night (23: 00-07: 00) as stated in the
   Turkish Regulation of Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise.
   Since the time interval of the daytime measurements was large, the noise
   was measured in three different periods for the daytime measurements. In
   the formation of noise maps, logarithmic averages of all measurements
   taken at each point were used. The noise maps were overlapped with the
   land use maps by the help of the GIS techniques; the land use affected
   by the noise was analyzed.
   The results showed that the road traffic noise varied from summer to
   winter seasons in the study area depending on heavy or light traffic.
   The noise occurring in summer showed an increase both on weekdays and at
   weekends. While the limit value was exceeded in 49 of the measurement
   averages taken in winter, the limit value was exceeded in 96
   measurements taken in summer. The noise maps formed according to the IDW
   method displayed that the areas in which the limit value was exceeded in
   the daytime in summer took up 14.27\% of the study area while this rate
   went down to 4.06\% in winter. The study area is one of the most
   important destinations for summer holiday. 20.12\% of the area that
   exceeded the limit value in summer was builtup and 10.69\% of them was
   tourism area. The noise together with population and traffic that
   increase in summer season is an important environmental problem against
   which some precautions should be taken. The findings of the study
   present significant results which might guide local governments in
   preventing and managing the noise.},

Abstract = {To enhance recovery of the Endangered North Atlantic right whale
   Eubalaena glacialis, mitigation strategies are needed to reduce the
   leading causes of injury and mortality of these animals, which include
   ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Such efforts require
   information on the spatial and temporal distribution of right whales
   that can be analyzed against risk factors to identify solutions to
   protect whales while minimizing economic impacts to industry. Currently,
   no methods adequately make use of all available data to characterize
   right whale distribution, often leaving data gaps or misrepresenting
   whale activity in areas where we have limited systematic survey data. In
   response to this, an areal co-kriging interpolation technique was
   developed using ArcGIS 10.1 Geostatistical Analyst, utilizing all
   available right whale location data including systematic survey data,
   opportunistic sightings data, and satellite tag data. With many
   management plans shaped around specific geographic zones, this
   methodology was developed with the option to summarize information
   within user-defined polygons depending on the management regime. For
   this paper, whale distribution predictions were summarized to 524
   irregularly shaped polygons off coastal Maine, representing lobster
   fishing zones at a 2 mo temporal scale. Results indicate that the
   predicted values fall within reasonable ranges, appropriately represent
   seasonal differences, and better represent right whale distribution
   patterns compared to other methods.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes
   self-management education and support (DSMES) among veterans with
   diabetes using the Healthy Teaching Kitchen (HTK) by means of telehealth
   communication.
   Methods
   A retrospective chart review collected data from veterans with type 2
   diabetes (T2DM) that participated in the DSMES-HTK program at 2 Veterans
   Affairs Northeast Ohio Healthcare System facilities between February
   2013 and December 2018. A factorial design was used to compare A1C data
   and use of clinical video telehealth from main hub to satellite site.
   Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 25). Repeated
   measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) were performed to compare mean
   A1C in veterans that attended HTK at the main site versus a telehealth
   site. RMANOVA was also used to compare mean A1C in veterans that
   attended at least 1 hands-on class versus those that attended at least 1
   demonstration class.
   Results
   A1C values of all groups improved over time and were sustained
   regardless of DSMES-HTK delivery method or location.
   Conclusions
   Sustained improvement in A1C was observed in patients that participated
   in both DSMES-HTK in person and via clinical video telehealth classes
   conducted by hub site facilitator with RDN, CDCES credential. The use of
   a clinical video telehealth strategy for DSMES-HTK capitalizes on
   limited, highly skilled, credentialed instructional team members.},

Title = {Wrong-Side Thoracentesis Lessons Learned From Root Cause Analysis},
Journal = {JAMA SURGERY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {149},
Number = {8},
Pages = {774-779},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Despite the recognized value of the Joint Commission's
   Universal Protocol and the implementation of time-outs, incorrect
   surgical procedures are still among the most common types of sentinel
   events and can have fatal consequences.
   OBJECTIVES To examine a root cause analysis database for reported
   wrong-side thoracenteses and to determine the contributing factors
   associated with their occurrence.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched the National Center for
   Patient Safety database for wrong-side thoracenteses performed in
   ambulatory clinics and hospital units other than the operating room
   reported from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Data extracted included patient factors,
   clinical features, team structure and function, adherence to bottom-line
   patient safety measures, complications, and outcomes.
   RESULTS Fourteen cases of wrong-side thoracenteses are identified.
   Contributing factors included failure to perform a time-out (n=12),
   missing indication of laterality on the patient's consent form (n=10),
   absence of a site mark on the patient's skin within the sterile field
   (n=12), and absent verification of medical images (n=7). Complications
   included pneumothoraces (n=4), hemorrhage (n=3), and death directly
   attributable to the wrong-side thoracentesis (n=2). Teamwork and
   communication failure, unawareness of existing policy, and a deficit in
   training and education were the most common root causes of wrong-side
   thoracentesis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Prevention of wrong-site procedures and
   accompanying patient harm outside the operating room requires adherence
   to the Universal Protocol and time-outs, effective teamwork, training
   and education, mentoring, and patient assessment for early detection of
   complications. The time-outs provide protected time and place for error
   detection and recovery.},

Title = {Development and validation of a model to estimate postharvest losses
   during transport of tomatoes in West Africa},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {32-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In an effort to better understand postharvest losses associated with
   low-cost tomato transport in West Africa we present a spatial-temporal
   simulation model that links the prevailing outside weather conditions,
   estimated using satellite meteorology, to the microclimate observed
   inside truck trailers (cryptoclimate) to determine the deterioration in
   tomato quality during transport. Tomatoes from Burkina Faso are
   transported under sub-optimal circumstances to important Ghanaian
   markets; during a number of these transports conditions for the tomato
   cargo inside trucks were measured while conditions outside the trucks
   were monitored by means of weather satellites. The presented tomato
   quality model analytically combines cryptoclimate, duration since
   harvest, and kinetic modelling to arrive at estimated firmness. Firmness
   of tomatoes in transport was monitored with a portable penetrometer in
   selected trucks, augmented with additional (acoustic firmness) data
   collected in a climate chamber. Half of these observations were used to
   calibrate a firmness loss model and the other half to validate the
   simulation results.
   Our results indicate that outside weather during transport can be
   reasonably well estimated using satellite meteorology. The model
   performance for the estimation of outside global radiation (Rg) and
   land-surface temperature (LST) were found to be satisfactory, with a
   RMSE = 87.98 W m(-2); bias = 57.39 W m(-2) and RMSE = 2.95 degrees C;
   bias = 0.91 degrees C, respectively. Results for the cryptoclimate
   estimation (conditions inside the trucks) for temperature, relative
   humidity, and light intensity were as follows: R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 4.18
   degrees C (T-incargo); R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 19.59\% (RHincargo); and R-2 =
   0.9, RMSE = 137.31 lx (LIincargo). The postharvest loss model that
   relies on these estimates as its input explained on average 77\% of the
   variance in observed tomatoes firmness, with total product losses
   ranging from 30\% to 50\% when integrated over the entire transportation
   period.
   With the accuracy of the model quantified and the causality of losses
   partially demonstrated, we argue that the simulation model can be useful
   as an economic resistor in transport optimization studies to investigate
   the cost-benefit of various measures to reduce postharvest losses. Such
   studies could help to illustrate what net gains can be expected if
   delays along the transportation route are reduced, cargo conditions are
   semi-controlled (e.g. pre-cooling treatment), or if a different
   transport schedule is adopted. The model may also be used to show the
   impact of different climate change scenarios on postharvest losses. (C)

Title = {Predicting the Potential Impact of Climate Change on Carbon Stock in
   Semi-Arid West African Savannas},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {West African savannas are experiencing rapid land cover change that
   threatens biodiversity and affects ecosystem productivity through the
   loss of habitat and biomass, and carbon emissions into the atmosphere
   exacerbating climate change effects. Therefore, reducing carbon
   emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in these areas is
   critical in the efforts to combat climate change. For such restorative
   actions to be successful, they must be grounded on a clear knowledge of
   the extent to which climate change affects carbon storage in soil and
   biomass according to different land uses. The current study was
   undertaken in semi-arid savannas in Dano, southwestern Burkina Faso,
   with the threefold objective of: (i) identifying the main land use and
   land cover categories (LULCc) in a watershed; (ii) assessing the carbon
   stocks (biomass and soil) in the selected LULCc; and (iii) predicting
   the effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of the carbon
   stock. Dendrometric data (Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and height) of
   woody species and soil samples were measured and collected,
   respectively, in 43 plots, each measuring 50 x 20 m. Tree biomass carbon
   stocks were calculated using allometric equations while soil organic
   carbon (SOC) stocks were measured at two depths (0-20 and 20-50 cm). To
   assess the impact of climate change on carbon stocks, geographical
   location records of carbon stocks, remote sensing spectral bands,
   topographic data, and bioclimatic variables were used. For projections
   of future climatic conditions, predictions from two climate models
   (MPI-ESM-MR and HadGEM2-ES) of CMIP5 were used under Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and modeling was performed using random
   forest regression. Results showed that the most dominant LULCc are
   cropland (37.2\%) and tree savannas (35.51\%). Carbon stocks in woody
   biomass were higher in woodland (10.2 +/- 6.4 Mg.ha(-1)) and gallery
   forests (7.75 +/- 4.05 Mg.ha(-1)), while the lowest values were recorded
   in shrub savannas (0.9 +/- 1.2 Mg.ha(-1)) and tree savannas (1.6 0.6 +/-
   Mg.ha(-1)). The highest SOC stock was recorded in gallery forests (30.2
   +/- 15.6 Mg.ha(-1)) and the lowest in the cropland (14.9 +/- 5.7
   Mg.ha(-1)). Based on modeling results, it appears clearly that climate
   change might have an impact on carbon stock at horizon 2070 by
   decreasing the storage capacity of various land units which are
   currently suitable. The decrease was more important under HadGEM2-ES
   (90.0\%) and less under MPI-ESM-MR (89.4\%). These findings call for
   smart and sustainable land use management practices in the study area to
   unlock the potential of these landscapes to sequestering carbon.},

Abstract = {Land use and land cover changes (LULCC) within a highly anthropized
   Mediterranean landscape dominated by industrial tree plantation leads to
   degradation of soil physical properties. This process has been more
   intense in the coastal range of south-central Chile due to its soils,
   which are highly susceptible to erosion, combined with a long history of
   intensive land use changes during the last century, transitioning from
   native forest (NF) to agriculture and the more recent establishment of
   Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. exotic tree plantations. In this
   context, the aim of this study was to assess the statuses of soil
   physical properties over different land cover situations. Historical
   land cover maps were determined via supervised classifications using the
   maximum likelihood classifier applied to satellite imagery. Five land
   use and land cover categories (LULC) were defined according to main land
   cover transitions associated with active and abandoned forestry
   operations that have been reported in the region: Ni, pine plantation
   (P), eucalyptus plantation (Eu), early successional (E-S), and secondary
   successional (S-S). Successional stages were generated using change
   detection statistics considering changes between 2001 and 2014 maps.
   Soil samples were collected at three depths in 39 plots that describe
   the five LULC. High clay contents were found in all the LULC except Eu
   and P. These sites have shown more signs of degradation, with lower
   organic matter (SOM) and macropores and higher shear strength (ShS).
   Soil organic matter was consistent with litter contribution and quality,
   establishing lower bulk density (Db) for NF and S-S and higher values
   for Eu and E-S. ShS and dispersion rate (DR) exhibit a correlation with
   SOM with lower ShS and higher DR when SOM increased. Relevant
   differences were identified for structural stability index (SSI) between
   LULC depending on soil physical quality, besides a positive correlation
   with SOM. Those results show the need to generate appropriate conditions
   of vegetation cover in order to recover soils subjected to current
   forestry management of industrial plantations.},

Title = {Analysis of Urban Morphological Effect on the Microclimate of the Urban

Abstract = {As a Malay Agricultural Settlement established in 1900, Kampung Baru
   which is located in Kuala Lumpur, has become a subject of prolonged
   national interests in terms of economic, social, environment, and
   political issues along with the pressure of modern and future
   development. This study investigated the urban morphological impact of
   Kampung Baru on the intensity of urban heat island (UHI) by developing a
   smart geodatabase for urban climatic mapping. The database provided
   baseline data which was crucial to unveil the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of UHI in Kampung Baru. Determination of the urban heat
   island intensity (UHII) in Kampung Baru was carried out through two
   approaches, mobile and fixed measurements. In a period of six days, the
   mobile measurement was conducted within the target area at night using a
   motorcycle equipped with the temperature and relative humidity data
   logger while the fixed measurement was conducted using the similar
   equipment installed at a school building in the area. Building height
   data were also collected while building footprints were digitized using
   a topographical map and the satellite image was used as the base map. To
   estimate the UHII, the reference data for rural temperature was obtained
   from the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD). All of the data were
   analyzed using ArcGIS to portray the temperature pattern in the study
   area. The analysis revealed the presence of UHI effect in Kampung Baru
   at the average building height of six to ten metres. The results of the
   fixed measurement showed an island-like local maximum in the study area
   with the average and maximum UHII values of 4.4 degrees C and 6.0
   degrees C, respectively. The results from the mobile measurement also
   showed that the highest temperature was recorded in Kampung Baru rather
   than in the surrounding areas of different land-use types throughout the
   observation days. The spatial temperature distribution in the study area
   also showed that the most affected part was the south-west of Kampung
   Baru which is surrounded by tall buildings. The findings of this study
   could be utilized in the planning of new development in the city of
   Kuala Lumpur.},

Abstract = {Seabuckthorn (Hippophae sp.), belonging to Elaeagnaceae, is a thorny,
   dioecious bush growing wild in the cold and dry regions of Indian
   Himalayas mainly in Ladakh (J\&K), Lahaul- Spiti and Kinnaur (HP),
   Kumaon-Garhwal (Uttranchal) and Sikkim/Arunachal Pradesh in the
   North-East region. The ripe fruits of seabuckthorn are a rich source of
   vitamins (A, B, C, and K\&E) with antioxidant and anti stress
   properties. The plant has medicinal and fodder value besides food and
   cosmetics properties. However, no attention has been given towards the
   scientific conservation, propagation and utilization of this valuable
   plant. Keeping the above in view, Field Research Laboratory (DRDO),
   located at an altitude of 11500 ft above the MSL, undertook several
   research and development projects on seabuckthorn from 1992 to promote
   cultivation and utilization of seabuckthorn for human welfare.
   Satellite imaginary conducted to estimate the naturally growing areas of
   seabuckthorn had revealed 11,500 ha pure area of seabuckthorn in the
   Ladakh region. However, the total area of seabuckthorn vegetation is
   around 30,000 ha in Ladakh. Extensive explorations have been conducted
   to identify the promising genetic diversity in the crop in the region
   which has considerable variation in the physicochemical properties of
   the fruits. Three promising selections have been made from the natural
   population and Field genmaile banks have been established to conserve
   this natural diversity. In order to popularize scientific cultivation of
   this valuable plant, propagation through seeds, stem cuttings (using
   PBRs) and suckers, has been standardized. Efforts are also in progress
   to develop the protocols for in vitro propagation of seabuckthorn. Model
   seabuckthorn orchards have been established using different planting
   systems/distances and by maintaining proper male: female plant ratio.
   The laboratory has developed and patented the process for preparation of
   nutritive beverage from seabuckthorn fruits which has been
   commercialized by private vendors and products are readily available in
   Indian market. The process for preparation of other food products such
   as jam, pickle, puree, blended/spiced beverages, wine etc have also been
   developed and are in the process of being patented and commercialized.
   The need of the hour is to standardize canopy/orchard management
   practices, post harvest management/value addition techniques, scientific
   method of harvesting and adopting modern breeding approaches for crop
   improvement of seabuckthorn to harness its food and medicinal properties
   for human welfare.},

Title = {Special treatment issues in lung. cancer - ACCP evidence-based clinical
   practice guidelines (2nd edition)},
Journal = {CHEST},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {132},
Number = {3, S},
Pages = {290S-305S},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: This chapter of the guidelines addresses patients who have
   particular forms of non-small cell lung cancer that require special
   considerations. This includes patients with Pancoast tumors, T4N0,1M0
   tumors, satellite nodules in the same lobe, synchronous and metachronous
   multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs), solitary brain and adrenal
   metastases, and chest wall involvement.
   Methods: The nature of these special clinical cases is such that in most
   cases, metaanalyses or large prospective studies of patients are not
   available. For ensuring that these guidelines were supported by the most
   current data available, publications that were appropriate to the topics
   covered in this chapter were obtained by performance of a literature
   search of the MEDLINE computerized database. When possible, we also
   referenced other consensus opinion statements. Recommendations were
   developed by the writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see
   ``Methodology for Lung Cancer Evidence Review and Guideline
   Development{''} chapter), and reviewed by all members of the lung cancer
   panel before approval by the Thoracic Oncology NetWork, Health and
   Science Policy Committee, and the Board of Regents of the American
   College of Chest Physicians.
   Results: In patients with a Pancoast tumor, a multimodality approach
   seems to be optimal, involving chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection,
   provided appropriate staging has been conducted. Patients with central
   T4 tumors that do not have mediastinal node involvement are uncommon.
   Such patients, however, seem to benefit from resection as part of the
   treatment as opposed to chemoradiotherapy alone when carefully staged
   and selected. Patients with a satellite lesion in the same lobe as the
   primary tumor have a good prognosis and require no modification of the
   approach to evaluation and treatment than what would be dictated by the
   primary tumor alone. However, it is difficult to know how best to treat
   patients with a focus of the same type of cancer in a different lobe.
   Although MPLCs do occur, the survival results after resection for either
   a synchronous presentation or a metachronous presentation with an
   interval of < 4 years between tumors are variable and generally poor,
   suggesting that many of these patients may have had a pulmonary
   metastasis rather than a second primary lung cancer. A thorough and
   careful evaluation of these patients is warranted to try to
   differentiate between patients with a metastasis and a second primary
   lung cancer, although criteria to distinguish them have not been
   defined. Selected patients with a solitary focus of metastatic disease
   in the brain or adrenal gland seem to benefit substantially from
   resection. This is particularly true in patients with a long
   disease-free interval. Finally, in patients with chest wall involvement,
   as long as tumors can be completely resected and there is absence of N2
   nodal involvement, primary surgical treatment should be considered.
   Conclusions: Carefully selected patients may benefit from an aggressive
   surgical approach.},

Title = {Assessment of the performance of drought indices for explaining crop
   yield variability at the national scale: Methodological framework and
   application to Mozambique},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {246},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Droughts are one of the most damaging and complex natural disasters in
   the world, and they frequently affect agricultural production. Drought
   monitoring is essential for decision-makers seeking to minimize the
   socio-economic impacts related to drought events. In this study, we
   propose a methodology to identify the most suitable drought indices and
   data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops. Mozambique
   is used as a case study, as it represents a challenging example because
   of its poor hydroclimatic monitoring network and a lack of disaggregated
   data for agricultural production. A total of seven standardized drought
   indicators (SPI, SPEI, SSI, SVCI, STCI, SVHI, and STWS) at different
   scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) were obtained from global databases and
   evaluated as possible predictors of the annual variability of
   agricultural yields at the national level. A statistical model of crop
   yields based on time series was used to measure the explanatory capacity
   of each index. SPEI and SSI were the most effective at detecting the
   country's historical drought records regardless of whether nationally
   averaged values or the percentages of area affected by drought (PAA)
   were used. However, PAA was found to be a more accurate predictor of
   variability in crop yields. The variability of most cereals (maize,
   millet and sorghum) was adequately explained by the PAA of SPEI-3, with
   that of other crops (cashew nuts, cassava, potatoes, tea, tobacco and
   vegetables) being explained by the PAA of SSI-12. Specific indicators
   were proposed for monitoring wheat and sugar cane. These results can
   directly support managers and decision makers in developing drought
   contingency plans in Mozambique. To further demonstrate the potential of
   this methodology, it should be tested in other regions with a greater
   availability of agricultural data, including spatial disaggregation.},

   and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment,
   but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars
   and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry
   in C\&R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and
   challenges. There are now about 250 C\&R studies but only one quarter of
   these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C\&R studies that
   have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We
   found that the majority of C\&R telemetry studies used either radio or
   acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite
   technologies. Most C\&R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess
   mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of
   displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies (< 8\%) have used
   physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly
   applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C\&R
   and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as
   death. We conclude that C\&R science has the potential to benefit
   greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to
   providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and
   adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding
   the lethal and sublethal impacts of C\&R. However, there are still a
   number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and
   methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and
   handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in
   assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C\&R
   biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby
   offer C\&R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries
   management and conservation.},

Title = {Improved Classification Models to Distinguish Natural from Anthropic Oil
   Slicks in the Gulf of Mexico: Seasonality and Radarsat-2 Beam Mode
   Effects under a Machine Learning Approach},

Abstract = {Distinguishing between natural and anthropic oil slicks is a challenging
   task, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where these events can be
   simultaneously observed and recognized as seeps or spills. In this
   study, a powerful data analysis provided by machine learning (ML)
   methods was employed to develop, test, and implement a classification
   model (CM) to distinguish an oil slick source (OSS) as natural or
   anthropic. A robust database containing 4916 validated oil samples,
   detected using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was employed for this
   task. Six ML algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural
   networks (ANN), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes
   (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR).
   Using RF, the global CM achieved a maximum accuracy value of 73.15. An
   innovative approach evaluated how external factors, such as seasonality,
   satellite configurations, and the synergy between them, limit or improve
   OSS predictions. To accomplish this, specific classification models
   (SCMs) were derived from the global ones (CMs), tuning the best
   algorithms and parameters according to different scenarios. Median
   accuracies revealed winter and spring to be the best seasons and ScanSAR
   Narrow B (SCNB) as the best beam mode. The maximum median accuracy to
   distinguish seeps from spills was achieved in winter using SCNB (83.05).
   Among the tested algorithms, RF was the most robust, with a better
   performance in 81\% of the investigated scenarios. The accuracy
   increment provided by the well-fitted models may minimize the confusion
   between seeps and spills. This represents a concrete contribution to
   reducing economic and geologic risks derived from exploration activities
   in offshore areas. Additionally, from an operational standpoint,
   specific models support specialists to select the best SAR products and
   seasons for new acquisitions, as well as to optimize performances
   according to the available data.},

Title = {A pilot project combining multispectral proximal sensors and digital
   cameras for monitoring tropical pastures},

Pages = {4673-4695},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate monitoring of pasture biomass and ground cover is
   necessary in livestock production systems to ensure productive and
   sustainable management. Interest in the use of proximal sensors for
   monitoring pasture status in grazing systems has increased, since data
   can be returned in near real time. Proximal sensors have the potential
   for deployment on large properties where remote sensing may not be
   suitable due to issues such as spatial scale or cloud cover. There are
   unresolved challenges in gathering reliable sensor data and in
   calibrating raw sensor data to values such as pasture biomass or
   vegetation ground cover, which allow meaningful interpretation of sensor
   data by livestock producers.
   Our goal was to assess whether a combination of proximal sensors could
   be reliably deployed to monitor tropical pasture status in an
   operational beef production system, as a precursor to designing a full
   sensor deployment. We use this pilot project to (1) illustrate practical
   issues around sensor deployment, (2) develop the methods necessary for
   the quality control of the sensor data, and (3) assess the strength of
   the relationships between vegetation indices derived from the proximal
   sensors and field observations across the wet and dry seasons.
   Proximal sensors were deployed at two sites in a tropical pasture on a
   beef production property near Townsville, Australia. Each site was
   monitored by a Skye SKR-four-band multispectral sensor (every 1 min), a
   digital camera (every 30 min), and a soil moisture sensor (every 1 min),
   each of which were operated over 18 months. Raw data from each sensor
   was processed to calculate multispectral vegetation indices. The data
   capture from the digital cameras was more reliable than the
   multispectral sensors, which had up to 67\% of data discarded after data
   cleaning and quality control for technical issues related to the sensor
   design, as well as environmental issues such as water incursion and
   insect infestations. We recommend having a system with both sensor types
   to aid in data interpretation and troubleshooting technical issues.
   Non-destructive observations of pasture characteristics, including
   above-ground standing biomass and fractional ground cover, were made
   every 2 weeks. This simplified data collection was designed for multiple
   years of sampling at the remote site, but had the disadvantage of high
   measurement uncertainty.
   A bootstrapping method was used to explore the strength of the
   relationships between sensor and pasture observations. Due to the
   uncertainty in the field observations, the relationships between sensor
   and field data are not confirmational and should be used only to inform
   the design of future work. We found the strongest relationships occurred
   during the wet season period of maximum pasture growth (January to
   April), with generally poor relationships outside of this period. Strong
   relationships were found with multispectral indices that were sensitive
   to the green and dry components of the vegetation, such as those
   containing the band in the lower shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the
   electromagnetic spectrum. During the wet season the bias-adjusted
   bootstrap point estimate of the R-2 between above-ground biomass and the
   normalized ratio between the SWIR and red bands (NVI-SR) was 0.72 (95\%
   CI of 0.28 to 0.98), while that for the percentage of green vegetation
   observed in three dimensions and a simple ratio between the near
   infrared and SWIR bands (RatioNS34) was 0.81 (95\% CI of 0.53 to 1.00).
   Relationships between field data and the vegetation index derived from
   the digital camera images were generally weaker than from the
   multispectral sensor data, except for green vegetation observations in
   two and three dimensions.
   Our successful pilot of multiple proximal sensors supports the design of
   future deployments in tropical pastures and their potential for
   operational use. The stringent rules we developed for data cleaning can
   be more broadly applied to other sensor projects to ensure quality data.
   Although proximal sensors observe only a small area of the pasture, they
   deliver continual and timely pasture measurements to inform timely
   on-farm decision-making.},

Title = {Treatment Persistence in Patients Cycling on Subcutaneous Tumor Necrosis
   Factor-Alpha Inhibitors in Inflammatory Arthritis: A Retrospective Study},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN THERAPY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {244-255},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Biologic treatments including subcutaneous tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha inhibitors (SC-TNFis) have greatly improved disease
   management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and
   spondyloarthritis (SpA) (collectively inflammatory arthritis, IA).
   Nevertheless, some patients discontinue their first-line treatment; for
   them, one option may be a subsequent line of the same treatment class
   (i.e., cycling). The aim of this study was to assess treatment
   persistence between first- and second-line therapy in Swedish IA
   patients cycling on SC-TNFis.
   Methods: Using data from the Swedish Health Data Registers, adult IA
   patients filling prescriptions between May 1, 2010, and October 31,
   2016, for a SC-TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and golimumab)
   were included. Treatment persistence was derived based on information
   from filled prescriptions and a 60-day grace period. Unadjusted and
   adjusted marginal Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to
   estimate the relative risk of discontinuation across treatment lines,
   using robust sandwich covariance matrix estimates to account for
   intrapatient dependence (i.e., multiple treatment lines per patient).
   The analysis was restricted to the first two lines of treatment.
   Results: Of the eligible patients, 3181 were identified as cyclers.
   Among these, most were female (68\%), and 48\%, 28\% and 24\% were
   diagnosed with RA, AS and PsA, respectively. Both the unadjusted and
   adjusted analyses showed that the relative risk of discontinuing SC-TNFi
   treatment was significantly lower in second compared to first line
   (hazard ratio: 0.56 {[}0.53, 0.59] and 0.59 {[}0.56, 0.62],
   respectively). This finding was also consistent across IA indications.
   Conclusions: In this study of patients cycling on SC-TNFis in IA,
   persistence was greater in second-compared to first-line treatment. The
   finding was consistent across all IA indications. Hence, patients who
   discontinue their first-line treatment may still benefit from treatment
   with an alternative SC-TNFi as a second-line therapy in IA.},

Title = {Health-related quality of life in breast cancer patients: A
   bibliographic review of the literature from 1974 to 2007},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {27},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Background: Quality of life in patients with breast cancer is an
   important outcome. This paper presents an extensive overview on the
   topic ranging from descriptive findings to clinical trials.
   Methods: This was a bibliographic review of the literature covering all
   full publications that appeared in English language biomedical journals
   between 1974 and 2007. The search strategy included a combination of key
   words `quality of life' and `breast cancer' or `breast carcinoma' in
   titles. A total of 971 citations were identified and after exclusion of
   duplicates, the abstracts of 606 citations were reviewed. Of these,
   meetings abstracts, editorials, brief commentaries, letters, errata and
   dissertation abstracts and papers that appeared online and were indexed
   ahead of publication were also excluded. The remaining 477 papers were
   examined. The major findings are summarized and presented under several
   headings: instruments used, validation studies, measurement issues,
   surgical treatment, systemic therapies, quality of life as predictor of
   survival, psychological distress, supportive care, symptoms and sexual
   functioning.
   Results: Instruments-Several valid instruments were used to measure
   quality of life in breast cancer patients. The European Organization for
   Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Cancer Quality of Life
   Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its breast cancer specific
   complementary measure (EORTC QLQ-BR23) and the Functional Assessment
   Chronic Illness Therapy General questionnaire (FACIT-G) and its breast
   cancer module (FACIT-B) were found to be the most common and well
   developed instruments to measure quality of life in breast cancer
   patients. Surgery-different surgical procedures led to relatively
   similar results in terms of quality of life assessments, although
   mastectomy patients compared to conserving surgery patients usually
   reported a lower body image and sexual functioning. Systemic
   therapies-almost all studies indicated that breast cancer patients
   receiving chemotherapy might experience several side-effects and
   symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. Adjuvant hormonal
   therapies also were found to have similar negative impact on quality of
   life, although in general they were associated with improved survival.
   Quality of life as predictor of survival-similar to known medical
   factors, quality of life data in metastatic breast cancer patients was
   found to be prognostic and predictive of survival time. Psychological
   distress-anxiety and depression were found to be common among breast
   cancer patients even years after the disease diagnosis and treatment.
   Psychological factors also were found to predict subsequent quality of
   life or even overall survival in breast cancer patients. Supportive
   care-clinical treatments to control emesis, or interventions such as
   counseling, providing social support and exercise could improve quality
   of life. Symptoms-Pain, fatigue, arm morbidity and postmenopausal
   symptoms were among the most common symptoms reported by breast cancer
   patients. As recommended, recognition and management of these symptoms
   is an important issue since such symptoms impair health-related quality
   of life. Sexual functioning-breast cancer patients especially younger
   patients suffer from poor sexual functioning that negatively affect
   quality of life.
   Conclusion: There was quite an extensive body of the literature on
   quality of life in breast cancer patients. These papers have made a
   considerable contribution to improving breast cancer care, although
   their exact benefit was hard to define. However, quality of life data
   provided scientific evidence for clinical decision-making and conveyed
   helpful information concerning breast cancer patients' experiences
   during the course of the disease diagnosis, treatment, disease-free
   survival time, and recurrences; otherwise finding patient-centered
   solutions for evidence-based selection of optimal treatments,
   psychosocial interventions, patient-physician communications, allocation
   of resources, and indicating research priorities were impossible. It
   seems that more qualitative research is needed for a better
   understanding of the topic. In addition, issues related to the disease,
   its treatment side effects and symptoms, and sexual functioning should
   receive more attention when studying quality of life in breast cancer
   patients.},

Abstract = {The current work is aimed to realizing land suitability and water use
   efficiency and determining the optimum land use system. The main aims
   were to identify the physiographic futures and calculate the crop water
   requirements for specific crops. The study area was observed through a
   soil survey inventory in Paris Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt. Ten soil
   profiles plus a number of auger observations and mini pits were selected
   to represent the different mapping units. A fieldwork and morphological
   description were carried out, and soil samples were collected for
   demonstrating the physical and chemical soil properties. Based on
   satellite data that can integrate with GIS utility, field work, and
   laboratory analysis, the physiographic map was generated. The study
   found that the main land type units are plateaus, hills, dunes, and
   depression floor. Concerning the second aim, the main land qualities of
   different mapping units were rated and matched to obtain the current and
   potential land suitability using automated land evaluation system. This
   research concluded that the best crops adapted with the soil conditions
   and could be feasible for economic use are clover, wheat, beans, sugar
   beet, onions, maize, sunflower, tomato, potato, groundnut, pea, lentil,
   barley, sesame, and carrots. Crop water requirements were determined in
   variable rate according to the actual plant requirements using the aid
   of FAO-Cropwat model. Irrigation schedule and consumptive use of
   suitable crops were calculated and adopted. The crop water requirements
   for each selected crop were determined as follow: 828.0, 596.7, 410.3,
   679.95, 409.52, 791.60, 712.2, 902.93, 456.55, 529.95, 231.4, 217.95,
   303.93, 502.65, and 274.35 mm, respectively.},

Abstract = {The most significant innovations in the field of higher education that
   need to be comprehended by the scientific community include the
   transition of a number of Russian universities to personalized learning
   along individual educational trajectories, which radically changes
   agents' everyday practices within the educational space. Based on an
   empirical study conducted at the University of Tyumen in December 2022
   (N = 1000), the educational strategies of first-year students in the
   context of individual educational trajectories have been considered in
   the article. Regarding studying at a university as a stage of the
   educational trajectory, which is part of the entire life path of a
   student, we use the temporal and value properties of the student's life
   world, their dynamics in the process of moving along an individual
   educational trajectory within the institutional space of the university
   as the basis for the typology of educational strategies. Factor analysis
   included the following components: 1) the meaning of past events ({''}
   Factors of the experience of studying at school{''}); 2) the value of
   relevant learning practices ({''} Factors of readiness for studying at a
   university (competence factors){''} and `` Factors of the principles
   importance of training within the individual educational
   trajectory{''}); 3) anticipation of the future - plans, goals, possible
   personal trajectories of life ({''}Factors of expectations from studying
   at a university{''} and `` Professional prospects factors{''}). These
   groups of factors have been considered as independent empirical
   indicators and used as classification features for the subsequent
   differentiation of respondents into clusters. The result of the factor
   and cluster analysis is the typology of educational strategies of
   first-year students in the context of the implementation of the new
   educational model: ``conformists{''}, ``excellent students{''},
   ``activists{''}, ``nihilists{''}; each of them has its own educational
   strategy at the university. Conclusions are drawn about the expediency
   of building such a typology at the beginning of the student's
   educational trajectory, as this allows making timely management
   decisions on the development of educational strategies desirable for the
   university and the labor market and the correction of tundesirable ones,
   as well as the possibility of further monitoring measurements.},

Title = {Quantitative catchment profiling to apportion faecal indicator organism
   budgets for the Ribble system, the UK's sentinel drainage basin for
   Water Framework Directive research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {87},

Pages = {535-550},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20/60/EC and the US Federal
   Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within
   river drainage basins has shifted from traditional point-source control
   to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and
   diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there
   is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant
   fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive
   (BWD), under the list of `protected areas' in the WFD places a
   requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within
   catchments in order to achieve the objectives of both the BWD (and its
   revision - 2006/7/EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to
   quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance
   parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble
   drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and
   discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of
   high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal
   indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported
   herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest
   wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows
   (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44-day period during the 2002
   bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting
   rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as
   either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean
   faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant
   elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal
   coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90\% of the total organism
   load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources
   during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to
   the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over
   half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the
   River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs
   that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this
   catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV
   disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources
   would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However,
   during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the
   operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater retention tanks. The
   study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure
   and WwTW stormwater retention tanks as the dominant component of the
   high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde
   coast and the associated bathing waters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Planning for the next influenza H1N1 season: a modelling study},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Background: The level of herd immunity before and after the first 2009
   pandemic season is not precisely known, and predicting the shape of the
   next pandemic H1N1 season is a difficult challenge.
   Methods: This was a modelling study based on data on medical visits for
   influenza-like illness collected by the French General Practitioner
   Sentinel network, as well as pandemic H1N1 vaccination coverage rates,
   and an individual-centred model devoted to influenza. We estimated
   infection attack rates during the first 2009 pandemic H1N1 season in
   France, and the rates of pre- and post-exposure immunity. We then
   simulated various scenarios in which a pandemic influenza H1N1 virus
   would be reintroduced into a population with varying levels of
   protective cross-immunity, and considered the impact of extending
   influenza vaccination.
   Results: During the first pandemic season in France, the proportion of
   infected persons was 18.1\% overall, 38.3\% among children, 14.8\% among
   younger adults and 1.6\% among the elderly. The rates of pre-exposure
   immunity required to fit data collected during the first pandemic season
   were 36\% in younger adults and 85\% in the elderly. We estimated that
   the rate of post-exposure immunity was 57.3\% (95\% Confidence Interval
   (95\% CI) 49.6\%-65.0\%) overall, 44.6\% (95\% CI 35.5\%-53.6\%) in
   children, 53.8\% (95\% CI 44.5\%-63.1\%) in younger adults, and 87.4\%
   (95\% CI 82.0\%-92.8\%) in the elderly. The shape of a second season
   would depend on the degree of persistent protective cross-immunity to
   descendants of the 2009 H1N1 viruses. A cross-protection rate of 70\%
   would imply that only a small proportion of the population would be
   affected. With a cross-protection rate of 50\%, the second season would
   have a disease burden similar to the first, while vaccination of 50\% of
   the entire population, in addition to the population vaccinated during
   the first pandemic season, would halve this burden. With a
   cross-protection rate of 30\%, the second season could be more
   substantial, and vaccination would not provide a significant benefit.
   Conclusions: These model-based findings should help to prepare for a
   second pandemic season, and highlight the need for studies of the
   different components of immune protection.},

Title = {Factor analysis for aerosol optical depth and its prediction from the
   perspective of land-use change},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {458-469},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents the non-stationarity and autocorrelation (with a
   Moran's I index score of 0.75) of the MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical
   depth (AOD) of the Wuhan agglomeration (WHA) in Central China, using
   geographically weighted regression (GWR) to identify the spatial
   relationships between AOD and its impact factors. In addition to the
   socio-economic factors, i.e., GDP and population, vegetation cover,
   elevation, land-use density and landscape metrics are also considered.
   Faced with the rapid process of urbanization and the impact of land use
   change on AOD, which has been confirmed in previous studies, we propose
   an AOD prediction method, combining a land-use change simulation model,
   a cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model, and spatial
   relationships built by GWR to represent the spatial distribution of AOD
   in 2030. The results suggest that the GWR model is able to address the
   spatially varying relationships, with an R-squared value, corrected
   Akaike's information criterion (AICc), and standard residual better than
   those of the ordinary least squares (OLS) model. Land-use simulation,
   with an accuracy of 89.76\%, indicates that an increase in the built-up
   area and a decrease in the forest area will be the major trends of
   land-use change and will lead to increased AOD. The AOD simulation
   results indicate that the most developed areas, i.e., the cities of
   Wuhan and Huangshi, will be the AOD increase hot spots in the WHA. This
   study provides an alternative method to identify the varying spatial
   relationships between AOD and its impact factors. A spatial prediction
   method for AOD is developed from the perspective of land-use change,
   which will help land-use planners in decision making.},

Abstract = {Throughout the VEGETATION programme, the Flemish Institute for
   Technological Research (VITO) uninterruptedly hosted the prime user
   segment of both VEGETATION 1 and VEGETATION 2 multispectral instruments
   on board the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre 4 (SPOT 4) and
   SPOT 5 satellites. Operational since the launch of SPOT 4 in March 1998,
   and foreseen to continue at least until the end of the SPOT 5 mission
   (anticipated in spring 2014), this user segment comprises a processing
   facility (PF), actively receiving, processing, correcting, archiving,
   and distributing the VEGETATION data and derived added-value products.
   First and foremost, the VEGETATION programme has been serving the needs
   of operational users - both institutional and commercial - requesting
   data in near-real time. However, scientific and educational users too
   benefited significantly, in particular from VEGETATION's unique time
   series of the Earth's land cover, and more specifically the vegetation
   cover. Over the years, the centralized archive houses processed data
   covering the equivalent of 11,000 times the Earth's surface, and
   delivered more than 50 terapixels to around 10.000 users. As such,
   VEGETATION's mission is a prime example of what Europe wants to achieve
   through the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES)
   initiative: truly operational services providing reliable and up-to-date
   information.This article describes the processing facility, the way the
   data and products are archived, the different dissemination channels as
   well as the data policy adopted and the users served. One of the recent
   evolutions, the development of an entirely new product distribution
   facility (PDF), implemented as part of the Project for On-Board Autonomy
   - Vegetation (PROBA-V) user segment is discussed.},

Abstract = {The effective management of the water related
   resources-environment-disasters system (or as traditionally and
   professionally so called as hydrological system) is one of the vital
   subjects for social and economic development and people's living and
   wealth. It's an essential solution for water related issues to
   comprehensively manage the system on the base of natural drainage basin
   by starting from the rainfall-runoff simulating, routing and
   forecasting, and exploring the physical mechanism and system control
   measurements. Watershed-based rainfall-runoff model and routing model
   are always the research highlights in the field of hydrology as well as
   environmental sciences and calamity. With the development of
   geographical information system (GIS), remote sensing, the theory of
   computing analysis and GPS-meteorology, more powerful tools can be used
   to perform watershed spatial data obtaining, storing, processing and
   analysis and distributed hydrological model has been attracting more and
   more attention from both engineering and academic communities. In the
   meantime, Cellular Automata as an inherent distributed computer might be
   integrated with distributed hydrological model, which may create a new
   way to improve watershed hydrological model development.
   Based on the analysis of the general disciplinarian and the
   particularity for the application of Cellular Automata in geography and
   hydrology respectively, according to the basic principle of hydrological
   model and Cellular Automata, a watershed routing model based on GIS and
   Cellular Automata, HydroCA is proposed in this paper. The local updating
   rule is the core of HydroCA, and is also the key in the process of
   uniting cellular automata with distributed hydrology models. The local
   rules are close interrelated to the model precision. The key of
   establishment of local rules in HydroCA is to determine flow direction
   and flux arrangement among the site and sites in the neighborhood. And
   the rules should be applied in whole the lattice space. Flow direction
   of the site determines flow lines and flow distribution among its Moore
   neighborhood. For the moment, usual methods to determine flow direction,
   are single steepest descent flow direction method, multiple flow
   direction algorithm, resultant vector methods and etc. Inputs of the
   model is divided into two classes, one includes core variables of
   lattice site, the other consists of assistant variables including DEM,
   topographic index(TOPMODEL), water supply ratio, M and etc. Core
   variables are computed using runoff production model. As for assistant
   variables, DEM is provided by geographic information system software and
   the other variables are calculated by special modules. Local rules are
   based on multiple flow direction algorithm, and Runoff flow course is
   the Output.
   A simulation software platform, Hydro CA, by combining the HydroCA model
   for runoff routing with TOPMODEL / SCS model for rainfall-runoff
   simulation operated on the watershed DEM with 100x100m grid size was
   developed and used to simulate runoff process from 1 April 1998 to 31
   August 1998 in the study area LeAnhe Watershed in the northeast of
   JiangXi Province, China. The results of the simulation prove that the
   precision of TOPMODEL simulation can be improved by using HydroCA
   routing model from 64.7\% to 71.0\%, while the precision of combining
   SCS simulation with HydroCA routing is slightly worse than that of
   combining SCS simulation with Unit Hydrograph routing (from 54.7\% to
   57.5\%).
   It is shown that HydroCA model is feasible to simulate the watershed
   runoff routing. Cellular Automata model will contribute to the
   distributed watershed hydrological model research and development by
   providing a new method in calculating runoff forming and converging. It
   can simulate routing process depending on a mechanism from bottom to top
   or from local to global in the research area compositing the movement of
   water of the land-slope and channel. The runoff routing model on the
   basis of cellular automata is calculated in distributed way considering
   heterogeneity in both space and time. Therefore, a task left for us is
   to build a reliable distributed runoff generation model, which can
   provide the values of water condition variables as the temporal values
   for all cells in the lattice space during time intervals.},

Title = {Modernity, space-based patriarchy and global capitalism: implications
   for Syrian women accountants},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the current literature on gender, modernity,
   patriarchy and accounting by bringing insights into the experiences of
   women accountants in Syria: an Arab and predominantly Muslim country. By
   doing so, this paper enhances understanding of women's interrelationship
   with accounting beyond the Anglo-American context that currently
   dominates the research agenda on gender and accounting. Face-to-face
   interviews with 20 women accountants were carried out in Syria in 2008.
   This study reveals that in the context of global capitalism and
   patriarchy, factors of class, alienation, tradition and economic
   difficulties are contributing to the subordinated role of women in
   society in general and in the accounting profession in particular. The
   increased commercialisation of the accounting profession in the Arab
   world, including Syria, has resulted in socio-economic hierarchies and
   discriminatory practices, where interviewees spoke of discrimination
   based on class, sex and on the knowledge held. Further, despite advances
   to Syrian women's access to the public space, the public space for
   Syrian women accountants often operates based largely on how men act in
   this space. Men (and socially/financially advantaged women) often occupy
   aspects of the public (accounting) space that are perceived to be more
   significant and better financially rewarded. Thus, the dichotomy of
   public/private spaces in this study is understood in a broader sense to
   incorporate the symbolic as well as spatial aspects. This paper
   concludes that the accounting profession's aspirations need to be
   challenged through critically evaluating and redefining work roles and
   values to ensure emancipation for women. Furthermore, in the Arab world,
   dominant patriarchal structures will only be challenged and changed when
   obstacles preventing women from enjoying their human rights and
   contributing fully in society are addressed and eliminated.},

Title = {Monitoring the Mediterranean type forests and land-use/cover changes
   using appropriate landscape metrics and hybrid classification approach
   in Eastern Mediterranean of Turkey},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},

Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Monitoring the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) is an important tool to
   evaluate the reasons for environmental changes in ecologically sensitive
   landscapes like natural forestlands. Rural landscapes are of vital
   importance for ecosystem productivity, ecosystem services, and
   biological diversity to continue sustainably. The purpose of this paper
   was to detect LUCC and its effects on landscape ecology through
   landscape metrics in the Eastern Mediterranean of Turkey. In this study,
   a hybrid classification approach was used to classify the Land-Use/Cover
   (LUC) and detailed forest tree diversity considering topography, plant
   density, and satellite waveband reflectance values. To this extent,
   detailed LUC classification, LUCC analyses from 2003 to 2014, habitat
   quality differences by generating landscape metrics in two levels are
   called landscape and class-level metrics were carried out in the study
   area. Habitat quality evaluation on forest formation scale using a
   hybrid classification approach provided a great advantage and made it
   possible to examine the landscape metrics of the plant types within the
   scope of temporal change. The study method was implemented in seven
   stages including: (1) classification of forest-no forestlands with the
   K-Means algorithm, (2) creating a data set of reflected signals over
   stand types, (3) determining the rules and thresholds of decision tree
   algorithm, (4) object-based classification of agricultural, rocky, and
   settlement areas, (5) obtaining the land-cover maps for 2003 and 2014,
   (6) post-classification change detection analyses, and (7) assessing the
   habitat quality via landscape metrics. The results indicated that forest
   areas increased by 10.73\%, while bare soil decreased by 17.70\% in 12
   years. The habitat quality increased in the same period in the study
   area according to the results of class area, mean shape index, mean
   patch size index, edge density, patch number, and Shannon's diversity
   index values.},

Abstract = {Satellite technology has been used over the years by the countries the
   world over with the benefits percolating down to the society. It has
   contributed in revolutionising communications, improving natural
   resources management systems, facilitating the study of agriculture
   potential and in various fields of economic development. Satellites have
   also been used for surveillance, emergency preparedness and coordinating
   search and rescue operations on a global basis. A unique benefit of this
   technology has been realised in the area of navigation and
   radiopositioning.
   Satellite based navigation and radiopositioning was first implemented by
   the USA with the launch of TRANSIT System. TRANSIT had paved the way for
   worldwide acceptance of satellite navigation although its use, life and
   accuracy of position fixing were limited. These limitations were
   overcome with the introduction of concept of Global Positioning System
   (GPS). GPS was conceived in 1974 by the USA as a better and faster
   navigation system capable of providing three dimensional position and
   velocity information along-with precise time to all types of users
   anywhere on a 24 hours basis. GPS provides for two levels of services
   i.e. Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service
   (PPS). The SPS is intended to provide a position fix that is accurate to
   within 100 meters on 95 percent of occasions, whereas PPS requires
   transfer from Coarse (C/A) code to the more accurate Precision (P) code,
   which allows accuracy of 16 meters on 50 percent of occasions.
   The accuracy of 100 meters available to civil users through SPS may not
   meet the requirements of applications in offshore oil exploration,
   hydrographic survey, physical oceanographic operation, fixing, collision
   avoidance, harbour approach and landing of aircraft, geophysical survey
   of remote locations and conducting search and rescue operations etc.
   This degraded accuracy can however be improved using the concept of
   Differential GPS (DGPS).
   This article deals with various issues related to the GPS technologies,
   their potential applications and system configurations available for
   these applications. An approach for design, development and
   demonstration of GPS and DGPS in Indian conditions with the active
   participation of user departments, industries and R\&D institutions
   engaged in this field has also been discussed. Since the GPS/DGPS is a
   system with potential of revolutionising the concepts in navigation and
   radiopositioning applications, it is hoped that this article will pave
   the way for promoting developmental activities for GPS/DGPS and Indian
   industries will gear up to meet the large requirements anticipated in
   near future for these.},

Title = {Delta dynamics: Effects of a major earthquake, tides, and river flows on
   Cienega de Santa Clara and the Colorado River Delta, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {144-156},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intertidal portion of Mexico's Colorado River Delta is a dynamic
   environment subject to complex interactions of tectonic, fluvial, and
   tidal forces at the head of the Gulf of California. We review the
   historical interactions of these forces, use sequential satellite
   images, overflights, ground observations, and interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (InSAR) data to study the effects of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El
   Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake on changing patterns of tidal inundation within
   the Delta, and assess effects of these changes to the
   fluvial/hydrological regime of the Colorado River estuary and nearby
   Cienega de Santa Clara wetland. The objectives of this study are to
   highlight for environmental scientists, land managers, and ecological
   engineers the contribution of tectonic forces in shaping the intertidal
   Delta environment and to provide information on the effects of the 2010
   earthquake which will be of practical value in planning and designing
   management measures and restoration projects for the estuary and
   Cienega.
   The Colorado River estuary is at present blocked by a tidal sand bar
   which restricts access by marine species to the upper estuary and
   obstructs the flow of fresh water into the lower estuary. Located 13 km
   east of the estuary, the Cienega is a 6000 ha wetland supported by
   agricultural drain water from Arizona and Mexico. South of the Cienega
   is the Santa Clara Slough, an unvegetated 26,000 ha basin subject to
   periodic inundation from the northern Gulf's high amplitude tides, which
   have historically reached the margins of the Cienega several times each
   year.
   The El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake ruptured the previously unknown Indiviso
   Fault which extends into the intertidal zone just west of the Cienega.
   The Cienega experienced only minor surface deformation having no direct
   effects to the wetland. Most of the significant ground movement and
   surface deformation occurred west of the Indiviso Fault adjacent to the
   estuary, where portions of the intertidal flats underwent extensive
   liquefaction, northward coseismic displacement and post-seismic
   subsidence. These surface deformations changed the pattern of tidal
   inundation, triggering development of a new system of natural tidal
   channels and creating conditions favorable for installation of projects
   to restore connectivity between the upper and lower estuary. The changed
   pattern of tidal inundation may also have contributed to an observed
   reduction in the occurrence of tidal flooding along the southwestern
   margin of the Cienega following the earthquake. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Detecting collective behaviour in animal relocation data, with
   application to migrating caribou},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Collective behaviour can allow populations to have emergent responses
   to uncertain environments, driven by simple interactions among nearby
   individuals. High-throughput ethological studies, where individual
   behaviour is closely observed in each member of a population (typically
   in the laboratory or by simulation), have revealed that collective
   behaviour in populations requires only rudimentary cognitive abilities
   in individuals and could therefore represent a widespread adaptation to
   life in an uncertain world. However, the ecological significance of
   collective behaviour is not yet well understood, as most studies to date
   have been confined to specialized situations that allow intensive
   monitoring of individual behaviour.
   2. Here, we describe a way to screen for collective behaviour in
   ecological data that is sampled at a coarser resolution than the
   underlying behavioural processes. We develop and test the method in the
   context of a well-studied model for collective movement in a noisy
   environmental gradient. The large-scale distribution patterns associated
   with collective behaviour are difficult to distinguish from the
   aggregated responses of independent individuals in this setting because
   independent individuals also align to track the gradient. However, we
   show that collective idiosyncratic deviations from the mean gradient
   direction have high predictive value for detecting collective behaviour.
   We describe a method of testing for these deviations using the average
   normalized velocity of the population.
   3. We demonstrate the method using data from satellite tracking collars
   on the migration patterns of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), recovering
   evidence that collective behaviour is a key driver of caribou migration
   patterns. We find moreover that the relative importance of collective
   behaviour fluctuates seasonally, concurrent with the timing of migration
   and reproduction.
   4. Collective behaviour is a potentially widespread dynamic property of
   populations that can, in some cases, be detected in coarsely sampled
   ecological data.},

Title = {Response of Global Particulate-Matter-Related Mortality to Changes in

Abstract = {Recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessments estimated that outdoor
   fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) is a causal factor in over 5\% of global
   premature deaths. PM2.5 is produced by a variety of direct and indirect,
   natural and anthropogenic processes that complicate PM2.5 management.
   This study develops a proof-of-concept method to quantify the effects on
   global premature mortality of changes to PM2.5 precursor emissions.
   Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we
   calculated sensitivities of global PM2.5-related premature mortality to
   emissions of precursor gases (SO2, NO, NH3) and carbonaceous aerosols.
   We used a satellite-derived ground-level PM2.5 data set at approximately
   10 x 10 km(2) resolution to better align the exposure with population
   density. We used exposureresponse functions from the GBD project to
   relate mortality to exposure in the adjoint calculation. The response of
   global mortality to changes in local anthropogenic emissions varied
   spatially by several orders of magnitude. The largest reductions in
   mortality for a 1 kg kM(-2) yr(-1) decrease in emissions were for
   ammonia and carbonaceous aerosols in Eastern Europe. The greatest
   reductions in mortality for a 10\% decrease in emissions were found for
   secondary inorganic sources in East Asia. In general, a 10\% decrease in
   SO2 emissions was the most effective source to control, but regional
   exceptions were found.},

Abstract = {For modelling and predicting soil indicators to be fully operational and
   facilitate decision-making at any spatial level, there is a requirement
   for precise spatially referenced soil information to be available as
   input data. This paper focuses on showing the capacity of
   Sentinal-2A(S2A) multispectral imaging to predict soil properties and
   provide geostatistical analysis (ordinary kriging) for mapping dry land
   soil fertility conditions (SOCs). Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling
   was used to select the representative sampling sites within the study
   area. To achieve the objectives of this work, 48 surface soil samples
   were collected from the western part of Matrouh Governorate, Egypt, and
   pH, soil organic matter (SOM), available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
   and potassium (K) levels were analyzed. Multilinear regression (MLR) was
   used to model the relationship between image reflectance and laboratory
   analysis (of pH, SOM, N, P, and K in the soil), followed by mapping the
   predicted outputs using ordinary kriging. Model fitting was achieved by
   removing variables according to the confidence level (95\%).Around 30\%
   of the samples were randomly selected to verify the validity of the
   results. The randomly selected samples helped express the variety of the
   soil characteristics from the investigated area. The predicted values of
   pH, SOM, N, P, and K performed well, with R-2 values of 0.6, 0.7, 0.55,
   0.6, and 0.92 achieved for pH, SOM, N, P, and K, respectively. The
   results from the ArcGIS model builder indicated a descending fertility
   order within the study area of: 70\% low fertility, 22\% moderate
   fertility, 3\% very low fertility, and 5\% reference terms. This work
   evidence that which can be predicted from S2A images and provides a
   reference for soil fertility monitoring in drylands. Additionally, this
   model can be easily applied to environmental conditions similar to those
   of the studied area.},

Title = {Can the watershed non-point source phosphorus flux amount be reflected
   by lake sediment?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {An understanding of the quantitative relationship between watershed
   non-point source (NPS) pollution and lake nutrient enrichment is
   essential for the environmental management of water bodies. However, a
   lack of data availability and integration limit our understanding of
   this relationship. The most critical bottlenecks are the lack of
   adequate support for watershed-lake integrated data, a lack of data of
   the nutrient loading from watersheds into a lake as NPS, and the
   long-term time series data of lake nutrient concentrations. Since lake
   sediment is the ultimate destination of watershed nutrients, this study
   aimed to reveal the relationship between watershed phosphorus (P)
   concentrations that are transported into lakes and lake P concentrations
   by using inlet sediments as an indicator. Three typical sub-basins
   within Hongze Lake, China were selected as the study site, and 30-year
   dataset was calculated using the technology integration of remote
   sensing, sediment chemical analysis and SWAT model assessment. It can be
   concluded that, first, the Mineral-P (Min-P) accounted for nearly 65\%
   of the watershed Total P (TP) loss, which varied over different basins
   and temporal periods. Second, the relationship between watershed P loss
   into lakes and sediment P concentrations represented obvious variation
   among different basins, sediment depths and P states. With respect to
   different basins, the highest correlation appeared in Basin 1, which had
   a R-2 value of 0.65 for Min-P. With respect to different P states, the
   Inorganic-P (IP) showed a closer relationship between watershed and lake
   P than Organic-P (OP), and the correlation coefficient (r) was higher
   than 0.6 in Basin 1 and Basin 3 for IP. In addition, the
   calcium-phosphorus ratio (Ca-P), which is largely sourced from watershed
   rock detritus by eroded runoff, played the most critical role among
   different Min-P states in the relatively ideal relationship of IP. With
   respect to different sediment depths, a stratification phenomenon
   existed in Basin 2 and Basin 3, which differed at specific depths. In
   particular, the ideal relationship only existed within the 7 cm depth
   from the bottom in basin 2, and this value expands to 10 cm for basin 3.
   This diversity was influenced by the integration roles from external and
   endogenous sources. All the findings indicated that lake surface
   sediment can be used as a proxy to represent NPS P loading under
   specific conditions. The relationship between watershed P loss and lake
   sediment P concentration was largely decided by land use/cover change
   (LUCC), meteorological conditions, and lake resuspension.},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate acquisition of crop area is of great significance
   for monitoring crop growth and estimation of crop yields. And it's
   important for strengthening agricultural management, ensuring food
   security and supply of agricultural products. The combination of remote
   sensing data with traditional sampling methods is an effective way to
   monitor and estimate crop area on a large scale. The traditional
   sampling method, on the basis of traditional statistics theory which
   studies the laws of random variables, requires that the sampling units
   should satisfy the principle of mutual independence. However, the
   regional crops, which are affected by natural conditions and
   socioeconomic factors, are often spatial variable. There is no report on
   whether and how spatial variability will influence the sampling
   efficiency of crop acreage. Therefor the further improvement of sampling
   efficiency is limited. To solve this problem, a variation function model
   was constructed with the area ratio between maize or rice and sampling
   units as object variable on 10 sampling unit scales combining remote
   sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods with
   Dehui, Jilin as study area. Selecting base value as index for spatial
   variability within the sampling unit, the effect of sampling unit scales
   on spatial variability of maize and rice were quantitatively analyzed.
   Three commonly used sampling schemes (random sampling, systematic
   sampling and stratified sampling) were selected for sample selection,
   overall extrapolation and error estimation. The sampling efficiency was
   quantitatively evaluated using overall relative error (r) of the
   sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total
   estimate and the sample size (n) on different sampling unit scales. The
   results show that the spatial variability of maize and rice decreases
   with the increase of the sampling unit scale. The range of base value is
   {[}0.15, 0.20] and {[}0.05, 0.14] for maize and wheat respectively.
   Using the three sampling methods to extrapolate the maize and rice area
   separately: 1) Under the same sampling ratio, the relative sampling
   errors of the two crops' area estimations gradually increase with the
   decrease of spatial variability (the sampling unit size increases), the
   coefficient of variation also shows an increasing trend, and the
   sampling accuracy and extrapolation stability is affected by spatial
   variability; 2) The relative error in estimation of the two crop areas
   varies with the sampling method,when using simple random sampling and
   systematic sampling, the relative error of the two crops was within the
   range of (1`)/0, 50\%) and (0.5\%, 40\%), and the coefficient of
   variation was limited to (1\%, 75 A) and In the range of (1\%, 88\%),
   the relative errors at all scales were limited to 10\% or less with
   stratified sampling, and the fluctuations of the coefficient of
   variation were small (both within 0.3\% and 20\%). Therefore, the
   stratification was selected. Sampling is the best sampling method; 3)
   When the sampling method is determined, the sampling ratio is the main
   factor determining the sampling efficiency.
   As the sampling ratio increases, the rate of change of the relative
   error of the two crop area estimators gradually decreases, when the
   sampling fraction reaches S\%, The relative error is basically limited
   to 5\%, and the coefficient of variation is stable within 12\% On this
   basis, the effect of increasing the sampling ratio to increase the
   sampling progress is minimal; 4) According to the conclusions of 2) and
   3), Stratified sampling method is used to extrapolate crop area by 5\%
   sampling ratio. The sampling efficiency decreases with the increase of
   sampling unit size. When the sampling unit size is limited within
   3500mx3500m, the overall sampling satisfies 95\% sampling accuracy
   requirements., And the coefficient of variation is stable within 7\%,
   the stability of the extrapolation of the area is also high; 5) Based on
   the above research conclusions, the quantitative evaluation sampling
   efficiency scheme and the optimal sampling model composed of the
   combination of sampling unit scale (spatial variability), sampling
   fraction, extrapolated total relative error, and variation coefficient
   were finally obtained. This study provides a reference for the design of
   a rational spatial sampling schemes of spatial variable crops.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution provides valuable information for
   quantifying NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions and exposures. This study
   presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2
   emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018-June 2022) TROPOspheric
   Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a
   wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the
   so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly
   applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and
   yields a total emission rate of 1:09 x 1026 molec. s(-1). The ML-trained
   anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R-2
   value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent
   at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over
   areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1 :99
   x 10(25) molec. s(-1) is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area,
   Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the
   Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. Weekly
   variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic
   activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced
   by 16\% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the
   city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction
   estimate of 28\% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources
   are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the
   Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19
   lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21\% in March-June 2020 in
   Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction
   (62 \%) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was
   implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in
   the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared
   with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during
   lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities.
   Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the
   method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is
   expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions.
   However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated
   emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in
   different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These
   impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further

Abstract = {The development of Polish cities leads to the urbanization of the
   surrounding rural areas. The National Urban Development Plan until 2030
   has introduced the concept of obligatory green belts around metropolitan
   and regional hubs to prevent uncontrolled suburbanization. This study
   analyzes the distribution and spatial continuity of forests and the
   spatial relationships (spatial autocorrelations) between the forests
   situated in the rural suburbia of Olsztyn, north-eastern Poland. The aim
   of the analysis was to evaluate the spatial continuity of forests by
   grouping similar objects and identifying areas which could he included
   in green belts. The location quotient (LQ) and the Gini coefficient were
   taken into account in the analysis of the spatial distribution of
   forests. Local Moran's statistics were calculated and spatial clusters
   were identified to illustrate the diversity of the examined suburban
   space based on the similarity of the neighbouring objects (cadastral
   districts) and to determine the statistical significance of these
   relationships. The results of the study reveal spatial irregularities
   and disproportions in the distribution of forests in the suburban zone
   of Olsztyn as well as the presence of local instabilities and
   discontinuities. The municipalities surrounding Olsztyn are
   characterized by relatively high density of forests which build a green
   belt. The Values of the location quotient in the analyzed cadastral
   districts and the values of the Gini coefficient point to moderately
   uniform spatial distribution of forests in Olsztyn suburban area. The
   low values of LQ in the districts situated along the eastern and
   southern boundaries of Olsztyn denote lower availability of forests and,
   consequently, lower quality of life. The applied methods are useful
   tools for evaluating, planning and optimizing the spatial distribution
   of forests around large urban centres.},

Title = {Potential Benefits and Shortcomings of Marine Protected Areas for Small
   Seabirds Revealed Using Miniature Tags},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas are considered important tools for protecting
   marine biodiversity, and animal tracking is a key way to determine if
   boundaries are effectively placed for protection of key marine species,
   including seabirds. We tracked chick-rearing brown noddies (Anus
   stolidus) from the Dry Tortugas National Park in Florida USA in 2016
   using 1.8 g Nanofix GPS tags (n = 10), making this the first time this
   species has ever been tracked. We determined movement parameters, such
   as flight speed, distance traveled and home range, and how birds used a
   complex of marine protected areas including the Dry Tortugas National
   Park which is largely no-take (i.e., no fishing or extraction
   permitted), and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, of which two
   Ecological Reserves totaling 517.9 km(2) are no-take. Birds remained
   largely within marine protected areas, with 91.3\% of birds' locations
   and 58.8\% of the birds' total home range occurring within the MPAs, and
   79.2\% of birds' locations and 18.2\% of the birds' total home range
   within no-take areas. However, areas of probable foraging, indicated by
   locations where birds had high-residence time, were found within one of
   the MPAs only 64.7\% of the time, and only 6.7\% of those locations were
   in no-take areas. Birds traveled a mean straight line distance from the
   colony of 37.5 km, primarily using the region to the southwest of the
   colony where the shelf break and Loop Current occur. High-residence-time
   locations were found in areas of significantly higher sea surface
   temperature and closer to the shelf break than low residency locations.
   A sea surface temperature front occurs near the shelf edge, likely
   indicative of where Sargassum seaweed is entrained, providing habitat
   for forage species. Much of this region, however, falls outside the
   boundaries of the marine protected areas, and brown noddies and other
   species breeding in the Dry Tortugas may interact with fisheries via
   resource competition or discard foraging. The complex of marine
   protected areas in the region encompasses a large portion of the overall
   habitat for this small seabird species, however a large portion of the
   key foraging habitat fell outside the boundaries of the marine protected
   areas. This study highlights areas for potential management changes
   including the protection of additional areas, and the importance of
   advanced tracking technology for management of marine species.},

Title = {Immediate disturbances induced by tropical cyclone Fani on the coastal
   forest landscape of eastern India: A geospatial analysis},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An extremely severe tropical cyclone Fani made its landfall on 3rd May,
   2019 along the coastal region of Odisha, India causing profound damage
   to its natural and human resources. This study examines the immediate
   effects of the cyclone on vegetation dynamics and patterns of canopy gap
   formation in Balukhand Wildlife Sanctuary of this region. Sentinel 2A
   data of pre and post-Fani scenarios were used to derive Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and relevant landscape metrics of
   patch and class levels for this forest from coast (zone A) to inland
   (zone C). Results showed that even the maximum NDVI values of the
   post-cyclone scenario were either less than or equal to the mean NDVI
   values of the pre-cyclone scenario for most of the grids of three zones.
   Among the twenty three grids, severe damage was identified in seven
   grids mostly covering western parts of the forest owing to high levels
   of exploitative human interventions. Species like Casuarina
   equisetifolia and Eucalyptus globulus had suffered the most. The
   individual as well as combined interactions of land cover and cyclone
   scenario were found to have significantly strong effects on patch metric
   values (p < 0.01) in three-way analysis of variance. Regarding canopy
   gaps, zone A was characterized by clusters of few large patches (> 1 ha
   area; > 400 m perimeter) and multiple tiny patches but canopies of zone
   B and C were primarily perforated through multitudes of tiny, irregular
   cum amorphous gaps. Zone-wise ecological restoration was recommended to
   mitigate the statistically significant losses of vegetated patches (p <
   0.001) due to the cyclone and accordingly relevant species were
   suggested for site-specific plantation.},

Title = {CLIMATIC AND HYDROLOGICAL FACTORS OPERATING IN THE AREA OF LEADING LINE
   FOR CONSTRUCTION OF BRIDGE ``SAKHALIN-CONTINENT{''}},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {The expediency of transportation on the TRANS-Siberian railway is not in
   doubt for any of our contemporaries now, and its importance for
   development of Siberia and the Far East is quite obvious. However, this
   attitude to this transport artery was not formed immediately. Let us
   recall at least the fact that the Tomsk merchant class insisted that the
   road passed through Aleksandrovsk (now Novosibirsk). The decision of
   Tsar Alexander III on construction of the railway played crucial role.
   The built road contributed to the development of the cities through
   which it was laid. The situation with the decision on organization of
   the free movement from the mainland to Sakhalin seems to us similar to
   the one that was in front of laying of the line across Siberia. The
   issue will have to be addressed sooner or later. The laying of the
   highway to the island will give a powerful impetus to the social and
   economic development of the territories adjacent to the road and
   railway, which will pass through the bridge. In this article, we
   research specifics of climatic and hydrological factors that determine
   choice of type of hydraulic structures in the Nevelskogo Strait.
   The relevance of the research is dictated by the need for comprehensive
   review of the conditions that determine the choice of the Tatar Strait
   crossing line by the bridge. After taking into account the influence of
   geological and geomorphological factors, we turn our attention to
   climatic, weather and hydrological processes that will have a permanent
   impact on construction and operation.
   The aim of the research is to link together and analyze the data that
   characterize features of atmospheric and hydrosphere processes in narrow
   part of the Tatar Strait and conduct scientific research that will
   complement for engineering research and help identify based on
   simulation safest opening for construction of hydro-technical utilities
   that will connect opposite banks.
   Materials and methods. The materials for the study were cartographic
   materials, data of remote sensing of the Earth, information on climatic
   and weather conditions, data of hydrological, meteorological,
   Oceanographic observations, information obtained as a result of research
   works and engineering surveys in which the authors participated, as well
   as information from literary sources. Mapping in the geographic
   information environment allowed creating thematic maps reflecting the
   dynamics of hydrometeorological processes. The obtained information was
   used in construction of models of water circulation, formation and
   degradation of ice cover in the Nevelskoy Strait with the use of
   geoinformation technologies. The authors took a direct part in research
   of the leading line ``Novy{''} in 2001. As result of the research of the
   features of hydrometeorological conditions within the water area of the
   Nevelskogo Strait and its coasts, based on satellite monitoring data,
   observations at nearby weather stations, as well as confirmed by
   information obtained during engineering surveys, it was found that in
   area of the Nevelskoy Strait, adverse natural phenomena should be taken
   into account when choosing technical design solutions for selecting type
   of bridge or tunnel construction from mainland to Sakhalin. The spatial
   and temporal distribution of radiance in the area is due to astronomical
   reasons, decrease in duration of the sunshine in De-Kastri and Pogibi
   compared to Nikolaevsk-on-Amur is associated with frequent fogs that
   occur during atmospheric processes on border of land and sea. Extreme
   values of air temperature in Pogibi were registered at the Pogibi
   weather station - maximum of 27,3 degrees C and a minimum of -44,0
   degrees C. Index of continentality is very high (amplitude - 71,3
   degrees C), which can be explained by the influence of air masses
   removal from mainland in winter period. The important indicator for
   projecting - duration of frost-free period-ranges in Pogibi from 88 to
   186 days (average - 137). Daily precipitation totals during warm period
   reached maximum values of 88 mm in October, 81 mm in August, and 78 mm
   in July. Snow cover in Pogibi lasts from 153 to 216 days. Winds of >= 30
   m/s occur annually in spring and autumn, sometimes exceeding 40 m/s.
   Fogs in described area are observed throughout year. Snowstorms in
   strait and on its coastal are very common. Any increase in wind in
   winter is accompanied by blizzard transfer of snow. Thunderstorms occur
   4-5 times a year. Dust storms are rare. Horizontal water circulation in
   the Northern part of strait is anticyclical in winter, and cyclonic
   circulation is active from May to September. In general, in spring water
   movement speed on surface is 2-7 cm/s and in summer it decreases to 1-4
   cm/s. Changes in sea level in the Tatar Strait are in the range of
   3,2-4,0 m. Duration of ice period at time moderate types of winters is
   201 days. Collar ice in Pogibi in late March - early April averages 160
   cm and varies from 119 to 190 cm depending on type of winter. Due to the
   strong tidal currents, the solid ice cover in channel of the middle part
   of strait is formed very rarely and on short time. The result of the
   increased ice cover dynamics is multiple layers of young ice up to 30 cm
   thick. Coastals in southern part of Strait are resistant to abrasion
   processes and practically do not collapse. The area enclosed between
   liding lines Lazarev cape - cape Pogibi in the North and cape South -
   cape Tyk - in the South has the most favorable conditions for the
   construction of bridge.
   Climatic and hydrological conditions throughout have relative
   similarity, which allowed us distinguish it when zoning as independent
   unit. The performed research allows us give an advantage to leading line
   ``Novy{''} (cape Nevelskogo - cape Lakh).},

Abstract = {The value of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in a multitude
   of both military and civilian navigation and timing applications has
   been indisputably shown over the last twenty plus years. Increased
   dependence on GNSS has driven the need for risk management in using
   these systems for critical operations. One example risk reduction is
   through use of an integrity monitoring process, a process which predicts
   the impact of a worst case or minimal detectable bias error on the
   navigation position error. The navigation community has spent nearly two
   decades in development of GNSS integrity algorithms and continues to
   refine methodologies and investigate new approaches. As a result, the
   concept of integrity has been formalized for GPS to encompass
   fundamental criteria, including the ability to detect measurement errors
   and notify the user when the system should not be used because of
   potentially corrupt measurements.
   More recently, researchers have begun investigating the potential use of
   image-based navigation systems for applications where GNSS signals are
   not available or should not be used. Independence from external
   radio-frequency transmissions and potentially low-cost implementations
   of cam-era and image processing suites are among the key advantages of
   these newer systems. However, while larger issues of integrity are
   seemingly well-understood for many GNSS applications, to the best
   knowledge of the authors, no one has fully addressed rigorous integrity
   quantification with respect to image-based navigation systems.
   This paper details the research into the impact of attitude in an
   image-based integrity framework. With image measurements, the attitude
   can either be solved for directly, or it can be considered known (such
   as if the camera was mounted to an INS with a sufficiently-good attitude
   determination capability to be considered a known attitude). The paper
   then describes how image-based integrity can be calculated for both
   known and unknown attitude cases. The benefit of having known attitude
   is then quantified. These results show that, from an integrity
   perspective, there is a significant benefit of having known attitude
   information. This result implies that for cases in which integrity is
   important, it is highly valuable to have some sort of attitude
   measurement capability (such as an inertial navigation system).},

Abstract = {Aims:To develop and validate case definitions to identify patients with
   cirrhosis and alcohol-related cirrhosis using primary care electronic
   medical records (EMRs) and to estimate cirrhosis prevalence and
   incidence in pan-Canadian primary care database, between 2011 and
   2019.Methods:A total of 689,301 adult patients were included with >= 1
   visit to a primary care provider within the Canadian Primary Care
   Sentinel Study Network between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018.
   Subsample of 17,440 patients was used to validate the case definitions.
   Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated with their
   95\% confidence intervals (CI) and then determined the population-level
   prevalence and incidence trends with the most accurate case
   definition.Results:The most accurate case definition included: >= 1
   health condition, billing, or encounter diagnosis for International
   Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 571.2, 571.5, 789.59,
   or 571. Sensitivity (84.6; 95\% CI: 83.1-86.\%), specificity (99.3; 95\%
   CI: 99.1-99.4\%), positive predictive values (94.8; 95\% CI:
   93.9-95.7\%), and negative predictive values (97.5; 95\% CI:
   97.3-97.7\%). Application of this definition to the overall population
   resulted in a crude prevalence estimate of (0.46\%, 95\% CI:
   0.45\%-0.48\%). Annual incidence of patients with a clinical diagnosis
   of cirrhosis nearly doubled between 2011 (0.05\%, 95\% CI:
   0.04\%-0.06\%) and 2019 to (0.09\%, 95\% CI:
   0.08\%-0.09\%).Conclusions:The EMR-based case definition accurately
   captured patients diagnosed with cirrhosis in primary care. Future work
   to characterize patients with cirrhosis and their primary care
   experiences can support improvements in identification and management in
   primary care settings.},

Note = {Meeting on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Whistler, CANADA,
   SEP, 2006},
Abstract = {There is a continuing increase in gastroesophageal reflux disease
   (GERD), its diverse manifestations and complications worldwide. Indeed
   the substantial increase in Asia remains is a major epidemiologic and a
   developing health care issue. This manifesto provides a contemporary
   review of the current status of areas of uncertainty and in particular
   highlights the lack of knowledge and unmet needs in the field of GERD
   biology and especially management. There seems to be no widely accepted
   rationale for the increasing incidence and prevalence of GERD globally.
   Although consideration has been given to the decline in Helicobacter
   pylori infection, others consider the steadily growing problem of
   obesity as the most likely etiologic factor. What actually comprises the
   disease entity of GERD continues to confound physicians, and the steady
   increase in new definitions suggests that a clear picture is still
   emerging. Of note, however, is the rising awareness of its protean
   systemic manifestations and the fact that while erosive reflux disease
   is easily recognizable endoscopically, nonerosive disease (NERD)
   comprises the majority of presentations in many populations. In view of
   this, GERD-specific questionnaires and other evaluative tools have been
   designed to capture the multidimensional nature of the symptom complexes
   in GERD patients who for the most part may have no endoscopic evidence
   of disease. Such tools have obvious utility in the evaluation of changes
   with treatment, especially because there is no endoscopic abnormality
   detectable. The recognition that NERD is becoming a major clinical
   entity that requires substantial further investigation is now clearly
   apparent. At this time, however, little is known of the cellular barrier
   mechanisms of the esophagus and what is responsible for their
   reconstitution after injury. Similarly, the neural basis of esophageal
   pain appreciation, or its relation to the visceral sensory mechanisms
   that may link NERD with aspects of functional bowel disease are as yet
   ill understood. Apart from the clinical concern with symptom-focused
   issues, it is the specter of Barrett esophagus, the most-feared
   complication of GERD that mostly continues to drive endoscopic practice
   in GERD. At this time, however, current surveillance strategies remain
   severely limited in their ability to adequately detect or prevent most
   esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although considerable effort has been
   directed at defining the neural circuitry of the esophagus in terms of
   both motility and sensation, the topography and function of the
   esophageal-brain-gut axis in respect of the generation of esophageal
   symptoms remains terra incognita. At this time therefore acid
   suppression remains the mainstay of therapy in terms of treating the
   GERD/NERD disease process. Despite the efficacy of the currently
   available proton pump inhibitor class of drugs, there are clearly unmet
   needs in this area and agents with a more rapid onset of action and
   prolonged effect, particularly at night remain important goals in the
   future advance of pharmacotherapy.},

Title = {The feasibility study of offshore wind energy potential in Kijal,
   Malaysia: the new alternative energy source exploration in Malaysia},
Journal = {ENERGY EXPLORATION \& EXPLOITATION},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {329-344},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many countries have been endeavoring to explore and exploit
   the offshore wind energy in terms of solving the problem of limitations
   of onshore wind energy. Wind energy is one of potential alternative for
   generating electricity in Malaysia. The offshore wind speed is better
   compared to onshore, so there is more potential contribution by offshore
   wind power in terms of electricity generation. This paper provides a
   summary of the offshore wind resources of the Kijal, Malaysia by
   analyzing the QuikSCAT satellite data which is available and can be
   downloaded from the WindPRO application. Based on these datasets, wind
   resources are assessed, and economical efficiency is evaluated by means
   of the expected capacity factor. Research was conducted using WindPRO
   and WAsP software to assess the potential of wind energy along the South
   China Sea in Kijal, Terengganu. Seven models of the wind turbines with
   different rated power; 110kW, 225kW, 275kW, 600kW, 850kW, 1000kW and
   1250kW are taken for energy and economic feasibility analyses. The wind
   turbine with rated power 850 kW was indicated as the best wind turbine
   for installation in Kijal based on its best capacity factor, 26.8\% In
   economical aspect, Malaysia does not have Feed in Tariff (FiT) rates for
   offshore wind projects, thus the range of predicted FiT rates, RM 0.30
   to RM 2.00 were tested by using Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback
   Period (PBP) calculation. Finally, the conducive FiT rates for wind
   projects with secured investment were identified and the rates were in
   range RM 0.80 to RM 1.38. The overall results suggest that the wind
   energy has a bright future for use as an alternative source for
   generating electricity in Kijal, Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Eastern coastal area along Guangdong province is one of the economically
   developed regions in China which has experienced a lot of changes in its
   land-use patterns. It has become necessary to detect the changes
   happened in this region as this may help determining the level of stress
   that the coastal zone is facing and improving the management of the
   coastal resource. Based on the land use data acquired from the large
   scale land surveys in China in early 1980s and interpreted data from
   satellite images of 2005, the land use/cover change was detected in this
   area within this period. The result demonstrates that during the past 20
   years, land use changed dramatically in the study area, which
   characterized by a significant reduction in arable land, degradation of
   wetlands and the increasing of artificial area. At the same time the
   spatial distribution of the change was very uneven. The most obvious
   change occurred in Pearl River estuary section which is also the
   economic center of Guangdong province. Because farmers wanted to gain
   more economic benefits, much plantation land took place at the cost of a
   large reduction of the proportion of agricultural area. The change in
   the centre and east part of the coastal zone was comparatively small.
   The dominated land use types in these areas were still agriculture land
   and forest land which was as same as that in early 1980s.},

Abstract = {The technological innovations in information and communications
   technology have hastened the arrival and reality of digital data and
   picture transmission. They have made us dependent on media. The digital
   signal is a transmission technology that carries more information than
   the previous analogue network. In addition, the digital signal has the
   capacity to transmit bulk information and a constant signal strength,
   irrespective of the distance from the transmitter within a given
   coverage area (New Zealand Ministry of Culture and Heritage, 2010).
   Therefore, all countries are urged to migrate from analogue to digital
   broadcasting. The lack of research on the effects of digital migration
   on the socio-economic contingencies led to this study, the aim of which
   was to establish the impact of digital migration on socio-economic
   factors in Namibia. A questionnaire and interview survey instrument was
   distributed to retailers and viewers of the Namibian Broadcasting
   Corporation (NBC). An analysis of the data collected reveals that the
   majority of the respondents used decoders from Digital Satellite
   Television (DStv) and GoTV. However, some elements of the findings show
   that some viewers could be adversely affected by the costs involved in
   digital migration. The findings show that more is required from the NBC
   to ensure that the population experiences minimum negative impact of
   digital migration. Digital migration is presumed to result in
   socioeconomic benefits to viewers, coupled with additional investment in
   broadcasting media as well as the production of local content. The
   current increase in local content popularity gives confidence to local
   producers, writers and workers in the broadcasting industry. The
   research recommends, for the purposes of maintaining good socio-economic
   standards, that the NBC use both the analogue and digital systems
   concurrently.},

Abstract = {Background Radiotherapy can induce cardiac injury in left-sided breast
   cancer cases. Cardiac-sparing irradiation using the deep inspiration
   breath-hold (DIBH) technique can achieve substantial dose reduction to
   vulnerable cardiac substructures compared with free breathing (FB). This
   study evaluated the dosimetric differences between both techniques at a
   single institution. Methods From 2017 to 2019, 130 patients with
   left-sided breast cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS; n =
   121, 93.1\%) or mastectomy (ME; n = 9, 6.9\%) along with axillary lymph
   node staging (n = 105, 80.8\%), followed by adjuvant irradiation in DIBH
   technique; adjuvant systemic therapy was included if applicable. 106
   (81.5\%) patients received conventional and 24 (18.5\%) hypofractionated
   irradiation. Additionally, 12 patients received regional nodal
   irradiation. Computed tomography (CT) scans in FB and DIBH position were
   performed for all patients. Intrafractional 3D position monitoring of
   the patient surface in deep inspiration and breath gating was performed
   using Sentinel and Catalyst HD 3D surface scanning systems (C-RAD,
   Catalyst, C-RAD AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Individual coaching and
   determination of breathing amplitude during the radiation planning CT
   was performed. Three-dimensional treatment planning was performed using
   standard tangential treatment portals (6 or 18 MV). The delineation of
   cardiac structures and both lungs was done in both the FB and the DIBH
   scan. Results All dosimetric parameters for cardiac structures were
   significantly reduced (p < 0.01 for all). The mean heart dose (Dmean) in
   the DIBH group was 1.3 Gy (range 0.5-3.6) vs. 2.2 Gy (range 0.9-8.8) in
   the FB group (p < 0.001). The Dmean for the left ventricle (LV) in DIBH
   was 1.5 Gy (range 0.6-4.5), as compared to 2.8 Gy (1.1-9.5) with FB (p <
   0.001). The parameters for LV (V10 Gy, V15 Gy, V20 Gy, V23 Gy, V25 Gy,
   V30 Gy) were reduced by about 100\% (p < 0.001). The LAD Dmean in the
   DIBH group was 4.1 Gy (range 1.2-33.3) and 14.3 Gy (range 2.4-37.5) in
   the FB group (p < 0.001). The median values for LAD such as V15 Gy, V20
   Gy, V25 Gy, V30 Gy, and V40 Gy decreased by roughly 100\% (p < 0.001).
   An increasing volume of left lung in the DIBH position resulted in dose
   sparing of cardiac structures. Conclusion For all ascertained dosimetric
   parameters, a significant dose reduction could be achieved in DIBH
   technique.},

Title = {Sustainability Performance through Technology Adoption: A Case Study of
   Land Leveling in a Paddy Field},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy is required in all agricultural activities. Diagramming material
   flows needed by crop production systems supports the proper analysis of
   energy flows interactions within a system's boundaries. The latter
   complemented with an economic analysis gives a clear view of how
   beneficial a new practice within a crop cycle is-in this case, the
   variable slope (VS) land leveling (LL) operation. VS is a global
   navigation satellite system (GNSS, with real time
   kinematics-RTK-accuracy) LL technique used to create a smooth continuous
   surface with a constant slope, by cutting and filling topsoil layers
   only in those points presenting ``anomalies{''} of micro-relief which
   make the movement of water difficult. This operation is important for
   paddy production since: (i) it enables to crop during dry seasons by
   harnessing the water of rivers and wells, and (ii) improves the
   production during rainy seasons, by allowing the farmer to manage the
   drainage timely and homogeneously. The present study aims to analyze,
   from the energy perspective, the effects of the VS leveling
   implementation in a paddy field (located in the Costa Rican Pacific),
   throughout input (labor, gas oil, etc.) and output (yield and price)
   data of five consecutive years (2011-2015). A material flow diagram was
   created representing two scenarios: before and after leveling the land.
   The materials were converted into energy (MJ ha(-1)) data, used for the
   estimation of EROI (energy return on investment), EP (energy
   productivity) and EB (energy balance) indices, while looking for a
   clearer understanding of the LL impact on the use of energy within the
   agroecosystem. Moreover, in order to complement the energy perspective,
   an economic point of view was considered as well through a profitability
   analysis where the total gain obtained over the years with LL was
   compared with that obtained without LL. Results showed that the increase
   in energy consumed by incorporating VS leveling is compensated by the
   gradual increase of energy embodied in yield, increasing energy balance
   (EB) from 26,192 MJ ha(-1) up to 91,166 MJ ha(-1). Similarly, EROI and
   EP were duplicated with LL. Economic total gain after incorporating the
   VS increased from less than 500 USD ha(-1) up to 1800 USD ha(-1) in the
   third year after leveling. Yield is more affected under adverse weather
   conditions with irregular water supply, either limited or excessive; and
   effects are less pronounced when the yield limiting factor is associated
   with biotic stress unrelated to irrigation and drainage facts. An
   environmental positive impact should also be noted, since VS allowed the
   production benefits of having highly-efficient irrigation and drainage
   systems, while avoiding major damage to topsoil layers.},

Title = {Digital Norm Contestation and Feminist Foreign Policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 25},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of digital norm contestation in feminist
   foreign policy (FFP). It analyzes how states that participate in digital
   diplomacy are involved in challenging and resisting norms, values and
   expectations related to feminist positionings in the digital
   environment. The article presents an analytical framework for the study
   of digital norm contestation and conducts an empirical case study of
   Sweden as the first country in the world to brand its foreign policy
   ``feminist.{''} This triggered a process of digital norm contestation,
   particularly visible in the area of sexual and reproductive health and
   rights. Three empirical vignettes of digital norm contestation are
   analyzed. The first example illustrates how the Swedish government was
   able to exercise global leadership to visually perform and digitally
   advocate the contestation of the US global gag rule. The second example
   underlines how the Swedish government harnessed its leadership by
   connecting it to grassroots contestations of the global gag rule through
   digital advocacy networks. The third example illuminates how the Swedish
   government's visit to Iran backfired because of a lost sense of control
   over visual performative effects in the digital environment. By way of
   conclusion, we suggest three avenues that can be pursued to further the
   research agenda on gender, digital norm contestation, and foreign
   policy.
   Resumen: Este articulo estudia el papel que tiene la impugnacion de
   normas digitales dentro de la politica exterior feminista. El articulo
   analiza como los Estados que participan en la diplomacia digital se
   involucran en desafiar y en oponerse a normas, valores y expectativas
   relacionados con los posicionamientos feministas dentro del entorno
   digital. El articulo presenta un marco analitico para el estudio de la
   impugnacion de normas digitales y realiza un estudio de caso empirico
   sobre Suecia, por haber sido el primer pais del mundo en calificar su
   politica exterior de \& DLANGBRAC;feminista \& drangbrac;. Esto
   desencadeno un proceso de impugnacion de normas digitales, que tuvo una
   importante visibilidad en el area de la salud y los derechos sexuales y
   reproductivos. Se analizan tres ejemplos empiricos relativos a la
   impugnacion de normas digitales. El primer ejemplo ilustra como el
   Gobierno sueco pudo ejercer un liderazgo global para llevar a cabo de
   manera visual la impugnacion de la ley mordaza global de los Estados
   Unidos y abogar digitalmente por esta impugnacion. El segundo ejemplo
   destaca como el Gobierno sueco aprovecho su liderazgo para conectar con
   las impugnaciones de base de la ley mordaza global a traves de redes de
   defensa digital. El tercer ejemplo arroja luz sobre como fracaso la
   visita por parte del Gobierno sueco a Iran debido a la perdida de
   sentido de control sobre los efectos performativos visuales en el
   entorno digital. A modo de conclusion, sugerimos tres vias que se pueden
   seguir para promover la agenda relativa a la investigacion sobre genero,
   impugnacion de normas digitales y politica exterior.
   Resume: Cet article s'interesse au role de la contestation de la norme
   numerique en politique etrangere feministe. Il analyse le role des etats
   qui prennent part a la diplomatie numerique dans la remise en question
   et la resistance aux normes, valeurs et attentes liees aux
   positionnements feministes dans l'environnement numerique. L'article
   presente un cadre d'analyse pour l'etude de la contestation de la norme
   numerique avant de mener une etude de cas empirique de la Suede, premier
   pays au monde a qualifier sa politique etrangere de \& DLANGBRAC;
   feministe \& drangbrac;. Cette qualification a debouche sur un processus
   de contestation de la norme numerique, notamment visible dans le domaine
   de la sante et des droits sexuels et genesiques. L'analyse inclut trois
   exemples empiriques de contestation de la norme numerique. Le premier
   montre comment le gouvernement suedois a pu exercer un leadership
   mondial pour contester visiblement la regle du baillon mondiale des
   etats-Unis et promouvoir numeriquement cette contestation. Le deuxieme
   exemple illustre comment le gouvernement suedois a exploite ce
   leadership en le reliant aux contestations citoyennes de la regle de
   baillon mondiale grace a des reseaux de promotion numerique. Le
   troisieme met en lumiere comment la visite du gouvernement suedois en
   Iran s'est retournee contre lui, a cause de la perte du sentiment de
   controle des effets performatifs visuels dans l'environnement numerique.
   En gage de conclusion, nous proposons trois pistes d'exploration pour
   faire progresser le programme de recherche sur le genre, la contestation
   de la norme numerique et la politique etrangere.},

Abstract = {Demersal fish cannot readily be tracked using satellite-based or
   light-based geolocation techniques. As an alternative, we describe the
   tidal location method, which uses tidal data recorded by electronic data
   storage tags (DSTs), to determine geoposition. Times of high water (H)
   and tidal ranges (R) recorded by DSTs moored at known locations, and
   from free-swimming tagged plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, were compared
   with a North Sea tidal database to identify all positions with matching
   values of H and R. Within the recording precision of the tag (+/-0.2 m,
   +/-10 min) and the predicted accuracy of the model generated tidal data
   (+/-0.15 m, +/-20 min), geolocations over much of the North Sea and
   eastern English Channel were predicted to be accurate to within 40 kin,
   sometimes to within 10 km. Positional estimates of the moored tags were
   within 15.7+/-3.5 km of the actual locations. Geolocations made from
   tagged plaice within 5 days of release and 5 days pre-recapture were
   within 35+/-24 km and 37+/-23 km of release and recapture positions
   respectively. Our results demonstrate the ability of this method to
   accurately describe the migrations of North Sea plaice throughout their
   geographical range with a level of accuracy unattainable using
   light-based geolocation. The method could equally be applied to any
   shelf-dwelling demersal fish that periodically rests on the sea-bed for
   the duration of a tidal cycle. In fisheries management, the method has
   clear potential application in defining the movements and migrations of
   other commercial species.},

Title = {The Proportionality Principle as a Tool for Achieving Balance of
   Interests in Tax Relations: Theory and Law Enforcement in Russia and
   abroad},
Journal = {PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {82-105},
Abstract = {One of the problems of Russian tax science that we have to face in
   practice is the lack of clear legal mechanisms and forms of coordination
   of antinomic interests.The ``balance of interests{''} construct is used
   as often as it is unintelligent in legal literature and judicial acts.
   Many questions remain unanswered: what exactly is the balance of
   interests and what are its criteria, how it is achieved, what tools and
   algorithms exist for this.The balancing itself is almost always
   implicit.Both in the theory of tax law and in practice, it is something
   new (terra incognita).Due to a lack of understanding of the essence of
   the balance and how to achieve it, in the absence of a developed
   methodology for assessing and weighing interests, tax hard cases are
   resolved more intuitively, based on the law enforcement officer's own
   ideas about what is due. This approach does not add legitimacy and
   openness to judicial acts, and often causes misunderstandings in the
   professional law community.The problem of subjectivism creates a real
   threat of infringement of the legitimate interests not only of the
   parties to tax relations, but also of the rule of law in general.The
   subject of this study is the principle of proportionality, which is
   considered as a methodological basis for achieving a balance of private
   and public interests in tax relations field.The aim of the work is to
   identify possibilities of the proportionality doctrine hidden from the
   Russian law enforcement, and thereby to add rationality to the issue of
   achieving (justifying) legal balance in the resolution of tax
   conflicts.With the help of dogmatic, comparative legal and other methods
   developed by legal science, instrumental potential of principle of
   proportionality is revealed.The article considers possibility of
   receiving achievements of foreign legal thought in the domestic theory
   of tax law and adapting it to practice of tax relations. The article
   analyzes the proportionality test (the structure of criterion and the
   content) in foreign and Russian jurisdictions.Additional requirements
   for the court to substantiate the conclusions of the decision are
   identified.With the help of a mathematical model, a problem of the
   commensurability of weight of the value of interests, as well as issue
   of formalization of the process of weighing interests, is investigated;
   the concept of the weight formula promoted by Robert Alexy is critically
   evaluated.The article analyzes application of principle of
   proportionality in foreign practice and in Russia.It is concluded
   principle mentioned is the legal embodiment of the Pareto-optimum
   principle.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the first decadal reanalysis simulation of the
   biogeochemistry of the North West European shelf, along with a full
   evaluation of its skill, confidence, and value. An error-characterized
   satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a
   physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a
   localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis
   improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the
   study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had
   skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10
   ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and
   higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity,
   and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate,
   nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for
   partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The
   reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but
   not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing
   environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case
   studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf
   bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially
   threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed
   that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the
   total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\%

Abstract = {Statistical analysis of the daily course of exposures to TL-01 tube
   radiation for 93 psoriatic patients from the Medical University of Lodz
   during 20-day phototherapy shows that the dose of 1 J/cm(2) represents a
   unit of single exposure necessary for psoriasis healing. This value is
   converted to the antipsoriatic effective dose of 317.9 J/m(2) using the
   TL-01 lamp irradiance spectrum and the antipsoriatic action spectrum. It
   is proposed that the daily exposure of 317.9 J/m2 serves as the standard
   antipsoriatic dose (SAPD) providing a link between the cabinet and the
   out-door exposures and it could be used for planning heliotherapy in
   Poland. A model is proposed to calculate ambient antipsoriatic doses for
   3 h exposures around the local noon (9 am-12 am GMT) based on satellite
   measurements of ozone and cloud characteristics. The model constants are
   determined by a comparison with pertaining antipsoriatic doses measured
   by the Brewer spectrophotometer in central Poland. It is found that 3 h
   exposures to solar radiation in the period 15 May-15 September provides
   the mean (2005-2013) doses in the range 2.7-3.1 SAPD over Poland. Thus,
   heliotherapy could be treated as an alternative to the cabinet
   phototherapy for almost 4 months. It seems that the most effective site
   for antipsoriatic heliotherapy is the south/east part of Poland (the
   Bieszczady Mountains). The heliotherapy could be carried out in existing
   national health centers equipped with the standard easy-to-use biometers
   for on-line monitoring of UV level and controlling duration of
   sunbathing to avoid erythema risks. It is even possible to control the
   antipsoriatic heliotherapy by a patient himself, using low-cost
   hand-held instruments measuring UV index. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Modeling Crop Yield in West-African Rainfed Agriculture Using Global and

Journal = {AGRONOMY JOURNAL},

Volume = {105},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1177-1188},

Abstract = {Performance of crop yield models is generally evaluated without testing
   their ability to capture yield spatial variability across a large area.
   Local soil and environmental conditions or management factors usually
   cause significant crop yield variability. In West Africa, landscape
   heterogeneity and data scarcity pose yet additional challenges to crop
   yield modeling. In this study, conditional autoregression (CAR) and
   geographical weighted regression (GWR) were used to better understand
   spatial patterns in sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], pearl
   millet {[}Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.], and cotton (Gossypium
   hirsutum L.) yields in Burkina Faso. A series of SPOT satellite
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) 1-km(2) 10-d composite
   images spanning the crop growing season and observations of rainfall,
   topography, soil properties, and labor availability were used as
   explanatory variables in the CAR and GWR models. Regression analyses
   revealed that crop yield was significantly related to rainfall and
   topography in the semiarid and subhumid agroecological zones of Burkina
   Faso. Soil properties and labor availability mainly affected sorghum and
   millet yields in the semiarid zone. By addressing spatial dependency
   between crop yield observations in the two zones, GWR outperformed CAR
   models. For CAR models, adjusted R-2 (R-a(2)) values for the sorghum,
   millet, and cotton yields were 0.76, 0.70, and 0.50, respectively, for
   the semiarid zone and 0.54, 0.32, and 0.30, respectively, for the
   subhumid zone. For GWR models, R-a(2) values were 0.85, 0.70, 0.78,
   respectively, for the semiarid zone and 0.76, 0.67, 0.65, respectively,
   for the subhumid zone. Thus, despite limited data availability, GWR can
   be used to model the spatial variability of crop yields across large
   areas in West Africa.},

Abstract = {Better forecast of tropical cyclone (TC) can help to reduce risk and
   enhance management. The TC forecast depends on the scientific
   understanding of oceanic processes, air-sea interaction and finally, the
   atmospheric process. The TC Viyaru is taken as an example, which is
   formed at the end of 11 May 2013 and sustains up to 17 May 2013 during
   pre-monsoon season. Argo data are used to investigate ocean response
   processes by comparing pre- and post-conditions of the TC. Eight oceanic
   parameters including the sea surface temperature (SST), the sea surface
   salinity (SSS), and the barrier layer thickness (BLT), the 26 degrees C
   isotherm depth in the ocean (D-26), the isothermal layer depth (ILD),
   the mixed layer depth (MLD), the tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP)
   and the effective oceanic layer for cyclogenesis (EOLC) are chosen to
   evaluate the pre- and post-conditions of the TC along the track of
   Viyaru. The values of the SST, D-26, BLT, TCHP and EOLC in the
   pre-cyclonic condition are higher than the post-cyclonic condition,
   while the SSS, ILD and MLD in the post-cyclonic condition are higher
   than the pre-cyclonic condition of the ocean due to strong cyclonic
   winds and subsurface upwelling. It is interesting that the strong
   intensity of the TC reduces less SST and vice versa. The satisfied real
   time Argo data is not available in the northern Bay of Bengal especially
   in the coastal region. A weather research and forecasting model is
   employed to hindcast the track of Viyaru, and the satellite data from
   the National Center Environmental Prediction are used to assess the
   hindcast.},

Abstract = {Bottom trawlers land around 19 million tons of fish and invertebrates
   annually, almost one-quarter of wild marine landings. The extent of
   bottom trawling footprint (seabed area trawled at least once in a
   specified region and time period) is often contested but poorly
   described. We quantify footprints using high-resolution satellite vessel
   monitoring system (VMS) and logbook data on 24 continental shelves and
   slopes to 1,000-m depth over at least. 2 years. Trawling footprint
   varied markedly among regions: from <10\% of seabed area in Australian
   and New Zealand waters, the Aleutian Islands, East Bering Sea, South
   Chile, and Gulf of Alaska to >50\% in some European seas. Overall, 14\%
   of the 7.8 million-km(2) study area was trawled, and 86\% was not
   trawled. Trawling activity was aggregated; the most intensively trawled
   areas accounting for 90\% of activity comprised 77\% of footprint on
   average. Regional swept area ratio (SAR; ratio of total swept area
   trawled annually to total area of region, a metric of trawling
   intensity) and footprint area were related, providing an approach to
   estimate regional trawling footprints when high-resolution spatial data
   are unavailable. If SAR was <= 0.1, as in 8 of 24 regions, there was
   >95\% probability that >90\% of seabed was not trawled. If SAR was 7.9,
   equal to the highest. SAR recorded, there was >95\% probability that
   >70\% of seabed was trawled. Footprints were smaller and SAR was <= 0.25
   in regions where fishing rates consistently met international
   sustainability benchmarks for fish stocks, implying collateral
   environmental benefits from sustainable fishing.},

Abstract = {Aim To discover whether a hand-out explaining the benefits of
   intrauterine contraceptives (IUCs) and implants could increase their
   uptake in Hull, UK.
   Methods We developed a simple double-sided A4 hand-out. On one side was
   a script with pictures of copper and levonorgestrel IUCs next to a 20
   pence coin and of an implant beside a hairgrip. On the other side was
   the three-tiered effectiveness chart published in the textbook
   Contraceptive Technology. We implemented the project in family planning
   (FP), abortion and antenatal clinics and general practitioner (GP)
   surgeries. The plan was that the receptionist would give the hand-out to
   every woman and ask her to read it before seeing a clinician. We
   evaluated the hand-out in FP clinics and GP practices because routine
   electronic monitoring reports were available only for these locations.
   Results There was no impact in GP practices. There was no overall impact
   in FP clinics, with the exception of the service hub, in which there was
   an increase in the proportion of women receiving IUCs or implants of
   15.0\% between the periods October 2011-April 2012 and May 2012-November
   2012 (p=0.0002). This clinic is open 6 days per week and has permanent
   sexual health staff on the reception desk. The proportion of women
   receiving IUCs or implants returned to baseline in December
   2012-November 2013, when a change in clinic procedure to reduce waiting
   times caused staff to stop dispensing hand-outs.
   Conclusions This was not a formal study, so there was no research
   coordinator to monitor the project. We think that there was no impact
   among GPs because the project was not implemented by them. The project
   was poorly implemented at the four satellite FP clinics. Only the
   service hub implemented the project, where it had a clear impact. We
   conclude that when implemented as intended, this simple, very low-cost
   long-acting reversible contraception intervention was highly effective
   and also extremely cost effective.},

Title = {Uncertainty quantification in a heterogeneous fluvial sandstone
   reservoir using GPU-based Monte Carlo simulation},
Journal = {GEOTHERMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {114},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The efficient operation and management of a geothermal project can be
   largely affected by geological, physical, operational and economic
   uncertainties. Systematic uncertainty quantification (UQ) involving
   these parameters helps to determine the probability of the focused
   outputs, e.g., energy production, Net Present Value (NPV), etc. However,
   how to efficiently assess the specific impacts of different uncertain
   parameters on the outputs of a geothermal project is still not clear. In
   this study, we performed a comprehensive UQ to a low-enthalpy geothermal
   reservoir using the GPU implementation of the Delft Advanced Research
   Terra Simulator (DARTS) framework with stochastic Monte Carlo samplings
   of uncertain parameters. With processing the simulation results, large
   uncertainties have been found in the production temperature, pressure
   drop, produced energy and NPV. It is also clear from the analysis that
   salinity influences the producing energy and NPV via changing the amount
   of energy carried in the fluid. Our work shows that the uncertainty in
   NPV is much larger than that in produced energy, as more uncertain
   factors were encompassed in NPV evaluation. An attempt to substitute
   original 3D models with upscaled 2D models in UQ demonstrates
   significant differences in the stochastic response of these two
   approaches in representation of realistic heterogeneity. The GPU version
   of DARTS significantly improved the simulation performance, which
   guarantees the full set (10,000 times) UQ with a large model (circa 3.2
   million cells) finished within a day. With this study, the importance of
   UQ to geothermal field development is comprehensively addressed. This
   work provides a framework for assessing the impacts of uncertain
   parameters on the concerning system output of a geothermal project and
   will facilitate analyses with similar procedures.},

Abstract = {Parks perform a wide range of ecosystem services in urban environments.
   The functional importance of parks depends on the composition and
   structure of the tree stand and the specific influence on soil and
   microclimatic conditions. The article reveals the dependence of soil and
   microclimatic properties on the structure of the crown space of a park
   stand. Spectral indices were also shown to be applicable for predicting
   the spatial variability of soil and climatic properties and indicators
   of crown space. Soil properties (temperature, moisture, and electrical
   conductivity in the 5-7 cm layer) and microclimatic parameters (light
   exposure, air temperature, and atmospheric humidity) were measured in
   the park plantation using a quasi-regular grid. The canopy structure and
   gap light transmission indices were extracted from the true-colour
   fisheye photographs. Thirty species of trees and shrubs were detected in
   the stand and understory. Robinia pseudoacacia L. was found most
   frequently (24.5\% of all tree records). Acer negundo L. and A.
   platanoides L. were also frequent (12.4\% and 15.5\%, respectively). The
   first four principal components, whose eigenvalues exceeded unity, were
   extracted by the principal components analysis of the variability of
   ecological properties and vegetation indices. The principal component 1
   explained 50.5\% of the variation of the traits and positively
   correlated with the spectral vegetation indices. The principal component
   1 reflected the variability of tree cover densities due to the edaphic
   trophicity. The principal component 2 described 13\% of the variation in
   the feature space. This component correlated positively with the
   spectral indices. The principal component 2 was interpreted as a trend
   of vegetation cover variability induced by moisture variation. The
   principal component 3 described 8.6\% of trait variation. It was most
   strongly correlated with the atmospheric humidity. An increase in
   atmospheric humidity was associated with an increase in the soil
   moisture and electrical conductivity and a decrease in the soil and
   atmospheric temperature. The principal component 4 described 7.5 \% of
   the variation of traits. An increase in the values of principal
   component 4 was associated with an increase in the soil moisture and
   electrical conductivity and atmospheric moisture and was associated with
   a decrease in the soil and atmospheric temperature. The combinations of
   the trophotope and hygrotope create the optimal conditions for specific
   tree species, which is a condition for achieving the maximization of
   ecosystem services. The mineral nutrition conditions of plants and soil
   moisture exhibit spatial patterns that allow them to be considered in
   the design and management of park plantations. The ecological indices
   measured in the field were shown to be predicted using the vegetation
   indices. Multiple regression models were able to explain 11-61\% of
   indicator variation. The regression relationships between markers of
   soil and microclimatic conditions and vegetation predictors are
   important for monitoring the condition of park plantations and
   evaluating the performance of park plantation management tools.},

Abstract = {We developed DeepSolar, a deep learning framework analyzing satellite
   imagery to identify the GPS locations and sizes of solar photovoltaic
   panels. Leveraging its high accuracy and scalability, we constructed a
   comprehensive high-fidelity solar deployment database for the contiguous
   US. We demonstrated its value by discovering that residential solar
   deployment density peaks at a population density of 1,000 capita/mile 2,
   increases with annual household income asymptoting at similar to\$150k,
   and has an inverse correlation with the Gini index representing income
   inequality. We uncovered a solar radiation threshold (4.5 kWh/m(2)/day)
   above which the solar deployment is ``triggered.'' Furthermore, we built
   an accurate machine learning-based predictive model to estimate the
   solar deployment density at the census tract level. We offer the
   DeepSolar database as a publicly available resource for researchers,
   utilities, solar developers, and policymakers to further uncover solar
   deployment patterns, build comprehensive economic and behavioral models,
   and ultimately support the adoption and management of solar electricity.},

Abstract = {The satellite imagery data naturally exists as raster data. Useful
   information that can empower the domain experts to improve their
   decision-making abilities lies hidden in this data. However, finding
   this hidden knowledge is non-trivial and challenging due to the lack of
   open source integrated software to discover knowledge from raster data.
   In particular, existing open-source general-purpose data mining
   libraries, such as Knime {[}1], Mahout {[}3], Weka {[}5], Sci-kit {[}4],
   and SPMF {[}2], are inadequate to find knowledge hidden in raster
   datasets.
   In this talk, we present rasterMiner an integrated open-source software
   to discover knowledge from raster imagery datasets. It currently
   provides unsupervised learning techniques, such as pattern mining and
   clustering, to discover knowledge hidden in raster data. The key
   features of our software are as follows: (i) provides four pattern
   mining algorithms and four clustering algorithms to discover knowledge
   from raster data, (ii) Our software also provides ``elbow method{''} to
   choose an appropriate k value for k-mean and k-means++ algorithms, (iii)
   Our software presents an integrated GUI that can facilitate the domain
   experts to choose algorithm(s) of their choice, (iv) Our software can
   also be accessed as a python-library, (v) The knowledge discovered by
   our software can be stored in standard formats so that the generated
   knowledge can be visualized using any GIS software.},

Title = {Embrace through the universe: Sound design with cosmic muons and the

Abstract = {Although humans are destined to live in a world of chaos, there is also
   hidden beauty within it. Analogically, this implies that there can be a
   creative way of living through the exploration of the unknown.
   Considering humans are part of the dynamism of the whole universe that
   consists of matter and energy, what would it be like if they could feel
   being embraced through the universe? Having continuous dialogues with
   the organizer throughout the planning phase, an artistic performance
   with the sounds of the universe is presented at the cultural event
   Connected Ink 2021 in Tokyo. This performance is entitled Life, the
   Universe and Everything in homage to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy by Douglas Adams. In this paper, the background, concepts,
   physics, sound design, and the process and result of the project are
   discussed in collaboration with artists, sound designers, and
   experimental physicists. Regarding the sound design, it had been
   developed, in part, based on what the authors have shown through the
   preliminary sound the installation: Particle Post - Letters from the
   Universe in 2019, through which the signals from cosmic muons that are
   captured by a scintillation detector are poetically designed.
   Transforming imperceivable elements of the universe into an appreciable
   form in a poetic manner is one of the crucial essences of the authors'
   research and practice. With this, we believe that we could approach the
   wonders of the universe aesthetically. Hence, imperceivable elements
   such as cosmic muons and the parameters of solar wind (density, speed,
   and temperature in particular) captured from the satellite DSCOVR
   orbiting the L1 Lagrange point, are brought into the audio system in
   almost real time. Five iron fuurin, Japanese wind bells, ring triggered
   by cosmic muons that constantly arrive on Earth, while the stylized
   sounds of solar wind surround the large space at the venue.
   Consequently, these two different kinds of `wind' sounds create harmony
   within the space, hoping to create a similar harmony through the bodies
   and minds of the audience as well. This project also signifies the value
   of genuine dialogue and communication with the purpose of deepening an
   interdisciplinary collaboration and opening up further creation.},

Abstract = {Japan has traditionally emphasized international student recruitment and
   exchange as priorities in its internationalization strategy. However,
   little attention has been given to the increasing importance of
   international program and provider mobility (IPPM), which includes
   international branch campuses, franchise programs, international joint
   universities and joint/double degree programs. This article analyzes the
   policies, status and role of IPPM to meet future needs of Japanese
   higher education. The study reveals that the full potential of IPPM is
   not realized given the government's restrictive regulations for the
   establishment of Japanese programs and international branch campuses
   abroad as well as foreign higher education providers in Japan. While
   regulations are necessary to ensure quality and achieve the multiple
   benefits of IPPM provision, there is a need to re-examine and relax some
   of the government regulations that serve as barriers. The success of the
   three Japanese international joint universities provides evidence that
   Japanese universities are motivated and experienced in working
   collaboratively with international partners and looking for new IPPM
   opportunities. Scholars, policy analysts, and academics interested in
   Japan's engagement with the rest of the world through collaborating with
   foreign higher education partners will benefit from this analysis of
   current and past IPPM activities and policies and the call for further
   research.},

Abstract = {In agriculture, soil and crop conditions change from day to day and
   throughout the growing season. Agricultural targets also vary spatially
   with differences observed from field to field, as well as within
   individual fields. The heterogeneity of corn-growing conditions in
   Mexico makes accurate data for crop type, crop condition and crop yield
   prediction difficult to obtain. Yield predictions are needed by the
   federal government to estimate, ahead of harvest time, the amount of
   corn required to be imported in order to meet the expected domestic
   shortfall. In this project a methodology for the estimation of corn
   yield ahead of harvest time is developed which uses radar and optical
   remote sensing and which specifically considers the corn-growing
   situation in Central Mexico. Radar based crop type classification
   requires data sets with multiple polarizations. Recent research to
   assess relative classification accuracies of multi-polarized
   combinations for target crops using airborne data has been reported. In
   addition to identifying crop type and variety, identifying crop growth
   stage is valuable. Crop condition, loosely defined as the vigor or
   health of a crop in a particular growth stage, is related to crop
   productivity and yield; however, the relationship is complex. Main crop
   condition indicators include biomass, height, leaf area and contents (if
   plant water, chlorophyll and nitrogen. Crop-type and crop-condition
   mapping are among the applications that are expected to benefit the most
   from the technical enhancements embodied by RADARSAT-2. The potential of
   RADARSAT-1 data for these applications has been rated as ``limited{''},
   whereas for RADARSAT-2 data this potential is anticipated to be
   ``strong{''}. The Science and Operational Applications Research for
   RADARSAT-2 Program (SOAR) is promoting the evaluation of Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities by providing images to selected
   research projects which include the present one.
   The objectives of this project are: a) use RADARSAT-2 data and optical
   data to determine cultivated areas and monitor crop condition for
   obtaining better estimations of crop yield; b) obtain polarization
   signatures from RADARSAT-2 data for corn and relate these to Leaf Area
   Index and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) crop parameters and
   vegetation indexes, to establish indicators of crop condition and
   produce estimates for crop yield; c) use field data collected for three
   key corn crop growth stages over 300 pilot plots during 2001-2006, and
   increase the number of plots to build a database to support accuracy
   studies using RADARSAT-2 data.
   The expected benefits of this project are: to obtain knowledge about
   crop type, crop condition and crop yield with better accuracy than with
   current methodologies; to support national corn farmers associations; to
   design agriculture related activities within State agriculture plans; to
   support the corn product industry and aid government decision making.
   Relevant results and economical impact will imply operational usage of
   RADARSAT- 2 data in the agricultural sector in Mexico.},

Abstract = {Generating land capability class guidelines at a watershed scale has
   become a priority in sustainable agricultural land use. This study
   analyzed the area of cultivated land use situated on the non-arable
   land-capability class in the Jema watershed in the Upper Blue Nile River
   Basin. Soil surveys, meteorological ground observations, a digital
   elevation model (DEM) at 30 m, Meteosat at 10 km x 10 km and Landsat at
   30 m were used to generate the sample soil texture class, average annual
   total rainfall (ATRF in mm), terrain, slope (\%), elevation (m a.s.l)
   and land-use land cover (\%). The land capability class was analyzed by
   considering raster layers of terrain, the average ATRF and soil texture.
   Geo-statistics was employed to fit a surface of soil texture and average
   ATRF estimates. An overlay technique was used to compute the proportion
   of cultivated land placed on non-arable land. As per the results of the
   terrain analysis, the elevation (m a.s.l) of the watershed is in the
   range of 1895 to 3518 m. The slope was found to be in the range of 0 to
   45\%. The amount of estimated rainfall ranged from 1640 to 131 mm with
   value declined from the lower to the higher elevation. Clay loam, clay
   and heavy clay were found to be the major soil texture classes. Four
   land capability classes, i.e., II, III, IV (arable) and V (non-arable),
   were identified with proportions of 28.56\%, 45.74\%, 22.16\% and
   3.54\%, respectively. Seven land-use land covers were identified, i.e.,
   annual crop land, grazing land, bush land, bare land, settlement land,
   forestland and water bodies, with proportions of 42.1, 35.9, 8.90, 8.3,
   2.6, 2.1, and 0.2, respectively. Around 1707.7 ha of land in the
   watershed is categorized under non-arable land that cannot be used for
   annual crop cultivation at any level of intensity. Around 437 ha (3.5\%)
   of land was cultivated on non-arable land. To conclude, the observed
   unsustainable crop land use could maximize soil loss in upstream regions
   and siltation and flooding downstream. The annual crop land use that was
   observed on non-arable land needs to be replaced with perennial crops,
   pasture and/or forest land uses.},

Booktitle = {SHORT STAY MANAGEMENT OF CHEST PAIN},

Pages = {91-113},
Abstract = {Use of cardiac biomarkers for care of patients presenting to the
   emergency department has a rich history beginning in the 1950s.
   Aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, creatine
   kinase and its MB isoenzyme and myoglobin have all been utilized over
   the years. However a sentinel event occurred in the 1990s with the
   availability of assays for the myocardial specific biomarkers cardiac
   troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Along with clinical
   features and the electrocardiogram, cTnI and cTnT measurements are now a
   cornerstone for early risk stratification, the diagnosis of myocardial
   infarction and clinical decision-making in the context of suspected
   acute coronary syndrome patients in the emergency department.
   Point-of-care measurements of cardiac troponin and other markers have
   been implemented at many institutions where the central laboratory is
   unable to provide results in one hour or less from the time of
   collection. Because cTnT and cTnI are believed to be released only upon
   myocardial necrosis, there has been substantial effort in identifying
   markers of myocardial ischemia that do not necessarily have irreversible
   cell death. Promising markers include ischemia modified albumin,
   C-reactive protein, myloperoxidase as well as B-type natriuretic peptide
   and its biologically inactive co-metabolite NT-proBNP. Also, attention
   has turned to measurement of very low troponin concentrations measured
   using assays that are able to measure troponin reliably at
   concentrations 10- to 100-fold lower than the best conventional troponin
   assays, with the idea of specifically detecting subtle cardiac injury
   associated with unstable angina. There are a number of clinical
   confounders for measurements including renal insufficiency, end stage
   renal disease, blunt chest trauma, pulmonary embolism, chemotherapy and
   recent cardiac procedures. Interpretation of cardiac marker results in
   these clinical circumstances can be complicated and the clinical course
   of the patient relative to temporal increase in biomarkers must be taken
   into account.
   Few tests have the clinical value and impact of cTnT and cTnI, and it is
   unlikely that these tests will be replaced for the diagnosis of MI in
   the foreseeable future. For risk stratification and patient management,
   however., other markers of inflammation, heart dysfunction or the
   coagulation process may provide complementary information. Some of these
   novel markers may come from the proteomic, metabolomic and molecular
   diagnostic studies. However, it is critical to note that the real value
   of any new or existing markers will hinge on evidence that their
   utilization can be shown to improve clinical and/or economic outcomes.},

Title = {Ecosystem services from rainwater harvesting in India},
Journal = {URBAN WATER JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Pages = {561-573},
Abstract = {Availability of a safe and reliable water supply is an issue in
   developing nations, including India. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a
   site-specific source control used to satisfy human, agricultural, and
   safety demands for water. This study analyzed the effects of capturing
   rainwater for a 12.5 year period (Jan 1999-Jun 2011) to provide three
   ecosystem services: water supplementation for indoor use, water
   supplementation for food production and groundwater recharge (GWR). A
   hydrologic analysis was completed using satellite rainfall data and a
   water balance approach. Two demand scenarios, indoor and outdoor, were
   considered, with water in excess of demand and storage directed to
   recharge groundwater. An economic analysis quantified RWH system net
   present value. The results indicated significant ecosystem services
   benefits were possible from RWH in India. RWH for the purpose of
   providing irrigation to a small garden and allowing overflow to a
   drywell for GWR was concluded to be an approach to maximize benefits.
   This scenario provided the greatest net present value (21,764-38,851
   INR), fastest payback period (0.30-0.98 years), and recharge to
   groundwater of more than 40\% of onsite rainfall. The benefit of the
   outdoor vegetable irrigation was determined and the results showed that
   the caloric demands of the typical Indian household (2.75kg of tomatoes
   and 1.05kg of lettuce) could be met with a 20m(2) garden, and excess
   food could be sold to offset the capital cost of the system and later
   for economic gain.},

Title = {Mortality burden attributable to long-term ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>
   exposure in China: using novel exposure-response functions with multiple
   exposure windows},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {246},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Background: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
   increases the mortality burden. Exposure windows and exposure-response
   functions (ERFs) are two critical components of accurate mortality
   burden estimation.
   Objective: We explored the potential heterogeneity of exposure windows
   and reassessed the PM2.5-attributable mortality burden in China with
   novel ERFs.
   Method: Based on 1 km x 1 km satellite-retrieved PM2.5 and population
   data, provincial-level age structure, and mortality data, we applied the
   recent Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) with multiple exposure
   windows (1-year to 6-year during 2010-2015) to estimate age-specific
   PM2.5-attributable mortality burden in China in 2015. Then, the Global
   Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Integrated Exposure-Response (IER) and
   Log-Linear (LL) models were exercised for comparative analysis.
   Result: The PM2.5-attributable mortality was the highest with a 3-year
   average exposure window (2013-2015). The GEMM-based total premature
   deaths were 133.2\% {[}95\% confidence interval (95\% CI):
   93.6\%-226.4\%] and 14.2\% (95\% CI: 13.9\%-16.8\%) higher than the
   values obtained from the GBD2017 IER model and LL model, respectively.
   The national mortality burden attributable to PM2.5 was 1.94 (95\% CI:
   1.63-2.23) million, of which IHD and stroke were the leading causes,
   accounting for 27.3\% and 23.0\% of the total burden respectively. The
   mortality burden for the people over 80 years old was 0.62 (95\%CI:
   0.52-0.71) million, accounting for 31.9\% (95\%CI: 31.8\%-32.0\%) of the
   total burden.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential heterogeneity of
   PM2.5-attributable mortality burden associated with different exposure
   windows, especially when there are spatial-temporal variations in PM2.5
   concentrations. The model comparison results suggest that the health
   impacts attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure in China may be much
   higher than previously estimated. The population over 80 years old has
   the highest PM2.5-attributable mortality burden. These findings have
   important policy implications for addressing air pollution at the
   provincial and national level in China.},

Title = {DO PARKING FEES AFFECT COMMUTING CHOICES OF STAFF AND STUDENTS ON A
   UNIVERSITY CAMPUS?},
Booktitle = {TRANSPORT AND THE CITY},
Year = {2018},
Pages = {191-203},
Abstract = {Many initiatives have been implemented in an attempt to reduce traffic
   congestion and to encourage more sustainable commuting choices, however,
   rarely has before-after research been undertaken to measure the effect
   of introduction of such initiatives on commuter attitudes or behaviour.
   The University of Waikato, New Zealand, introduced parking charges for
   approximately 14,000 staff and students on their main campus in 2016,
   but not on a satellite campus in another city. A multi-method approach
   including questionnaires, naturalistic observation and photo-voice
   methodologies was used to assess the impact of parking fees on commuting
   attitudes and behaviour of staff and students. The heavy reliance on car
   travel was undiminished after the introduction of parking fees.
   Commuters still arrived by car, but more parked off-campus or became
   willing to pay parking fees after they were introduced. There was no
   increase in bus travel or cycling after the introduction of parking
   fees. Strategies to decrease car commuting to university campuses
   include higher parking charges, removing any ability to pay in advance
   for parking, reducing the availability of free parking nearby,
   subsidizing bus travel for staff and students, improving cycle and
   pedestrian access and related facilities, promoting the health benefits
   of active transport, policies that encourage students to spend more time
   on campus, ensuring that bus schedules align with lecture times and
   provision of student housing on or near campus.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal type of
   stroke worldwide. Herein, we aim to develop a predictive model based on
   computed tomography (CT) markers in an ICH cohort and validate it in
   another cohort. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study
   was conducted in 3 medical centers in China. The values of CT markers,
   including hypodensities, hematoma density, blend sign, black hole sign,
   island sign, midline shift, baseline hematoma volume, and satellite
   sign, in predicting poor outcome were analyzed by logistic regression
   analysis. A nomogram was developed based on the results of multivariate
   logistic regression analysis in development cohort. Area under curve
   (AUC) and calibration plot were used to assess the accuracy of nomogram
   in this development cohort and validate in another cohort. Results: A
   total of 1,498 patients were included in this study. Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis indicated that hypodensities, black hole
   sign, island sign, midline shift, and baseline hematoma volume were
   independently associated with poor outcome in development cohort. The
   AUC was 0.75 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.73-0.76) in the
   internal validation with development cohort and 0.74 (95\% CI:
   0.72-0.75) in the external validation with validation cohort. The
   calibration plot in development and validation cohort indicated that the
   nomogram was well calibrated. Conclusions: CT markers of hypodensities,
   black hole sign, and island sign might predict poor outcome of ICH
   patients within 90 days.},

Title = {Considerations for Sex-Cognizant Research in Exercise Biology and
   Medicine},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {As the fields of kinesiology, exercise science, and human movement
   developed, the majority of the research focused on male physiology and
   extrapolated findings to females. In the medical sphere, basing practice
   on data developed in only males resulted in the removal of drugs from
   the market in the late 1990s due to severe side effects (some
   life-threatening) in females that were not observed in males. In
   response to substantial evidence demonstrating exercise-induced health
   benefits, exercise is often promoted as a key modality in disease
   prevention, management, and rehabilitation. However, much like the early
   days of drug development, a historical literature knowledge base of
   predominantly male studies may leave the exercise field vulnerable to
   overlooking potentially key biological differences in males and females
   that may be important to consider in prescribing exercise (e.g., how
   exercise responses may differ between sexes and whether there are
   optimal approaches to consider for females that differ from conventional
   approaches that are based on male physiology). Thus, this review will
   discuss anatomical, physiological, and skeletal muscle molecular
   differences that may contribute to sex differences in exercise
   responses, as well as clinical considerations based on this knowledge in
   athletic and general populations over the continuum of age. Finally,
   this review summarizes the current gaps in knowledge, highlights the
   areas ripe for future research, and considerations for sex-cognizant
   research in exercise fields.},

Title = {Assessment of skin response in T4b breast carcinoma patients
   post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy},
Journal = {ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Background: Breast cancer patients with skin ulcerations, satellite
   nodules or Peau d'orange at presentation are classified with stage 4
   breast cancer (T4b). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), followed by
   mastectomy, is the commonly accepted treatment in such patients for fear
   of adverse outcomes with breast conservation surgery (BCS) and
   uncertainty over sparing initially involved skin irrespective of the
   response to chemotherapy. Identifying patients with skin resolution
   post-NACT can help surgeons in decision-making.
   Aim: To assess skin response in T4b breast cancer patients post-NACT and
   find the correlation between various clinical and pathological factors
   associated with no skin involvement on final histology.
   Methodology: Records of breast cancer patients managed at the Tata
   Medical Center, Kolkata, with NACT for T4b breast carcinoma patients who
   underwent mastectomy were reviewed between January 2014 and December
   2018. Final histology was checked for dermal involvement with the
   tumour. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables for
   descriptive data, and Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact tests
   were applied for categorical data. p-value < 0.05 was taken as
   significant.
   Results: A total of 285 records mentioning skin involvement were
   reviewed, out of which 111 patients fulfilled the AJCC criterion. The
   median age at diagnosis of T4b breast cancer was 50 years. The median
   clinical size pre-chemotherapy was 7 cm. Residual median tumour size on
   final histology was reported as 1 cm. 78/111 patients showed a postNACT
   response of 50\% or more, and 43/111 showed a response of more than
   90\%. 57 (51.4\%) patients showed skin involvement on final
   histopathology, while 54 (48.6\%) patients did not. ER negative tumours
   were more likely to show no dermal involvement (p = 0.006). Residual
   tumour size of less than 1 cm on final histology (p < 0.05) and nodal
   stage were significant predictors of dermal response.
   Conclusion: Approximately half of the T4b breast cancer patients showed
   resolution of dermal skin involvement post-NACT. ER negative and those
   with residual tumour size less than 1 cm post-NACT are more likely to
   show dermal resolution. This can help surgeons plan a BCS or skin
   sparing mastectomy for such patients who usually end up having a
   mastectomy.},

Title = {Climate-Change Sensitive Residential Areas and Their Adaptation
   Capacities by Urban Green Changes: Case Study of Linz, Austria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As summer air temperatures continue to increase, urban areas will be
   most affected since urban building structures and materials intensify
   the heat island effect. The number of people who will be affected by
   increasing temperatures will rise, especially those in the
   heat-sensitive group of elderly people. Urban planning departments have
   to develop adaptation strategies in order to limit negative effects of
   climate change on their citizens. Due to their climatic ecosystem
   services, urban green areas can play an important role in this process.
   Since the effects of climate change can vary in different urban areas, a
   study was conducted focusing on identification of residential areas most
   affected by climate change according to surface cover structure and
   demographic characteristics in the City of Linz, Austria by using
   satellite images and demographic data. Residential areas with low
   vegetation cover and a high number of risk group members are identified
   as ``climate-change sensitive residential areas (CCSRA).{''} About half
   of the residential areas of Linz and nearly two thirds of the population
   of Linz live in these areas. With selected representatives of these
   CCSRAs, the greening potential was identified and climate adaptive
   strategies developed. A survey carried out in selected CCSRAs showed a
   high appreciation for urban green areas (83.3 to 86.7 percent) by the
   inhabitants but a very low trust (35.0 to 56.7 percent) in their ability
   to contribute to the reduction of thermal load. Most residents would
   support an increase of different types of urban greenery in their
   residential areas (e.g., 76.7 to 91.7 percent would support an increase
   in lawns); at the same time, there is a high rejection of unsealing
   measures (e.g., 38.9 to 57.5 percent reject a lower number of parking
   lots). Greening measures, which would not require a change of surface
   structures such as facade greening, are the least accepted greening
   measures (38.9 to 57.5 percent reject this possibility). In the opinion
   of most inhabitants, residents should decide on the green structure of
   their residential areas (69.4 and 76.7 percent), while only a minority
   would approve of the involvement of urban planners (40.0 to 43.3
   percent) or experts and scientists (16.7 to 30.0 percent) in this
   process. The results show an informational and educational deficit on
   the subject of climate change impact at a local level. The greening
   potential in CCSRAs is still not sufficiently valued by decision-makers
   and inhabitants, and adaptation strategies in the urban development of
   the areas are lacking. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Estimating Rainfall Intensity Using an Image-Based Deep Learning Model},
Journal = {ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {162-174},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urban flooding is a major issue worldwide, causing huge economic losses
   and serious threats to public safety. One promising way to mitigate its
   impacts is to develop a real-time flood risk management system; however,
   building such a system is often challenging due to the lack of high
   spatiotemporal rainfall data. While some approaches (i.e., ground
   rainfall stations or radar and satellite techniques) are available to
   measure and/or predict rainfall intensity, it is difficult to obtain
   accurate rainfall data with a desirable spatiotemporal resolution using
   these methods. This paper proposes an image-based deep learning model to
   estimate urban rainfall intensity with high spatial and temporal
   resolution. More specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   model called the image-based rainfall CNN (irCNN) model is developed
   using rainfall images collected from existing dense sensors (i.e., smart
   phones or transportation cameras) and their corresponding measured
   rainfall intensity values. The trained irCNN model is subsequently
   employed to efficiently estimate rainfall intensity based on the
   sensors' rainfall images. Synthetic rainfall data and real rainfall
   images are respectively utilized to explore the irCNN's accuracy in
   theoretically and practically simulating rainfall intensity. The results
   show that the irCNN model provides rainfall estimates with a mean
   absolute percentage error ranging between 13.5\% and 21.9\%, which
   exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art modeling techniques in
   the literature. More importantly, the main feature of the proposed irCNN
   is its low cost in efficiently acquiring high spatiotemporal urban
   rainfall data. The irCNN model provides a promising alternative for
   estimating urban rainfall intensity, which can greatly facilitate the
   development of urban flood risk management in a real-time manner. (c)

Title = {Dataset on the global distribution of shallow groundwater},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Shallow groundwater (GW), defined as the water table of unconfined or
   perched aquifers that is near enough to the land surface to influence
   the vadose zone and the surface soil moisture, impacts land surface
   water, energy, and car -bon cycles by providing additional moisture to
   the root zone via capillary fluxes. Although the interactions of shallow
   GW and the terrestrial land surface are widely recognized,
   in-corporating shallow GW into the land surface, climate, and
   agroecosystem models is not yet possible due to the lack of groundwater
   data. Groundwater systems are affected by var-ious factors, including
   climate, land use/land cover, ecosys-tems, GW extractions, and
   lithology. Although GW wells are the most direct and accurate way of
   monitoring water table depths at point scales, upscaling GW levels from
   point scale to areal or regional scale poses significant challenges.
   Here, we provide high spatiotemporal resolution global maps of the
   terrestrial land surface areas influenced by shallow GW from mid-2015 to
   2021 (a separate NetCDF file for each year) in a 9 km spatial and daily
   temporal resolution. We derived this data from NASA's Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) mission spaceborne soil moisture observations with
   a temporal resolution of 3 days and approximately 9 km grid resolution.
   This spatial scale corresponds to SMAP's ``Equal Area Scalable Earth ``
   (EASE) grids. The central assumption is that the monthly moving average
   of soil moisture observa-tions and their coefficient of variation are
   sensitive to shal-low GW regardless of the prevailing climate. We
   process the Level-2 enhanced passive soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP\_E)
   product to detect shallow GW signals. The presence of shal-low GW data
   is calculated by an ensemble machine learn-ing model, which is trained
   using simulations from a variably saturated soil moisture flow model
   (Hydrus-1D). The simula-tions span various climates, soil textures, and
   lower bound-ary conditions.The spatiotemporal distribution of shallow GW
   data based on SMAP soil moisture observations is provided for the first
   time with this dataset. The data are of value in a wide variety of
   applications. The most direct use is in climate and land sur-face models
   as lower boundary conditions or as a diagnostic tool to verify model
   results. Some other applications may in-clude flood risk analyses and
   regulation, identifying geotech-nical issues such as shallow
   GW-triggered liquefaction, global food security, ecosystem services,
   watershed management, crop yield, vegetation health, water storage
   trends, and track-ing mosquito-borne diseases by identifying wetlands,
   among other applications.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Impact of Competition Versus Centralisation of Hospital Care on Process
   Quality: A Multilevel Analysis of Breast Cancer Surgery in France},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {459-469},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: The implications of competition among hospitals on care
   quality have been the subject of considerable debate. On one hand,
   economic theory suggests that when prices are regulated, quality will be
   increased in competitive markets. On the other hand, hospital mergers
   have been justified by the need to exploit cost advantages, and by
   evidence that hospital volume and care quality are related. Methods:
   Based on patient-level data from two years (2005 and 2012) we track
   changes in market competition and treatment patterns in breast cancer
   surgery. We focus on technology adoption as a proxy of process quality
   and examine the likelihood of offering two innovative surgical
   procedures: immediate breast reconstruction (IBR), after mastectomy and
   sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We use an index of competition based
   on a multinomial logit model of hospital choice which is not subject to
   endogeneity bias, and estimate its impact on the propensity to receive
   IBR and SLNB by means of multilevel models taking into account both
   observable patient and hospital characteristics. Results: The likelihood
   of receiving these procedures is significantly higher in hospitals
   located in more competitive markets. Yet, hospital volume remains a
   significant indicator of quality, therefore benefits of competition
   appear to be sensitive to the estimates of the impact of volume on care
   process. In France, the centralisation policy, with minimum activity
   thresholds, have contributed to improving breast cancer treatment
   between 2005 and 2012. Conclusion: Finding the right balance between
   costs and benefits of market competition versus concentration of
   hospital care supply is complex. We find that close to monopolistic
   markets do not encourage innovation and quality in cancer treatment, but
   highly competitive markets where many hospitals have very low activity
   volumes are also problematic because hospital quality is positively
   linked to patient volume.},

   and `Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated
   through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation
   analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing
   comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best
   integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of
   0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like

   36\% area are classified under `Very High' to `Severe' structural risk

   Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in
   the `Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein
   near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and
   microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified
   debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface
   conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure
   analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value
   that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is
   seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the `Low to Moderate' landslide
   susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the `High'
   landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the `Very High
   to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both
   gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability
   analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2)
   and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these
   parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison
   demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the `High to Severe'

Title = {Torrential Hazard Prevention in Alpine Small Basin through Historical,
   Empirical and Geomorphological Cross Analysis in NW Italy},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Debris flow is one of the most dangerous natural processes in mountain
   regions and it occur in a wide variety of environments throughout the
   world. In the Italian Alps, some tens of thousands of damaging debris
   flow and, in general, torrential floods associated to intense sediment
   transport in secondary catchments have been documented in the last 300
   years. These have caused socio-economic damage, damage to anthropogenic
   structures or infrastructures and in many cases casualties. Often, in
   the same basins, the occurrence of debris-flow processes recurs many
   years later. Prediction can often be spatial and based on the magnitude
   of the largest known process, while the temporal forecast is the most
   uncertain. It is also possible to increase the resilience of the
   population and of the territory. The present study aims at investigating
   different levels of debris-flow hazard in urban areas on Alpine alluvial
   fans and proposes a strategy for debris-flow prevention based on
   historical research and on a simplified analytical approach, methods
   that also involve relatively low costs. For such analysis, Ischiator
   stream catchment (ca. 20 km(2)) and its alluvial fan (NW Italy) were
   selected. This area was partly affected by historical torrential flood
   associated to intense sediment transport and debris-flow processes.
   Present-day instability conditions along the slope and the stream
   network were detected and synthesized through surveys and aerial photo
   interpretation integrated by satellite images (period 1954-2021). An
   estimation of the potential amount of moving detritus, referred to as
   debris flow, was carried out regarding the June 1957 debris-flow event,
   based on the predictive models. The individual hazard index value was
   estimated based on different methods. The results indicate that 56\% of
   the area is exposed to flood associated to intense sediment transport
   hazard, which fluctuates from high to very high levels; such results are
   supported by debris-flow historical records. Since today almost half of
   the settlement (Bagni di Vinadio) is located on potentially risk-exposed
   areas, the urban evolution policy adopted after the 1957 event failed to
   manage the risk connection to debris-flow activity.},

Title = {Reshaping Publicness: Research on Correlation between Public
   Participation and Spatial Form in Urban Space Based on Space Syntax-A
   Case Study on Nanjing Xinjiekou},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on urban regeneration practices in central urban
   areas, aiming to find key points for reshaping the publicness of urban
   spaces by exploring the morphological features of public spaces and the
   spatial distribution patterns of public activities. Now that China's
   urbanization process has stabilized, large-scale regeneration is no
   longer applicable to the current urban environment, and urban morphology
   has proved to be significantly useful in understanding and designing the
   built environment. However, current research lacks quantitative studies
   on morphology and public activities, and thus is hardly instructive for
   the cognition and design of spatial morphology in specific locations.
   Therefore, this paper attempts to subdivide spatial morphology at the
   level of ``micro-renewal{''} or ``micro-renovation{''} in order to
   explore the impact of spatial morphology on public participation in
   cities. The site chosen for this study is Xinjiekou in Nanjing. As a key
   area of two important arteries in the center of Nanjing, Xinjiekou has
   been a gathering place for a variety of commercial forms, such as
   finance, retail department stores, restaurants, and entertainment, and
   has been the commercial and financial center of Nanjing since the 1940s.
   In an on-site observation of urban development and pedestrian flow in
   the Xinjiekou area, the study found that despite its status as the area
   with the highest degree of spatial accessibility and public
   participation, its public space has gradually lost its attractiveness to
   residents, who lack a sense of participation and place identity. Based
   on the study of urban public spaces, both accessibility and choice play
   an important role in increasing public participation. Therefore, this
   study combined observation and quantitative analysis of Space Syntax to
   obtain the distribution of accessibility, choice, and public activity.
   Based on the results of the analysis, this research uses GWR as the
   statistical method to clarify the correlation between different
   variables. The final conclusion is that when the space type is a path
   with high choice value and the paths are connected, the enhancement of
   accessibility and choice plays an important role in promoting public
   participation. This statistically based empirical study of testable
   correlations is very helpful for the perception of location-specific
   spaces with high levels of interpretability and confidence. Thus, it
   further guides the design and has a high reference value for future
   spatial planning.},

Title = {Landslide Susceptibility Assessment of a Part of the Western Ghats
   (India) Employing the AHP and F-AHP Models and Comparison with Existing
   Susceptibility Maps},

Abstract = {Landslides are prevalent in the Western Ghats, and the incidences that
   happened in 2021 in the Koottickal area of the Kottayam district
   (Western Ghats) resulted in the loss of 10 lives. The objectives of this
   study are to assess the landslide susceptibility of the high-range local
   self-governments (LSGs) in the Kottayam district using the analytical
   hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP (F-AHP) models and to compare the
   performance of existing landslide susceptible maps. This area never
   witnessed any massive landslides of this dimension, which warrants the
   necessity of relooking into the existing landslide-susceptible models.
   For AHP and F-AHP modeling, ten conditioning factors were selected:
   slope, soil texture, land use/land cover (LULC), geomorphology, road
   buffer, lithology, and satellite image-derived indices such as the
   normalized difference road landslide index (NDRLI), the normalized
   difference water index (NDWI), the normalized burn ratio (NBR), and the
   soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The landslide-susceptible zones
   were categorized into three: low, moderate, and high. The validation of
   the maps created using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   technique ascertained the performances of the AHP, F-AHP, and TISSA maps
   as excellent, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value above 0.80,
   and the NCESS map as acceptable, with an AUC value above 0.70. Though
   the difference is negligible, the map prepared using the TISSA model has
   better performance (AUC = 0.889) than the F-AHP (AUC = 0.872), AHP (AUC
   = 0.867), and NCESS (AUC = 0.789) models. The validation of maps
   employing other matrices such as accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE),
   and root mean square error (RMSE) also confirmed that the TISSA model
   (0.869, 0.226, and 0.122, respectively) has better performance, followed
   by the F-AHP (0.856, 0.243, and 0.147, respectively), AHP (0.855, 0.249,
   and 0.159, respectively), and NCESS (0.770, 0.309, and 0.177,
   respectively) models. The most landslide-inducing factors in this area
   that were identified through this study are slope, soil texture, LULC,
   geomorphology, and NDRLI. Koottickal, Poonjar-Thekkekara, Moonnilavu,
   Thalanad, and Koruthodu are the LSGs that are highly susceptible to
   landslides. The identification of landslide-susceptible areas using
   diversified techniques will aid decision-makers in identifying critical
   infrastructure at risk and alternate routes for emergency evacuation of
   people to safer terrain during an exigency.},

Title = {Gradient Path Labelling method and tracking method for calculation of
   solar differential rotation using coronal bright points},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {168-175},

Abstract = {With new space missions, such as Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), solar
   images are being produced in unprecedented volumes. To derive, as much
   as possible, information on evolution of solar activity from those huge
   datasets, the scientific community needs a new generation of software
   tools for automatic and efficient data processing. In the last decade,
   several research teams have been developing tools for obtaining more
   precise estimations of the solar rotation profile, but more are needed
   to improve knowledge about solar activity. We applied here a
   segmentation algorithm called Gradient Path Labelling (GPL), used
   originally to identify drusens in medical retinal images, to detect and
   track the coronal bright points (CBPs) using images from the AIA
   instrument onboard the SDO satellite. The CBPs have a tendency to change
   shape and size along time, to disappear and reappear at a corresponding
   heliographic position, therefore, decision trees were also included in
   the tracking solution. Since our CBP detection algorithm uses an active
   region mask to filter out the CBPs, whose centroid is inside the active
   regions, the number of identifications clearly depends on the level of
   solar activity. Our approach uses the commonly applied fitting relation
   to the latitudinal dependence of the rotational velocity, which resulted
   in calculation of the optimum fit parameters as well as the Gegenbauer
   orthogonal polynomials. Comparison of these parameters with the results
   presented in recent papers on this topic shows that our rotational
   velocity profile indicates slightly lower rotational velocities than the
   profiles obtained with other approaches. We also calculate the
   meridional motion of the CBPs, but comparison with other authors
   results, clearly show that a 3-day time interval is too short to
   estimate the latitudinal dependence of the CBP meridional motion.
   Distributions of the rotational velocity and meridional motion velocity
   uncertainties show that 85\% of uncertainty values are lower than 1
   degree/day. The evaluation of our test results shows that the applied
   algorithm is a promising tool that can help to refine the solar
   rotational profile. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Investigation of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and NO<sub>x</sub>- related

Abstract = {In this study, NO2 columns from the US EPA Models-3/CMAQ model
   simulations carried out using the 2001 ACE-ASIA (Asia Pacific Regional
   Aerosol Characterization Experiment) emission inventory over East Asia
   were compared with the GOME-derived NO2 columns. There were large
   discrepancies between the CMAQ-predicted and GOME-derived NO2 columns in
   the fall and winter seasons. In particular, while the CMAQ-predicted NO2
   columns produced larger values than the GOME-derived NO2 columns over
   South Korea for all four seasons, the CMAQ-predicted NO2 columns
   produced smaller values than the GOME-derived NO2 columns over North
   China for all seasons with the exception of summer (summer anomaly). It
   is believed that there might be some error in the NOx emission estimates
   as well as uncertainty in the NOx chemical loss rates over North China
   and South Korea. Regarding the latter, this study further focused on the
   biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions that were strongly coupled with NOx
   chemistry during summer in East Asia. This study also investigated
   whether the CMAQ-modeled NO2/NOx ratios with the possibly overestimated
   isoprene emissions were higher than those with reduced isoprene
   emissions. Although changes in both the NOx chemical loss rates and
   NO2/NOx ratios from CMAQ-modeling with the different isoprene emissions
   affected the CMAQ-modeled NO2 levels, the effects were found to be
   limited, mainly due to the low absolute levels of NO2 in summer.
   Seasonal variations of the NOx emission fluxes over East Asia were
   further investigated by a set of sensitivity runs of the CMAQ model.
   Although the results still exhibited the summer anomaly possibly due to
   the uncertainties in both NOx-related chemistry in the CMAQ model and
   the GOME measurements, it is believed that consideration of both the
   seasonal variations in NOx emissions and the correct BVOC emissions in
   East Asia are critical. Overall, it is estimated that the NOx emissions
   are underestimated by similar to 57.3\% in North China and overestimated
   by similar to 46.1\% in South Korea over an entire year. In order to
   confirm the uncertainty in NOx emissions, the NOx emissions over South
   Korea and China were further investigated using the ACE-ASIA, REAS
   (Regional Emission inventory in ASia), and CAPSS (Clean Air Policy
   Support System) emission inventories. The comparison between the
   CMAQ-calculated and GOME-derived NO2 columns indicated that both the
   ACE-ASIA and REAS inventories have some uncertainty in NOx emissions
   over North China and South Korea, which can also lead to some errors in
   modeling the formation of ozone and secondary aerosols in South Korea
   and North China.},

   solve one of the most important tasks of the mobile communication as
   Radio Frecance planning without the 2D and 3D digital maps. The
   compiling of such maps is much more efficient by means of the space
   images. Because the quality of the space images has been improved and
   developed, especially at the both spectral and spatial resolution
   points. It has been possible to to use 8 Band images with the spatial
   resolution of 50 sm.
   At present, in relation to the function 3G of mobile communications one
   of the main issues facing mobile operator companies is a high-precision
   3D digital maps. It should be noted that the number of mobile phone
   users in the Republic of Azerbaijan went forward other Community of
   Independent States Countries.
   Of course, using of aerial images for 3D mapping would be optimal.
   However, depending on a number of technical and administrative problems
   aerial photography cannot be used. Therefore, the experience of many
   countries shows that it will be more effective to use the space images
   with the higher resolution for these issues.vertical bar
   Concerning the fact that the mobile communication within the city of
   Baku has included 3G function there were ordered stereo images wih the
   spatial resolution of 50 cm for the 150 sq.km territory occupying the
   central part of the city in order to compile 3D digital maps. The images
   collected from the WorldView-2 satellite are 4-Band Bundle(Pan+MS1)
   stereo images. Such kind of imagery enable to automatically classificate
   some required clutter classes. Meanwhile, there were created 12 GPS
   points in the territory and there have been held some appropriate
   observations in these points for the geodesic reference of the space
   images in the territory. Moreover, it would like to mention that there
   have been constructed 37 permanently acting GPS stations in the
   territory of Azerbaijan at present. It significantly facilitates the
   process of the geodesic reference of the space images in order to
   accomplish such kind of mentioned projects.
   The processing of the collected space images was accomplished by means
   of Erdas LPS 10 program. In the first stage there was created the main
   component of the 3D maps-Digital Elevevation Model. In this model the
   following clutter classes are presented:
   Open; Open areas in urban; Airport, Sea, Inland water; Forest; Parks in
   urban; Semi Open Area; Open Wet Area; Urban / Urban Mean; Dense urban,
   Villages, Industrial / Commercial, Residential / Suburban; Dense
   residential / Suburban; Block of BUILDINGS; Dense Urban High; Buildings,
   Urban Mixed, Mixed dense urban},

Abstract = {Soil moisture estimation is an integral component of operational
   hydrology including flood forecasting, drought monitoring, catchment
   management, and groundwater recharge estimation. Typically, soil
   moisture information is required at variable spatial scales for the
   above applications. As a result, soil moisture data at one spatial scale
   are often aggregated to larger areas or disaggregated to smaller areas
   for a particular application. There is also increasing demand for
   accurate downscaling of satellite derived data to smaller spatial
   resolutions. This transition in spatial scale is often fraught with
   uncertainties because of the high spatio-temporal variability of soil
   moisture. However, the rank of soil moisture at a particular location in
   relation to other spatial locations is widely known to be temporally
   stable at a certain probability. The concept of temporal persistence of
   soil moisture offers the potential to better estimate soil moisture
   across spatial scales. The application of temporal persistence for
   estimation of soil moisture across spatial scales has not been
   thoroughly investigated in the literature. As a result, this study
   examines the relationship between the rank stability of soil moisture
   and physiographic features including vegetation types and soil texture
   groups. This investigation provides physiographic explanations for
   temporal persistence of soil moisture, and therefore facilitate soil
   moisture estimation across scales.
   To assess the estimation across scales, soil moisture data for three
   spatial resolutions of 12-k m, 5-k m, and 1-km data for the Yanco region
   in New South Wales, Australia were used. The soil moisture data for the
   12-k m, 5-k m and 1-k m resolutions are land surface model estimates
   obtained from the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES). The
   vegetation data set was obtained from the Australian National Dynamic
   Land Cover Data set (DLCD). The DLCD was generated from a 16-day
   Enhanced Vegetation Index composite collected at 250-m resolution from
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) for the period
   from 2000 to 2008. The DLCD has land cover features clustered into 34
   ISO classes with descriptions for the structural character of
   vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops and
   pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open
   grasslands.
   The soil texture data set was derived from the Digital Atlas of
   Australian Soils which was obtained from the Australian Soil Resource
   Information System (ASRIS). ASRIS provides a digital map of soil types
   and their descriptions, typical ranges for soil properties for each soil
   type, morphology, and physical properties of soil profiles. The soil
   classification in ASRIS has six main textural groups including sands,
   sandy loams, loams, clay loams, clay, and light clays. Moreover, the
   meteorological forcing data including short and long wave incoming
   radiation, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, pressure, and
   specific humidity were obtained from the Australian Community Climate
   Earth-System Simulator - Australian (ACCESS-A) at hourly time step with
   approximately 12-k m spatial resolution. The ACCESS-A precipitation data
   set was bias corrected using a 5-k m gridded precipitation data from the
   Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) data obtained through the
   Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
   The results identified temporally stable locations between the three
   resolution pairs with a percent relative difference of about 6\% maximum
   and 0.1\% minimum; indicating that the overall difference for
   downscaling soil moisture across the three resolution pairs is about 3\%
   of the original value. It was found that temporal stability of soil
   moisture can facilitate downscaling of soil moisture across different
   spatial scales, with improved accuracy for decreasing size of spatial
   resolution. Soil texture and vegetation land cover do not provide strong
   indicators to identify temporally stable locations, with vegetation
   cover having a higher correlation than soil texture because of its high
   homogeneity in the Yanco area.},

Title = {Proximate weather patterns and spring green-up phenology effect Eurasian
   beaver (Castor fiber) body mass and reproductive success: the
   implications of climate change and topography},

Abstract = {Low spring temperatures have been found to benefit mobile herbivores by
   reducing the rate of spring-flush, whereas high rainfall increases
   forage availability. Cold winters prove detrimental, by increasing
   herbivore thermoregulatory burdens. Here we examine the effects of
   temperature and rainfall variability on a temperate sedentary herbivore,
   the Eurasian beaver, Castor fiber, in terms of inter-annual variation in
   mean body weight and per territory offspring production. Data pertain to
   198 individuals, over 11years, using capture-mark-recapture. We use
   plant growth (tree cores) and fAPAR (a satellite-derived plant
   productivity index) to examine potential mechanisms through which
   weather conditions affect the availability and the seasonal phenology of
   beaver forage. Juvenile body weights were lighter after colder winters,
   whereas warmer spring temperatures were associated with lighter adult
   body weights, mediated by enhanced green-up phenology rates.
   Counter-intuitively, we observed a negative association between rainfall
   and body weight in juveniles and adults, and also with reproductive
   success. Alder, Alnus incana, (n=68) growth rings (principal beaver food
   in the study area) exhibited a positive relationship with rainfall for
   trees growing at elevations >2m above water level, but a negative
   relationship for trees growing <0.5m. We deduce that temperature
   influences beavers at the landscape scale via effects on spring green-up
   phenology and winter thermoregulation. Rainfall influences beavers at
   finer spatial scales through topographical interactions with plant
   growth, where trees near water level, prone to water logging, producing
   poorer forage in wetter years. Unlike most other herbivores, beavers are
   an obligate aquatic species that utilize a restricted central-place'
   foraging range, limiting their ability to take advantage of better
   forage growth further from water during wetter years. With respect to
   anthropogenic climate change, interactions between weather variables,
   plant phenology and topography on forage growth are instructive, and
   consequently warrant examination when developing conservation management
   strategies for populations of medium to large herbivores.},

Title = {Do the morphological characteristics of Chilean gravel-bed rivers
   exhibit latitudinal patterns?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Gravel-bed rivers exhibit remarkable dynamics and distinctive
   morphological patterns which influence the biological processes, as well
   as the river ecosystem resilience to human impacts. Classifications of
   river ecosystems into groups with morphologically distinct patterns are
   therefore of paramount importance for a better understanding of their
   dynamics, their management and conservation.
   Investigations on fluvial morphology and the related dynamics in Chilean
   gravel-bed rivers are still scarce, and, so far, no efforts have been
   made to identify latitudinal patterns of their morphological
   characteristics that may serve as a basis for further classification
   purposes. In fact, the great variability in bio-geographic, climatic,
   geologic and geomorphologic settings of the country offer an almost
   unique opportunity to study how the morphological characteristics of
   gravel-bed rivers may vary within extremely heterogeneous environments.
   We performed a regional analysis of nineteen Chilean gravel-bed rivers,
   from semi-arid Mediterranean to rainy temperate conditions (latitude
   ranging from 32 degrees S to 39 degrees S). Planform characteristics
   within these reaches were identified through interpretation of satellite
   images. Topographic features of the river basins were derived from open
   source digital elevation models and water discharge values were obtained
   from available national databases.
   We addressed the following research questions: a) can these 19 rivers be
   grouped into clusters considering their distinct planform
   characteristics of the river channel and basin features, as related to
   latitudinal gradients?, b) do river morphological characteristics vary
   along the analyzed latitudinal gradient?, c) does the distribution of
   specific geomorphic units (i.e. islands) follow a longitudinal pattern?,
   and finally, d) are these units associated to specific hidrogeomorfic
   characteristics?
   We generated a clustering which reflects latitudinal and morphological
   gradients in Chilean gravel-bed rivers, with the northernmost and
   southernmost rivers grouped according to their distinctive
   hydro-morphological characteristics and geomorphic units. We also
   observed a general tendency of an increase in the proportion of fluvial
   islands relative to the active channel area from the 33 degrees Latitude
   in southward direction.},

Title = {SGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy practice for right-sided breast cancer
   combined with RNI: A retrospective study on dosimetry and setup accuracy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {BackgroundWe retrospectively studied the dosimetry and setup accuracy of
   deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) radiotherapy in right-sided breast
   cancer patients with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who had completed
   treatment based on surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT) technology by
   Sentinel/Catalyst system, aiming to clarify the clinical application
   value and related issues. MethodsDosimetric indicators of four organs at
   risk (OARs), namely the heart, right coronary artery (RCA), right lung,
   and liver, were compared on the premise that the planning target volume
   met dose-volume prescription requirements. Meanwhile, the patients were
   divided into the edge of the xiphoid process (EXP), sternum middle (SM),
   and left breast wall (LBW) groups according to different positions of
   respiratory gating primary points. The CBCT setup error data of the
   three groups were contrasted for the treatment accuracy study, and the
   effects of different gating window heights on the right lung volume
   increases were compared among the three groups. ResultsCompared with
   free breath (FB), DIBH reduced the maximum dose of heart and RCA by
   739.3 +/- 571.2 cGy and 509.8 +/- 403.8 cGy, respectively (p < 0.05).
   The liver changed the most in terms of the mean dose (916.9 +/- 318.9
   cGy to 281.2 +/- 150.3 cGy, p < 0.05). The setup error of the EXP group
   in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction was 3.6 +/- 4.5 mm, which is
   the highest among the three groups. The right lung volume increases in
   the EXP, SM, and LBW groups were 72.3\%, 69.9\%, and 67.2\%,
   respectively (p = 0.08), and the corresponding breath-holding heights
   were 13.5 +/- 3.7 mm, 10.3 +/- 2.4 mm, and 9.6 +/- 2.8 mm, respectively
   (p < 0.05). ConclusionsSGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy can better protect
   the four OARs of right-sided breast cancer patients with RNI. Different
   respiratory gating primary points have different setup accuracy and
   breath-hold height.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges we face
   today. The impacts of rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme
   weather events are already being felt around the world and are only
   expected to worsen in the coming years. To mitigate and adapt to these
   impacts, we need innovative, data-driven solutions. Artificial
   intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for climate change
   adaptation, offering a range of capabilities that can help identify
   vulnerable areas, simulate future climate scenarios, and assess risks
   and opportunities for businesses and infrastructure. With the ability to
   analyze large volumes of data from climate models, satellite imagery,
   and other sources, AI can provide valuable insights that can inform
   decision-making and help us prepare for the impacts of climate change.
   However, the use of AI in climate change adaptation also raises
   important ethical considerations and potential biases that must be
   addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy these solutions, it is
   crucial to ensure that they are transparent, fair, and equitable. In
   this context, this article explores the latest innovations and future
   directions in AI-enabled climate change adaptation strategies,
   highlighting both the potential benefits and the ethical considerations
   that must be considered. By harnessing the power of AI for climate
   change adaptation, we can work towards a more resilient, sustainable,
   and equitable future for all.},

Title = {Detection of the Coupling between Vegetation Leaf Area and Climate in a
   Multifunctional Watershed, Northwestern China},

Abstract = {Accurate detection and quantification of vegetation dynamics and drivers
   of observed climatic and anthropogenic change in space and time is
   fundamental for our understanding of the atmosphere-biosphere
   interactions at local and global scales. This case study examined the
   coupled spatial patterns of vegetation dynamics and climatic
   variabilities during the past three decades in the Upper Heihe River
   Basin (UHRB), a complex multiple use watershed in arid northwestern
   China. We apply empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and singular value
   decomposition (SVD) analysis to isolate and identify the spatial
   patterns of satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) and their close
   relationship with the variability of an aridity index (AI =
   Precipitation/Potential Evapotranspiration). Results show that UHRB has
   become increasingly warm and wet during the past three decades. In
   general, the rise of air temperature and precipitation had a positive
   impact on mean LAI at the annual scale. At the monthly scale, LAI
   variations had a lagged response to climate. Two major coupled spatial
   change patterns explained 29\% and 41\% of the LAI dynamics during
   1983-2000 and 2001-2010, respectively. The strongest connections between
   climate and LAI were found in the southwest part of the basin prior to
   2000, but they shifted towards the north central area afterwards,
   suggesting that the sensitivity of LAI to climate varied over time, and
   that human disturbances might play an important role in altering LAI
   patterns. At the basin level, the positive effects of regional climate
   warming and precipitation increase as well as local ecological
   restoration efforts overwhelmed the negative effects of overgrazing. The
   study results offer insights about the coupled effects of climatic
   variability and grazing on ecosystem structure and functions at a
   watershed scale. Findings from this study are useful for land managers
   and policy makers to make better decisions in response to climate change
   in the study region.},

Title = {Land Use/Land Cover Change Impact on Hydrological Process in the Upper
   Baro Basin, Ethiopia},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Understanding the hydrological process associated with Land Use/Land
   Cover (LU/LC) change is vital for decision-makers in improving human
   wellbeing. LU/LC change significantly affects the hydrology of the
   landscape, caused by anthropogenic activities. The scope of this study
   is to investigate the impact of LU/LC change on the hydrological process
   of Upper Baro Basin for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. The Soil Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used for the simulation of the
   streamflow. The required data for the SWAT model are soils obtained from
   the Food and Agriculture Organization; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and
   LU/LC were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The
   meteorological data such as Rainfall, Temperature, Sunshine, Humidity,
   and Wind Speeds were obtained from the Ethiopian National Meteorological
   Agency. Data on discharge were obtained from Ministry of Water,
   Irrigation and Electricity. Ecosystems are deemed vital. Landsat images
   were used to classify the LU/LC pattern using ERDAS Imagine 2014
   software and the LU/LC were classified using the Maximum Likelihood
   Algorithm of Supervised Classification. The Sequential Uncertainty
   Fitting (SUFI-2) global sensitivity method within SWAT Calibration and
   Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was used to identify the most
   sensitive streamflow parameters. The calibration was carried out using
   observed streamflow data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2002 and a
   validation period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2009. LU/LC
   analysis shows that there was a drastic decrease of grassland by 15.64\%
   and shrubland by 9.56\% while an increase of agricultural land and
   settlement by 18.01\% and 13.01\%, respectively, for 30 years. The
   evaluation of the SWAT model presented that the annual surface runoff
   increased by 43.53 mm, groundwater flow declined by 27.58 mm, and
   lateral flow declined by 5.63 mm. The model results showed that the
   streamflow characteristics changed due to the LU/LC change during the
   study periods 1987-2017 such as change of flood frequency, increased
   peak flows, base flow, soil erosion, and annual mean discharge. Curve
   number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, and soil
   evaporation composition factor were the most sensitive parameters
   identified for the streamflow. Both the calibration and validation
   results disclosed a good agreement between measured and simulated
   streamflow. The performance of the model statistical test shows the
   coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency
   values 0.87 and 0.81 for calibration periods of 1990-2002 and 0.84 and
   0.76 for the validation period of 2003 to 2009, respectively. Overall,
   LU/LC significantly affected the hydrological condition of the
   watershed. Therefore, different conservation strategies to maintain the
   stability and resilience of the ecosystem are vital.},

Title = {How to avoid eutrophication in coastal seas? A new approach to derive

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {628-629},
Pages = {400-414},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Since 1950, increase in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) river loadings
   in the North-East Atlantic (NEA) continental seas has induced a deep
   change in the marine coastal ecosystems, leading to eutrophication
   symptoms in some areas. In order to recover a Good Ecological Status
   (GES) in the NEA, as required by European Water Framework Directive
   (WFD) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), reductions in N-
   and P-river loadings are necessary but they need to be minimal due to
   their economic impact on the farming industry. In the frame of the
   ``EMoSEM{''} European project, we used two marine 3D ecological models
   (ECO-MARS3D, MIRO\&CO) covering the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel
   and the southern North Sea to estimate the contributions of various
   sources (riverine, oceanic and atmospheric) to the winter nitrate and
   phosphate marine concentrations. The various distributed descriptors
   provided by the simulations allowed also to find a log-linear
   relationship between the 90th percentile of satellite-derived
   chlorophyll concentrations and the ``fully bioavailable{''} nutrients,
   i.e. simulated nutrient concentrations weighted by light and
   stoichiometric limitation factors. Any GES threshold on the 90th
   percentile of marine chlorophyll concentration can then be translated in
   maximum admissible `fully bioavailable' DIN and DIP concentrations, from
   which an iterative linear optimization method can compute river-specific
   minimal abatements of N and P loadings. The method has been applied to
   four major river groups, assuming either a conservative (8 mu g Chl L-1)
   or a more socially acceptable (15 mu g Chl L-1) GES chlorophyll
   concentration threshold. In the conservative case, maximum admissible
   winter concentrations for nutrients correspond to marine background
   values, whereas in the lenient case, they are close to values
   recommended by the WFD/MSFD. Both models suggest that to reach
   chlorophyll GES, strong reductions of DIN and DIP are required in the
   Eastern French and Belgian-Dutch river groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Early Detection of Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus by Hyperspectral Imaging
   and Outlier Removal Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Nets
   (OR-AC-GAN)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Tomato spotted wilt virus is a wide-spread plant disease in the world.
   It can threaten thousands of plants with a persistent and propagative
   manner. Early disease detection is expected to be able to control the
   disease spread, to facilitate management practice, and further to
   guarantee accompanying economic benefits. Hyperspectral imaging, a
   powerful remote sensing tool, has been widely applied in different
   science fields, especially in plant science domain. Rich spectral
   information makes disease detection possible before visible disease
   symptoms showing up. In the paper, a new hyperspectral analysis proximal
   sensing method based on generative adversarial nets (GAN) is proposed,
   named as outlier removal auxiliary classifier generative adversarial
   nets (OR-AC-GAN). It is an all-in-one method, which integrates the tasks
   of plant segmentation, spectrum classification and image classification.
   The model focuses on image pixels, which can effectively visualize
   potential plant disease positions, and keep experts' attention on these
   diseased pixels. Meanwhile, this new model can improve the performances
   of classic spectrum band selection methods, including the maximum
   variance principle component analysis (MVPCA), fast density-peak-based
   clustering, and similarity-based unsupervised band selection. Selecting
   spectrum wavebands reasonably is an important preprocessing step in
   spectroscopy/hyperspectral analysis applications, which can reduce the
   computation time for potential in-field applications, affect the
   prediction results and make the hyperspectral analysis results
   explainable. In the experiment, the hyperspectral reflectance imaging
   system covers the spectral range from 395 nm to 1005 nm. The proprosed
   model makes use of 83 bands to do the analysis. The plant level
   classification accuracy gets 96.25\% before visible symptoms shows up.
   The pixel prediction false positive rate in healthy plants gets as low
   as 1.47\%. Combining the OR-AC-GAN with three existing band selection
   algorithms, the performance of these band selection models can be
   significantly improved. Among them, MVPCA can leverage only 8 spectrum
   bands to get the same plant level classification accuracy as OR-AC-GAN,
   and the pixel prediction false positive rate in healthy plants is
   1.57\%, which is also comparable to OR-AC-GAN. This new model can be
   potentially transferred to other plant diseases detection applications.
   Its property to boost the performance of existing band selection methods
   can also accelerate the in-field applications of hyperspectral imaging
   technology.},

Title = {Monitoring of large-scale forest restoration: Evidence of vegetation
   recovery and reversing chronic ecosystem degradation in the mountain
   region of Pakistan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global ecosystem restoration efforts are aimed at climate change
   mitigation. In response to the challenge of global warming and
   supporting local adaptation, the Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation
   Program (BTAP) was launched in 2014 to restore depleted forest
   ecosystems by extensive afforestation and/or reforestation in the Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. Under the BTAP, afforestation of all
   categories was carried out in an area of 300,000 ha, and 160 million
   plants were distributed under Farm Forestry and 4509 enclosures were
   established for Assisting Natural Regeneration (ANR) with the help of
   the local community. The present study evaluated historic deforestation
   trends using bi-temporal (1990-2010) change analysis and the performance
   of recent forest ecosystem restoration efforts based on time series
   analysis of stallite images. A total of 226 afforestation sites of the
   BTAP - Phase I were examined to determine the vegetation growth and
   evidence of ecosystem restoration efforts by regression and trend
   analysis of the annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   composites from 2014 to 2021. The forest plantation and protected
   natural regeneration performance across the three key forest management
   regions of the Southern, Malakand and Northern zones remained variable,
   with growth values of 29\%, 47\% and 24\%, respectively. The results
   suggest that the three forest regions lost 3.2\% of the forest between
   1990 and 2010. While accounting for most conservative figures validated
   from satellite data, the BTAP interventions during 2014-2018 improved
   the overall forest cover from 14.5\% to 16.5\% in these regions. The
   framework developed in this study and the derived results can help to
   formulate an evidence-based assessment of indicators for ecological
   restoration and nature-based solutions.},

Title = {Recovery of renal function in Black South African patients with
   malignant hypertension: Superiority of continuous ambulatory peritoneal
   dialysis over hemodialysis},

Abstract = {Objective:To describe recovery of renal function (RC) in Black South
   African patients with primary malignant hypertension (MHT) and end-stage
   renal failure, according to the type of dialysis provided.
   Design: A retrospective analysis of the records of 31 patients with MHT.
   Setting: A university-based, large tertiary-care hospital and its
   community-based satellite continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
   (CAPD) clinics.
   Patients: Only patients with renal failure caused by MHT and who were on
   dialysis between January 1997 and June 2000. There were 11 patients on
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) that regained renal function; 11 patients on
   hemodialysis (HD), none of whom recovered renal function; and 9 patients
   on PD who did not recover renal function during the same time period.
   Outcome Measures: The groups were investigated for variables that might
   predict RC.
   Results: Peritoneal dialysis compared with HD was highly significant as
   an indicator of RC (p < 0.0001), with 60\% of patients on PD regaining
   renal function, versus 0\% on HD. Median time to recovery was 300
   (150-365) days. There was no significant difference in decline of mean
   arterial pressure (MAP) between the groups; MAP declined significantly
   in all groups (p = 0.00002). All groups received similar drug therapy.
   In the RC group, initial MAP, kidney size, and urine output tended to be
   higher and creatinine lower (p = not significant). Dialysis adequacy was
   similar in the different groups.
   Conclusions: This retrospective study suggests there may be benefit from
   PD as the primary form of dialysis when patients have MHT as a cause of
   their renal failure. Possible predictors of RC include blood pressure
   control, initial MAP, initial serum creatinine, initial urine output,
   and kidney size. Time should be allowed for RC before transplantation is
   undertaken. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the benefit of
   CAPD in patients with MHT.},

Title = {Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at a high spatiotemporal
   resolution using constrained mixed-effect bagging models with MAIAC
   aerosol optical depth},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {217},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Exposure estimation of fine particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 mu m
   (PM2.5) at high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial to epidemiological
   studies that examine acute or sub-chronic health outcomes of PM2.5.
   However, exposure assessment of PM2.5 has been negatively affected by
   sparsely distributed monitoring stations. In addition, several
   limitations exist among the existing methods for high spatiotemporal
   resolution PM2.5 estimation, including ignorance or limited use of
   spatial autocorrelation, single-model methods, and use of aerosol
   optical depth data with non-random missingness. These limitations
   probably introduce bias or high uncertainty in model estimation. In this
   paper, we proposed an approach of constrained mixed-effect bagging
   models to leverage advanced algorithm of the high-resolution AOD
   retrieved by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction
   (MAIAC), with other spatiotemporal predictors and spatial
   autocorrelation to reliably estimate PM2.5 at a high spatiotemporal
   resolution. Our base model was a daily mixed-effect spatial model that
   accounted for spatial autocorrelation using embedded structured and
   unstructured spatial random effects. Point estimates from the base
   models were then averaged based on the bootstrap aggregating (bagging)
   to reduce variance in prediction. Then, constrained optimization was
   developed to minimize the impact of missing AOD and to capture a full
   time-series of PM2.5 concentration. Our daily-level bagging allowed
   AOD-PM2.5 association and spatial autocorrelation to vary daily, which
   substantially improved the model performance. As a case study of daily
   PM2.5 predictions in 2014 in Shandong Province, China, our approach
   achieved R-2 of 0.87 (RMSE: 18.6 mu g/m(3)) in cross validation, and R-2
   of 0.75 (RMSE: 20.6 mu g/m(3)) in an independent test, similar to or
   better than most existing methods. We further extended the 2014 models
   to simulate 2014-2016 full time-series of biweekly average PM2.5
   concentrations with no use of covariates in 2015-2016 but constrained
   optimization over 2014 daily point estimates; the results showed
   well-captured temporal trend with a total correlation of 0.81 between
   the simulated and observed values from 2015 to 2016. Our approach can be
   applied for other regions for exposure estimation of PM2.5 when
   measurements alone are not able to capture the desirable spatial and
   temporal resolutions.},

Title = {Factors Associated With Osteoporosis Care of Men Hospitalized for Hip
   Fracture: A Retrospective Cohort Study},
Journal = {JBMR PLUS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rates of postfracture DXA and pharmacotherapy appear to be declining
   despite their known benefits in fracture reduction. We sought to
   identify factors associated with osteoporosis care among male veterans
   aged 50 years and older after hip fracture and to evaluate trends in
   rates of care with an observational cohort design using US Department of
   Veterans Affairs' (VA) inpatient, pharmacy, and outpatient encounters
   and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services outpatient pharmacy
   claims (2007 to 2014) from men aged 50 years and older treated for hip
   fracture (N = 7317). We used the Cox proportional hazards model with
   random effects for the admitting facility. A sensitivity analysis was
   performed for a subset of patients aged 65 to 99 dually enrolled in
   Medicare (N = 5821). Overall, approximately 13\% of patients had
   evidence of osteoporosis care within one year of fracture. In the
   adjusted model, rural residence was associated with lower likelihood of
   care, and several comorbidities were associated with higher likelihood
   of receiving care. In sensitivity analyses of patients dually enrolled
   in Medicare, rural residence remained associated with lower likelihood
   of osteoporosis care. Overall rates of care decreased over time, but
   rates of DXA in the VA remained stable. These findings highlight the
   ongoing problem of low rates of postfracture care among a population
   with the highest risk of future fracture and its associated morbidity
   and mortality. The rural disparity in care and differences in rates of
   care across healthcare delivery systems illustrates the importance of
   healthcare delivery systems in promoting pharmacotherapy and DXA after
   sentinel events. Because the VA removes a majority of cost barriers to
   care, this integrated healthcare system may outperform the private
   sector in access to care. However, declining rates of pharmacotherapy
   imply knowledge gaps that undermine quality care. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for
   Prioritizing Dam Removal},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation
   benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow
   regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present
   study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of
   Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance
   between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological
   benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four
   sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream
   connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities
   for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the
   movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The
   proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir
   (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However,
   before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the
   connectivity results will be balanced with other important
   socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an
   inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an
   observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of
   any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on
   surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the
   riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others.
   All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also
   included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network.
   The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were
   processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for
   inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability.
   These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to
   calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used
   to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria.
   The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega
   and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed
   obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For
   the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may
   constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this
   case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this
   connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity,
   it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that
   critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of
   field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement
   along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the
   implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam
   removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define
   exclusion areas for additional obstacles.},

   research, the morphodynamic behavior of the coastal area (e.g.,
   hydrodynamic and sedimentary state, morphology, orientation, etc.), the
   current wave conditions (extreme and dominant waves, wave exposure), and
   also external factors, such as human impact and the geotechnical
   condition of the wider area, are examined. Short- and
   medium-to-long-term analysis took place, such as mapping, sediment
   analysis, wave/wind analysis, numerical modeling, and satellite
   monitoring, in order to identify the dynamic forcing parameters related
   to geomorphology, sedimentology, and hydrology that prevail in the area.
   Additionally, the intense tectonics, the karstified limestones, and the
   steep slopes of the cliffs in combination with the frequent seismic
   events on the island set up a geotechnically unstable area, which often
   cause landslides on the beach of Myrtos; these supply the beach with a
   large amount of aggregates, constituting the main sediment supply. Wave
   exposure forcing conditions, longshore-rip current direction, and other
   hydrodynamic processes are stable with high values in the area, causing
   notable sediment transport within the bay boundaries. As a result, at
   Myrtos Bay there is a dynamic balance of the natural system, which is
   directly affected by human interventions. Taking also into consideration
   that Myrtos is one of the most famous beaches in Greece and one of the
   main attractions of Cephalonia Island with thousands of visitors every
   year, beach management must be focused on preserving the natural system
   of the coastal area.},

Abstract = {At a time when growing populations are taxing the earth's resources as
   never before, natural resource managers and users are discovering the
   power of geospotial technologies. These evolving technologies, once
   expensive and exclusive to domains of researchers and scientists, are
   now the choice of local, state, and national resource managers around
   the globe. This research presents the results of a preliminary survey of
   benefits and limitations of geospatial technologies for natural
   resources applications in the state of Florida. The survey was sent to
   users and producers of relevant geospatial technologies applicable to
   natural resource management. Results from 134 respondents show that 98\%
   of the organizations surveyed still conduct field surveys for data
   collection, monitoring, and inventories, while 88\% of those
   organizations develop maps to summarize and visualize their data.
   Approximately 87\% of the surveyed organizations use one or many types
   of geospatial technologies to collect, visualize, integrate, or
   interpret their information about natural resources with the most common
   technologies being aerial imagery, geographic information systems, and
   global positioning systems, followed by topographic maps and satellite
   imagery. However, there were also some available technologies in which
   their capabilities were little known or appreciated by these
   organizations such as terrestrial light detection and ranging and
   integrated mapping technology. These results will serve as a source of
   information regarding how geospatiial technologies are used in Florida
   and their current real or perceived limitations. The study is also
   important for educational institutions and producers to provide
   appropriate training for basic technologies and to encourage users to
   integrate the latest and cost-effective geospatial technologies
   efficiently.},

Title = {Axillary web syndrome self-assessment questionnaire: Initial development

Abstract = {Introduction: Despite the great strides made in medical knowledge,
   surgery still remains a necessary part of the breast cancer treatment.
   Surgical procedures still lead to post surgical sequelae. The axillary
   web syndrome (AWS) is one such sequela, which can lead to disability,
   reduced arm mobility and compromised quality of life. It is often
   unidentified and the literature regarding its assessment is limited.
   To improve diagnosis and patient education, the Screening Test AWS
   (ST-AWS) questionnaire was drafted and applied at the European Institute
   of Oncology (EIO).
   Materials and method: We prospectively recruited patients from October
   2012 to December 2012. Patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy
   and/or axillary dissection procedures were registered. Physical
   examination was set as a gold standard.
   Results: 88 patients completed the questionnaire. Among these, 32
   patients had axillary web syndrome diagnosed, thus a 36\% incidence.
   The questionnaire achieved a sensitivity of 94\%, a specificity of 91\%,
   a positive prevalence value (PPV) of 86\%, a negative prevalence value
   (NPV) of 96\% and an accuracy of 92\%.
   Conclusion: Our questionnaire achieves high sensitivity and predictive
   values, and we would recommend it as a screening-tool for auto-diagnosis
   of the AWS.
   The main objective of the questionnaire is to enhance patient and
   therapist awareness of the problem, and prompt management to shorten the
   effects of this disability. Moreover, it may offer a tool to enhance
   body image acceptance after surgery.
   Further studies whereby the efficacy of the questionnaire is
   investigated in a larger, heterogeneous group and in different
   situations are warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article explores the experiences of liminality through the accounts
   of Chinese students on a UK-based MBA programme. The transient nature of
   the MBA experience, as well as the international status of the Chinese
   student, is resonant with conceptualizations of liminality as `in
   between' space. Based on semi-structured interviews with 20 MBA
   graduates who had subsequently returned to China with their
   qualification, we explored their perceptions of outcomes from the course
   and their experiences as international students on a programme imbued
   with western norms and values. Results support the unsettling yet
   creative implications of liminality, as well as the fragmented insecure
   nature of identities, as individuals pass through the MBA `rite of
   passage' in terms of `becoming' a manager and entering a new phase of
   career. Accounts suggest the creation of hierarchical structures within
   liminal space whereby Chinese students, through their positioning at the
   margin, have uncomfortable yet illuminating encounters with alterity. At
   the same time, they experience levels of ambiguity and uncertainty in
   the post-liminal phase of China-located employments, as new
   western-based managerial identities collide with dominant discourses of
   Chinese organization.},

Title = {Preliminary analysis to estimate the spatial distribution of benefits of

Volume = {10},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has been experiencing annual
   cyanobacterial blooms that often cover large portions of the western
   basin and even reach into the central basin. These blooms have affected
   several ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie to surrounding
   communities (notably drinking water quality). Several modeling efforts
   have identified the springtime total bioavailable phosphorus (TBP) load
   as a major driver of maximum cyanobacterial biomass in western Lake
   Erie, and on this basis, international water management bodies have set
   a phosphorus (P) reduction goal. This P reduction goal is intended to
   reduce maximum cyanobacterial biomass, but there has been very limited
   effort to identify the specific locations within the western basin of
   Lake Erie that will likely experience the most benefits. Here, we used
   pixel-specific linear regression to identify where annual variation in
   spring TBP loads is most strongly associated with cyanobacterial
   abundance, as inferred from satellite imagery. Using this approach, we
   find that annual TBP loads are most strongly associated with
   cyanobacterial abundance in the central and southern areas of the
   western basin. At the location of the Toledo water intake, the
   association between TBP load and cyanobacterial abundance is moderate,
   and in Maumee Bay (near Toledo, Ohio), the association between TBP and
   cyanobacterial abundance is no better than a null model. Both of these
   locations are important for the delivery of specific ecosystem services,
   but this analysis indicates that P load reductions would not be expected
   to substantially improve maximum annual cyanobacterial abundance in
   these locations. These results are preliminary in the sense that only a
   limited set of models were tested in this analysis, but these results
   illustrate the importance of identifying whether the spatial
   distribution of management benefits (in this case P load reduction)
   matches the spatial distribution of management goals (reducing the
   effects of cyanobacteria on important ecosystem services).},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This article describes a spatial prediction method that predicts the
   monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly field from the land only
   data. The land data are from the Global Historical Climatology Network
   (GHCN). The prediction period is 1880-1999 and the prediction ocean
   domain extends from 60degreesS to 60degreesN with a spatial resolution
   5degrees x 5degrees. The prediction method is a regression over the
   basis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), The EOFs are computed
   from the following data sets: (a) the Climate Prediction Center's
   optimally interpolated sea surface temperature (OI/SST) data
   (1982-1999); (b) the National Climatic Data Center's blended product of
   land-surface air temperature (1992-1999) produced from combining the
   Special Satellite Microwave Imager and GHCN: and (c) the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research Reanalysis data (1982-1999). The optimal prediction method
   minimizes the first-M-mode mean square error between the true and
   predicted anomalies over both land and ocean. In the optimization
   process, the data errors of the GHCN boxes are used, and their
   contribution to the prediction error is taken into account. The
   area-averaued root mean square error of prediction is calculated.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate that this EOF prediction method can
   accurately recover the global SST anomalies during some circulation
   patterns and add value to the SST bias correction in the early history
   of SST observations and the validation of general circulation models.
   Our results show that (i) the land only data can accurately predict the
   SST anomaly in the El Nino months when the temperature anomaly structure
   has very large correlation scales, and (ii) the predictions for La Nina,
   neutral. or transient months require more EOF modes because of the
   presence of the small scale structures in the anomaly field. Copyright

Abstract = {The geosteering process should not be seen as a process solely
   designated for the most expensive or highest profile horizontal wells.
   It can be regarded as another tool for improving the odds of success by
   remaining in the productive zone for longer periods of drilling. Also,
   it can be used to optimize the positioning of a horizontal wellbore in
   the sweet spots within the reservoir.
   The current process has been successfully applied to large infill
   drilling programs at over 40 wells for heavy oil, tight gas,
   conventional oil and gas plays and for Mannville coalbed methane (CBM)
   in Alberta. The service has been provided irrespective of location, as
   long as the Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language
   (WITSML)/Pason Satellite service is available.
   Exploration and production (E\&P) companies are continuously being
   driven to reduce the cost per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). E\&P needs

   as reduced cycle time associated with advanced forward-looking 3D
   geo-modelling and visualization technologies (Figure 1), are currently
   converging. The motivation to reduce costs has been responsible for
   advancing the horizontal well geosteering process by incorporating the
   Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tool into mainstream drilling
   practices. The universal economic benefits gained can be found in all
   resource play types (conventional oil and gas, heavy oil, tight gas and
   coalbed methane).
   It is important to note that the process described here is essentially
   collaborative, For best results, there must be cooperation between the
   E\&P operational geologist, wellsite geologist, directional driller and
   geo-modelling staff, as well as the engineering consultants involved in
   the project (i.e. the team as a whole).},

Title = {Management of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer in Immunocompromised Solid Organ
   Transplant Recipients},

Abstract = {The management of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in solid organ
   transplant recipients (OTRs) presents a variety of clinical challenges
   for physicians. OTRs are at a 65-fold increased risk for developing
   cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), the most common NMSC that
   develops after transplantation. Risk factors contributing to the
   development of NMSCs in OTRs include a past medical history of any
   previous skin cancer, a personal history of significant sun exposure and
   a fair skin complexion or phototype. Further, greater immunosuppressive
   medication levels lead to an increased risk of NMSCs. Among
   immunosuppressants, specific older agents such as azathioprine and
   cyclosporine may increase the risk of developing NMSCs in contrast to
   newer agents such as sirolimus. Early skin biopsy and treatment of
   premalignant and malignant lesions are essential for treating these
   patients successfully. In this regard, the concept of field
   cancerization has been instructive in broadening treatments to include
   entire affected areas rather than individual lesions given that the
   areas with significant ultraviolet irradiation will continue to develop
   numerous individual precancerous and cancerous lesions. Field therapy
   with photodynamic therapy or topical 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod or
   diclofenac is often used in OTRs according to individual patient
   tolerability. Prompt excision or Mohs micrographic surgery is the
   standard of care of primary, uncomplicated squamous cell and basal cell
   carcinomas. For patients with in-transit or metastatic squamous cell
   carcinomas, adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, and staging by sentinel
   lymph node dissection may be employed. For patients who develop numerous
   SCC per year, chemoprophylaxis can be effective in limiting the burden
   of disease. In consultation with the multidisciplinary transplant team,
   the immunosuppressive regimen can be revised to lower overall
   immunosuppression or altered to include newer drugs that have decreased
   oncogenic potential in OTRs. The greatest impact may be made by the
   prevention of NMSCs through simple, but rigorous, patient education on
   the benefits of UV protection, periodic self-skin examinations, and
   regular follow-ups. Accordingly, vitamin D and calcium supplementation
   should also be incorporated in transplant recipients. Management of OTRs
   requires patient education, frequent motivation for vigilance, regular
   follow-up, and interdisciplinary collaboration between transplant
   surgeons, nephrologists, hepatologists, cardiologists, transplant
   nurses, dermatologists, oncologists, pharmacists, and other relevant
   physicians ideally orchestrated by the essential transplant
   coordinators.},

Title = {Synoptic and cloud-scale aspects related to an extreme rainfall event
   that occurred in April 2019 in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)},
Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {136},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The development, rate, and duration of extreme rainfall events over a
   region depend on the coexistence and strength of multiple atmospheric
   physical conditions. Then, understanding the synoptic and cloud-scale
   aspects is a continuous, crucial integrated task between universities
   and operational centers aiming for early warning and risk management.
   This study first evaluates the large-scale atmospheric circulation,
   instability behavior, and moisture parameters before and after the start
   of rainfall. It also investigates the dynamic triggering for an extreme
   rainfall event in Rio de Janeiro between April 08th and 09th, 2019.
   Secondly, this study intended to examine the microphysics cloud aspects
   using data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
   (GOES-16). From monthly records and the 99th percentile of accumulated
   daily rainfall, it was possible to highlight the spatial rainfall
   dependence on seasonal and topography with higher rainfall values
   recorded in the south portion of the city of Rio de Janeiro. From the
   large-scale synoptic aspects, concomitant circulations related to upper,
   middle, and lower atmospheric levels creating a dynamic vertical
   structure favorable to convective development were verified over
   southeastern Brazil. The thermodynamic parameters showed different
   characteristics before and after rainfall started, suggesting
   multi-parameters' importance as so-called ``instability ingredients{''}
   for evaluating the atmospheric potential for clouds and rainfall
   development. The velocity divergence in upper atmospheric levels was a
   determinant dynamic forcing for deep convection evolution. Lastly,
   regarding the wind circulations, northwest winds before precipitation
   and a change in wind direction were related to the region's frontal
   systems passage. The cloud microphysics aspects showed that the channel
   differences approach showed that monitoring top cloud glaciation,
   vertical development, and particle size are indicators of heavy rainfall
   when the cloud top offering considerable vertical growth was a helpful
   tool to identify regions with huge potential to develop heavy rain.},

Title = {Stable isotope analysis reveals migratory origin of loggerhead turtles
   in the Southern California Bight},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {472},
Pages = {275-285},
Abstract = {Loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta in the North Pacific are listed as
   Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act and the IUCN Red List.
   Due partly to their imperiled status, the US National Marine Fisheries
   Service established a time-area closure in 2003 for the California drift
   gillnet (CDGN) fishery operating within the Southern California Bight
   (SCB) to avoid incidental captures. This closure is triggered when sea
   surface temperatures are above normal, generally caused by El
   Nino-derived warm-water conditions, which is the time when loggerheads
   are thought to enter the SCB. Knowledge of the previous foraging grounds
   of loggerheads incidentally captured by the CDGN fishery in the SCB will
   help elucidate the oceanographic mechanisms that may influence turtle
   movement into this region and can assist in optimizing the environmental
   triggers for implementation of the SCB fishing closure. Stable carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis was used to
   determine the previous foraging grounds of loggerheads encountered in
   the SCB. Skin samples from loggerheads captured in the CDGN fishery were
   compared with skin from loggerheads in the central North Pacific,
   incidentally caught in the Hawaii-based longline fishery, as well as
   skin from turtles sampled during in-water research along the Baja
   California Peninsula, Mexico. The stable isotope values of CDGN-caught
   turtles were more similar to those from the central North Pacific than
   to those from Baja, indicating movements from the central North Pacific
   to the SCB. We elaborate on potential oceanographic mechanisms by which
   turtles access the SCB and provide insights that can inform future
   management decisions for the time-area closure.},

Title = {Urban driving forces and megacity expansion threats. Study case in the
   Mexico City periphery},
Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {109-122},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The megacity proximity produces significant stress in the surrounding
   areas with fast changes in land conversion, mainly in the urban sprawl
   growth. The swiftness facilitates studies about land use changes to
   urban in short-term. The principal boosting urbanization factors, either
   socioeconomic or physical geographical, are usually identified as the
   driving forces (DF) to be considered in the regional planning programs
   and prospective urbanization modeling.
   The land-use-change-to-urban (LUCU) phenomenon was studied by Landsat
   images along the 2000 2014 period in the Northern periphery of Mexico
   Megacity. The study case was delimited in the Pachuca-Tizayuca Valley,
   Hidalgo State. Municipalities and the whole area showed high annual
   urbanization growth rates (2.89\%-4.14\%) and 3.39\%, respectively. The
   urban area's increase in each unit allowed calculation of three
   dependent variables as LUCU quantitative descriptors, which were further
   applied in three statistical approaches. In the first one, multivariate
   Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) was performed to evaluate the correlation
   coefficient (R) and the sensitivity factor (13) for the urbanization
   rate (814) vs. each socioeconomic or physical factor. In the second one,
   the urbanization ratio (U-R14) vs. independent variables mean values
   were used in spatial OLS and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)
   analysis. Finally, the third approach applied Cramer's V test based on
   the number of pixels converted to urban (PUc(14)) as LUCU descriptor and
   all independent variables. Cramer test allowed the best factors'
   analyses, while not all fitted the OLS and GWR requirements. The whole
   process leads to a methodologic pathway to identify land change DFs to
   urban use.
   The study case acknowledged the following main DF to urbanization: the
   welfare; the population growth rate; the population proportions of
   immigrants, scholar age, workers in second and third economic sector;
   and the distances to quarry stones, schools, urban areas and roads.
   Cramer's V reach 70.5 accuracy values in the urbanization modeling with
   the mentioned DFs by the Multi-Layer Perceptron of the Land Change
   Modeler (Idrisi). The spatial urban area increase in the 2029 year was
   predicted based on these DFs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Ecosystem responses dominate the trends of annual gross primary
   productivity over terrestrial ecosystems of China during 2000-2020},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {343},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The annual gross primary productivity (AGPP) forms the foundation for
   terrestrial carbon sink. AGPP trends stem from the combined impacts of
   environmental factors and ecosystem responses to those factors. These
   responses include model structure modifications altering both the
   structural properties (represented by leaf area index) and the
   functional properties (represented by per leaf AGPP). Understanding the
   contributions of ecosystem responses to AGPP trends is crucial for
   accurately assessing spatiotemporal variations in AGPP, which aids in
   effective carbon management. Based on eddy covariance measurements of
   AGPP in China, we generated AGPP during 2000-2020 by constructing yearly
   AGPP mapping schemes from site measurements and analyzed AGPP trends.
   The roles of ecosystem responses and their pathways were further
   elucidated by employing analysis of variance. Results showed that the
   total AGPP in China was 7.39 +/- 0.62 PgC yr(-1), with an increasing
   trend of 0.095 PgC yr(-2). This increase primarily sourced from the
   total AGPP in Subtropical Evergreen Needleleaf Forest. AGPP trends
   spatially decreased from east to west, with most regions showing
   positive values. Structural and functional properties contributed
   similarly to AGPP trends, with varying regional contributions. The
   structural properties played a dominant role in north regions while the
   functional properties were more important in south and west regions.
   Ecosystem responses similarly determined the trends of ecosystem
   properties, which decreased from west to east. Ecosystem responses thus
   dominated AGPP trends through the structural properties in north regions
   but through the functional properties in south and west regions.
   Therefore, Chinese AGPP exhibited a spatially varied increasing trend
   during 2000-2020. Ecosystem responses dominated AGPP trends through
   divergent properties across regions. Our results highlight the
   significanc of ecosystem responses in AGPP trends and their divergent
   pathways across regions. This also provides independent data support for
   quantifying regional carbon budgets.},

Title = {Study on habitat suitability change and habitat network of rare
   wintering cranes in important international wetlands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Chongming Dongtan wetland is a typical estuarine wetland, located in
   Chongming District, Shanghai, China, with high ecological significance.
   The protection of wintering crane's habitat has attracted the wide
   attention of the international community. Because of the importance of
   the region in the protection of international biodiversity and the
   protection of crane habitats, it is of great reference value to study
   the habitat suitability changes of rare wintering cranes with spatial
   and temporal distribution characteristics and the distribution of
   habitat corridors with spatial characteristics, to improve the habitat
   quality of crane habitats in globally important wetlands. Based on the
   remote sensing image data of Chongming Dongtan and the field survey data
   of rare wintering cranes, this study obtained the land use change of
   Chongming Dongtan from 1986 to 2021 by ENVI and ArcGIS10.8 software,
   evaluated the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in 36 years by GIS
   technology, and constructed the habitat corridor of wintering cranes by
   using the minimum cumulative resistance model(MCR). The results showed
   that from 1986 to 2021, the number of four typical wintering cranes in
   Chongming Dongtan showed a general downward trend. In the past 36 years,
   the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in the internationally
   important wetland of Chongming Dongtan has gradually changed from a
   suitable area to an unsuitable area. The suitable areas are mainly
   distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the study area, and the
   unsuitable areas are mainly distributed in the western construction land
   area. The habitat quality of cranes is deteriorating. The overall
   resistance distribution of Chongming Dongtan in 2021 shows a trend of
   low resistance value in the east and high resistance value in the west,
   and the degree of obstruction is strong in the south and weak in the
   north. There are 208 potential habitat corridors for wintering cranes in
   Chongming Dongtan, with a total length of 377.12 km. Get 127 Habitat
   nodes. The density of habitat corridors in the eastern part of the study
   area is significantly higher than that in the western region, and the
   ecological space in the eastern region is well connected. Finally, this
   study proposes the identification of important habitat corridors based
   on gravity model and the analysis of habitat network structure based on
   graph theory, which provides a reference for improving the stability of
   habitat network by means of habitat node optimization, stepping stone
   increase and ecological restoration. This study is different from
   previous studies on large-scale ecological conditions such as cities or
   urban coastal zones. From the perspective of the construction of
   regional wetland rare species habitat network and the protection of
   international important wetland biodiversity with important ecological
   value, it is helpful to optimize the suitable habitat pattern of rare
   overwintering cranes and provide a method basis for the protection of
   rare species habitat and the construction of habitat network in regional
   wetlands. At the same time, Chongming Dongtan is the only
   internationally important wetland in Shanghai. Wintering cranes are the
   most important biological resources of wetlands. The study of habitat
   suitability changes and habitat networks can effectively promote the
   development of internationally important wetland cities in Shanghai.},

Title = {Analytical Expressions of Radiocarbon Distribution in Transient State
   Unconfined Aquifers and Their Application to Determination of Past and
   Present Recharges of North Africa Aquifers},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this study, we developed two-dimensional hydrodynamic age expressions
   for the free-surface aquifer problem required for radiocarbon data
   interpretation in terms of recharge. Time-varying recharge is accounted
   for in fully transient or pseudo-steady state alternative analytical
   expressions applying to weakly or highly hydraulically reactive
   unconfined aquifers, respectively. These expressions extend the
   well-known model proposed by Vogel in 1967 and represent a convenient
   alternative approach to the more complex numerical solution of a
   particle tracking problem considering climate variability. An
   application of the developed expressions was carried out to assess past
   (40 Kyr) and present recharge rates for the North Western Sahara Aquifer
   System (NWSAS) and the Djeffara plain (Tunisia-Libya). Using the
   available C-14 data at different outcrops, we obtained local recharge
   values ranging from 0.2 +/- 1.7 to 4.5 +/- 3.2 mm yr(-1). Here, it is
   shown that using the standard purely steady-state model for radiocarbon
   interpretation leads to a present recharge overestimation of up to
   360\%. A linear relation between the present recharge and the average
   annual rainfall was obtained and used to identify the regional
   distribution of the recharge and domain-averaged values. Global values
   of 1.6 +/- 2.3 mm yr(-1) for the NWSAS and 3.5 +/- 2.3 mm yr(-1) for the
   Djeffara are in excellent agreement with the values obtained by
   hydrogeological models and derived using Satellite gravity data. The
   relation between recharge and rainfall obtained here can be used as a
   first-order estimate for hydrogeological modeling or water management
   analysis for aquifers in the Saharan area.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal changes in rate of soil loss and erosion vulnerability
   of selected region in the tropical forests of Borneo during last three
   decades},
Journal = {EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An attempt has been made to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics
   of soil erosion vulnerability and soil loss from the forested region in
   the north-eastern Borneo, Sarawak, Malaysia during the last three
   decades (1991-2015) using the revised universal soil loss equation
   (RUSLE) and geographical information systems (GIS). The components of
   RUSLE such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope-length
   and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P)
   factors were grouped into two categories by keeping one set as
   temporally changing and others as static. Among them the R and C factors
   are calculated for the years 1991, 2001 and 2015 whereas the K and LS
   factors are considered for the single time frame. Because of the
   forested nature of the study area, the P factor is kept constant for the
   whole analysis. The R factor and C factor is shown changes in values and
   its distribution over the years, which reflected in the final soil loss
   and erosion vulnerability map as a change in the rate of erosion and
   spatial domain. The analysis of three time slices has shown that the
   maximum value of the soil loss per unit area i.e. at erosion hotspots,
   is relatively similar throughout at around 1636 to 1744 t/ha/y. This is
   the result of maximum values of R factor and C factor i.e. high rainfall
   erosivity combined with lack of vegetation cover in those hotspots,
   which are generally steeply sloping terrain. The reclassification of
   annual soil loss map into erosion vulnerability zones indicated a major
   increase in the spatial spread of erosion vulnerability from the year
   1991 to 2015 with a significant increase in the high and critical
   erosion areas from 2.3\% (1991) to 31.5\% (2015). In 1991, over 84\% of
   the study area was under low erosion vulnerability class but by the year
   2015 only 12\% was under low erosion vulnerability class. Moreover, a
   dynamic nature in the erosion pattern was found from the year 1991 to
   2015 with more linear areas of land associated with higher rate of soil
   loss and enhanced erosion vulnerability. The linearity in the spatial
   pattern is correlated with the development of logging roads and logging
   activities which has been confirmed by the extraction of exposed areas
   from satellite images of different years of analysis. The findings of
   the present study has quantified the changes in vegetation cover from
   dense, thick tropical forest to open mixed type landscapes which provide
   less protection against erosion and soil loss during the severe rainfall
   events which are characteristic of this tropical region.},

Title = {Seasonal and Interannual Variability of Fronts and Their Impact on
   Chlorophyll-a in the Indonesian Seas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability of oceanic fronts in the Indonesian seas
   was investigated using high-resolution satellite observations. The study
   aimed to understand the underlying mechanism driving these fronts and
   their impact on chlorophyll-a variability. A high value of frontal
   probability was found near the coasts of major islands, exhibiting a
   distinct seasonal cycle with peaks occurrences during austral winter.
   The distribution variability of chlorophyll-a was generally consistent
   with the presence of active frontal zones, although a significantly
   positive relationship between fronts and chlorophyll-a was limited to
   only some specific areas, e.g., south Java Island and the Celebes Sea.
   Wind-driven upwelling played a major role in front generation in the
   Java upwelling region and enhanced frontal activity can promote the
   growth of phytoplankton, leading to higher chlorophyll-a. Furthermore,
   the study demonstrated that wind patterns preceded variations in front
   probability and chlorophyll-a by approximately two months. This lag
   suggests that the spatiotemporal variability of fronts and chlorophyll-a
   in this region is primarily influenced by the monsoon system. In
   addition, the sea surface temperature (SST) simultaneously modulated the
   chlorophyll-a variability. Negative SST anomalies were typically
   associated with positive anomalies in front probability the
   chlorophyll-a in most areas. Notably, the interannual variability of
   fronts and chlorophyll-a are prominent in the Java upwelling region.
   During El Nino years, this region experienced an enhanced monsoon,
   resulting in a negative SST anomaly alongside positive anomalies in
   front probability and chlorophyll-a. A comprehensive description and
   underlying dynamics of frontal activity in the Indonesian seas are
   provided by this study. The findings are helpful to delineate the
   variability in chlorophyll-a, thereby facilitating the future
   understanding of local primary production and the carbon cycle.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As typical mesoscale processes, oceanic fronts
   have significant impacts on biological processes and fisheries in
   marginal seas. The complex spatiotemporal variability of fronts and
   their effects on biological processes in the Indonesian seas remain
   poorly understood. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap by
   investigating the seasonal and interannual variability of fronts and
   their influence on chlorophyll-a, a key indicator of phytoplankton
   biomass and primary productivity. The study identified a high frontal
   probability in south Java Island during austral winter and El Nino
   years. Wind-driven upwelling was found to be a major factor in front
   generation and promoting phytoplankton growth. The findings of this
   study will improve the theoretical knowledge of regional dynamics, local
   primary production, and the carbon cycle in the Indonesian seas,
   benefiting fisheries management and ecosystem conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {For much of the last two decades, the Central and East European (CEE)
   economies have experienced a deep structural reform, moving away from a
   socialist economic system towards a market economy. The political
   situation of the second half of the 20th century had a significant
   impact on the economic development and competitiveness of these
   transition countries, when compared with their Western European
   counterparts. A vast number of studies have been conducted to analyze
   the structural changes required for resource-dependent economies to
   achieve long-term development and to understand the synergies between
   commodities and diversification. Yet, the dynamics of resource
   extraction and the resource dependence of regions that have experienced
   periods of sustained levels of growth have largely been overlooked,
   especially the Central and Eastern European region. In this context,
   this article presents an analysis of the level of resource dependence of
   six countries which joined the European Union between 2004 and 2007.
   Using data spanning from the year 2000 to 2017, we calculate the
   Extractives Dependence Index (EDI) of six former Soviet satellite
   nations and one former Soviet state. Our results indicate that the
   commodity structure of trade in the six countries which joined the
   European Union has changed considerably. These countries have reduced
   their economic dependence on extractive resources by developing their
   high value-added and technology-intensive sectors. Our findings also
   reveal that Poland experienced the highest decrease in EDI scores among
   the six CEE countries.},

Title = {Advancements in Imaging Technology: Do They (or Will They) Equate to

Abstract = {It is generally accepted that up to 50\% of those with a whiplash injury
   following a motor vehicle collision will fail to fully recover.
   Twenty-five percent of these patients will demonstrate a markedly
   complex clinical picture that includes severe pain-related disability,
   sensory and motor disturbances, and psychological distress. A number of
   psychosocial factors have shown prognostic value for recovery following
   whiplash from a motor vehicle collision. To date, no management approach
   (eg, physical therapies, education, psychological interventions, or
   interdisciplinary strategies) for acute whiplash has positively
   influenced recovery rates. For many of the probable pathoanatomical
   lesions (eg, fracture, ligamentous rupture, disc injury), there remains
   a lack of available clinical tests for identifying their Presence.
   Fractures, particularly at the craniovertebral and cervicothoracic
   junctions, may be radiographically occult. While high-resolution
   computed tomography scans can detect fractures, there remains a lack of
   prevalence data for fractures in this population. Conventional magnetic
   resonance imaging has not consistently revealed lesions in patients with
   acute or chronic whiplash, a ``failure{''} that may be due to
   limitations in the resolution of available devices and the use of
   standard sequences. The technological evolution of imaging techniques
   and sequences eventually might provide greater resolution to reveal
   currently elusive anatomical lesions (or, perhaps more importantly,
   temporal changes in physiological responses to assumed lesions) in those
   patients at risk of poor recovery. Preliminary findings from 2
   prospective cohort studies in 2 different countries suggest that this is
   so, as evidenced by changes to the structure of skeletal muscles in
   those who do not fully recover. In this clinical commentary, we will
   briefly introduce the available imaging decision rules and the current
   knowledge underlying the pathomechanics and pathophysiology of whiplash.
   We will then acknowledge known prognostic factors underlying functional
   recovery. Last, we will highlight emerging evidence regarding the
   pathobiology of muscle degeneration/regeneration, as well as
   advancements in neuroimaging and musculoskeletal imaging techniques (eg,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetization transfer imaging,
   spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging) that may be used as
   noninvasive and objective complements to known prognostic factors
   associated with whiplash recovery, in particular, poor functional
   recovery.},

Title = {Species-related single dead tree detection using multi-temporal ALS data
   and CIR imagery},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {219},

Abstract = {The assessment of the health conditions of trees in forests is extremely
   important for biodiversity, forest management, global environment
   monitoring, and carbon dynamics. There is a vast amount of research
   using remote sensing (RS) techniques for the assessment of the current
   condition of a forest, but only a small number of these are concerned
   with detection and classification of dead trees. Among the available RS
   techniques, only the airborne laser scanner (ALS) enables dead tree
   detection at the single tree level with high accuracy.
   The main objective of the study was to identify spruce, pine and
   deciduous trees by alive or dead classifications. Three RS data sets
   including ALS (leaf-on and leaf-off) and color-infrared (CIR) imagery
   (leaf-on) were used for the study. We used intensity and structural
   variables from the ALS data and spectral information derived from aerial
   imagery for the classification procedure. Additionally, we tested the
   differences in the classification accuracy of all variants contained in
   the data integration. In the study, the random forest (RF) classifier
   was used. The study was carried out in the Polish part of the Bialowieia
   Forest (BF).
   In general, we can state that all classifications, with different
   combinations of ALS features and CIR, resulted in high overall accuracy
   (OA >= 90\%) and Kappa (kappa > 0.86). For the best variant
   (CIR\_ALS(WSn-FH)), the mean values of overall accuracy and Kappa were
   equal to 94.3\% and 0.93, respectively. The leaf -on point cloud
   features alone produced the lowest accuracies (OA = 75-81\% and x =
   0.68-0.76). Improvements of 0-0.04 in the Kappa coefficient and 0-3.1\%
   in the overall classification accuracy were found after the point cloud
   normalization for all variants. Full -height point cloud features (F)
   produced lower accuracies than the results based on features calculated
   for half of the tree height point clouds (H) and combined FH.
   The importance of each of the predictors for different data sets for
   tree species classification provided by the RF algorithm was
   investigated. The lists of top features were the same, independent of
   intensity normalization. For the classification based on both of the
   point clouds (leaf on and leaf-off), three structural features (a
   proportion of first returns for both half -height and full -height
   variants and the canopy relief ratio of points) and two intensity
   features from first returns and half -height variant (the coefficient of
   variation and skewness) were rated as the most important. In the
   classification based on the point cloud with CIR features, two image
   features were among the most important (the NDVI and mean value of
   reflectance in the green band).},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well
   documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern
   depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This
   first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species
   richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups
   in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal
   variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index
   (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each
   vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations
   in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination
   method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25
   each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season
   respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during
   2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed
   that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1.
   Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2.
   Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus
   Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or
   CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the
   majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The
   majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas
   therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the
   most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were
   recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher
   mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields,
   suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical
   correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local
   climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most
   important in controlling the variations in the weed species data
   followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI
   and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are
   required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area.
   Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their
   distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing,
   quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and
   intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity,
   quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing,
   quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their
   relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are
   recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {An extensive literature review on clinical trials and economic studies
   published on the use of IFN-alpha as adjuvant therapy in stage II - III
   (AJCC 1992) malignant melanoma was performed. Large clinical trials with
   sufficient follow-up were selected to assess the efficacy.
   Medico-economic studies, based on the results of several of these
   trials, were analysed to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratios of IFN
   in this disease. IFN-alpha demonstrated efficacy as adjuvant therapy in
   malignant melanoma with high-dose regimens in patients with overt
   regional nodal disease (so-called high-risk patients) and with low-dose
   regimens in stage IIA and -B patients without clinically detectable
   nodes (so-called intermediate risk patients). This efficacy was
   associated with high rates of severe side effects using a high-dose
   regimen. Based on these assumptions, economic analyses performed in
   different settings and using several methods to extrapolate clinical
   results are producing similar results of extra costs for IFN associated
   with a medical benefit. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios provided
   are (< US\$50,000 per life year gained) in the range of current and
   widely used medical strategies in different diseases and settings. This
   should allow the recommendation of the use of IFN-a therapy in malignant
   melanoma, using high doses in high-risk patients and low doses in
   intermediate-risk patients. In the final decision of whether or not to
   treat, however, the patient has to be informed that IFN will probably
   only delay events, with the possibility of any curative effect being
   uncertain. This limited effect has to be balanced with the severe impact
   on quality of life of high-dose regimen and with the fact that many
   patients in whom low doses are indicated would not recur in the absence
   of treatment. It is also clear that patients with only a positive
   sentinel node are to be considered with the intermediate risk group in
   which they were evaluated.},

   ophthalmologists, raising concerns regarding the influence of
   pharmaceutical companies on the choice of medication by a relatively
   small group of clinicians. One approach to protect patients' health care
   interests is to include them in deliberations on the choice of therapy
   for their eye disease.
   Objective To examine factors associated with patients' choice between an
   effective and less expensive off-label drug or a more effective, but
   also more expensive, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
   drug.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort analysis
   used data from the satellite office of a tertiary referral center from
   August 2, 2013, to April 9, 2018. Insured patients initiating treatment
   with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor were included in the
   analysis. Data were analyzed from March 26, 2018, to June 10, 2020.
   Interventions Patients were asked to choose between bevacizumab
   (approximately \$100 per dose), a chemotherapy that is effective, but
   not FDA approved, for the treatment of ocular vascular disease, or
   aflibercept (approximately \$2000 per dose), an FDA-approved drug for
   ocular vascular disease that may be more effective than bevacizumab in
   some patients. Independent of this choice, patients were separately
   asked by a study coordinator to participate in an invasive clinical
   study for which they would not be compensated, there was a small risk
   for an adverse event, and they would not personally benefit from
   participating (a surrogate marker for altruism).
   Main Outcomes and Measures Factors associated with patients' choice of
   medication, including age, sex, ocular disease, race, and participation
   in an invasive clinical study.
   Results A total of 189 patients were included in the analysis (106 women
   {[}56\%]; mean {[}SEM] age, 74.6 {[}0.8] years). Despite being told that
   it may not be as effective as aflibercept, 100 patients (53\%) selected
   bevacizumab for their own eye care. An act of altruism (ie,
   participation in an invasive clinical study) when the patient was making
   a choice between the 2 drugs was associated with a patient's choice of
   bevacizumab (odds ratio {[}OR], 7.03; 95\% CI, 2.27-21.80; P < .001);
   the OR for selecting bevacizumab for patients who never agreed to
   participate in the clinical study was 0.45 (95\% CI, 0.25-0.83; P =
   .001). Age (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.03; P = .86), race (OR, 0.70; 95\%
   CI, 0.41-1.22; P = .21), sex (OR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.39-1.35; P = .31),
   presence of diabetes (OR, 1.52; 95\% CI, 0.59-3.93; P = .39), and type
   of eye disease (OR, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.30-1.04; P = .07) were not
   associated with choice of therapy.
   Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that clinicians must
   consider the ethical implications of the influence of altruism when
   patients participate in the decision between cost-effective vs the most
   effective medicines for their own health care.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the topographic maps from 1933, 1951 and 1962 (sc 1:10
   000, 1:25 000 and 1:100 000, respectively) and the satellite image from
   2014 (sc 1:10 000), we determined changes in the channel of the small
   Brynica river (Southern Poland) as well as in the land-use pattern along
   this river valley after its melioration. Terrain regulation and drainage
   brought about an intensification of the overland runoff, and a decrease
   in irrigation of the territory. Due to soil overdrying, some tracts of
   the valley are experiencing a moisture deficiency. Peat drying can lead
   to negative consequences, because shallow peats mostly occur on the
   study territory. Disappearance of peaty soils acts to decrease the
   degree of suitability of the riverside territories for economic purposes
   as well as their capacity for recovery. The schematic map of vegetation
   distribution along the river valley prior to and after melioration as
   compiled from results of field observations displays differences between
   mosaic quasi-natural vegetation and areas of typical agrocenoses. The
   preservation of the natural values along the Brynica valley is possible
   through balanced economic management, while the differentiation of
   topography contributes to creating favorable conditions for the
   formation of biodiversity.},

Title = {Has Current French Training for Military Orthopedic Surgeons Deployed in
   External Operations Been Appropriately Adapted?},
Journal = {MILITARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {183},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {E411-E415},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction: The current evolution of surgical practices is
   increasingly trending toward hyper-specialization. For military
   surgeons, their practice in France does not differ from their civilian
   counterparts. In contrast, in external operations, they have to deal
   with specific war injuries in austere conditions. They are also required
   to take care of local populations. Therefore, specific training is
   necessary, and the French Military Health Service Academy (Ecole du
   Val-de-Grace) Paris has set up a specific training called Advanced
   Course for Deployment Surgery (ACDS) in 2007. The aim of this study is
   to assess the relevance of this teaching regarding pathologies
   encountered during current conflicts. Materials and Methods: The
   activity of deploying orthopedic surgeons during the three recent major
   external operations (Afghanistan, Mali, and Central African Republic)
   has been retrospectively recorded in terms of global volume, types of
   trauma, status of patients who had been operated on, and indications.
   These data have been compared with teaching during the ACDS. Results:
   Our study found a high variability in terms of operating volume, types
   of trauma, patients' statuses, and types of operations performed
   depending on the operation theaters. The volume of surgical activity
   carried out within Role 3 is much more important than that in Role 2
   with more than half of the surgeries performed as scheduled surgery to
   the benefit of the local population. Within advanced Role 2 surgical
   structures deployed in Mali and Central Africa, more than 70\% of the
   activity was performed as emergencies. Surgical indications were varied,
   ranging from emergency surgery to limb reconstructive surgery. A lot of
   non-orthopedic procedures such as vascular repairs and decompressive
   craniotomies were also performed. All of the encountered pathologies
   were taught during ACDS. Discussion: The large variety and technical
   nature of the performed operations requires the training of highly
   qualified military orthopedic surgeons with both experience in war
   surgery and management of after-effects and complications. Orthopedists
   are also required to carry out procedures dealing with neurosurgery,
   general, and/or vascular surgery on missions. These data highlight the
   complexity of military surgeons' training along with the
   hyper-specialization of the civilian medical world. For more than 10 yr,
   French military surgeons have benefited from a training program called
   ACDS to meet these objectives. This initial training seems to be
   appropriated adapted in view of the managed pathologies.},

Abstract = {Late-glacial and Iron-Age open-air rock art of the Coa River Valley
   shows a similar spatial distribution, with several clusters along the
   Coa and Douro River tributaries that are mostly exposed to the
   southeast. In this report, we try to determine whether the artists of
   both periods deliberately chose the same natural panels for rock art or
   its present-day spatial distribution is imposed by formation and
   weathering processes, previous or subsequent to the engraving.
   Geological structural analysis, from regional to field scales, shows a
   NNE-SSW sinistral strike-slip fault system that crosses the study area,
   together with a set of fracture/joints with the same orientation and
   formed by the same tectonic stress. Direct field measurement and the
   description of 713 natural panels, engraved and un-engraved, reveal that
   the preserved rock art panels correspond to the most common tectonic
   fracture/joint systems (NNE-SSW) of the study area. Locally, the
   hydrographic network is conditioned by the same structural control.
   Differential weathering exists between the panels exposed on opposite
   margins of watercourses, with preferential degradation of the rock art
   panel surfaces exposed to the NW. We propose that, on the scale of the
   valley, the surface weathering of the rock art panels results from
   differential solar radiation, humidity, lichen and bryophyte
   colonisations. Interpretation of field observations, a
   frequency-probabilistic procedure, pair-wise comparison matrix and
   geographic information system analysis were combined to evaluate a Coa
   panel formation and preservation predictive model using archaeological,
   topographical and hydrological data. Four variables were extracted and
   weighted from the collected data, including topographic slope and
   aspect, solar radiation and cost-weighted distance to watercourses,
   which were used as environmental input data. The archaeological input
   data (rock art occurrences) were used to calculate the variable ratings
   and to evaluate both the Coa panel formation and preservation predictive
   model and external validation maps, with the results showing an
   agreement of 80\% and 70\%, respectively. Field verification revealed
   unknown rock art panels in areas with high and very high values. The Coa
   panel formation and preservation predictive model provides a useful
   framework to guide survey and heritage management. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {A soil colour map of China},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {379},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Soil colour can indicate soil physical, chemical and biological
   properties and processes, and is an important indicator for soil
   classification, soil quality evaluation and soil management. It varies
   in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, and thus regional maps of
   soil colour can reveal spatial patterns of these properties, processes,
   and indicators. However, although soil regions are sometimes named for
   their dominant soil colour, it is directly measured only at ``point{''}
   support, i.e., during soil profile description, whereas it is desirable
   to know soil colour over the entire soilscape. To achieve this for China
   we used predictive soil mapping methods to produce soil colour maps (dry
   and moist colours) at 1 km(2) grid cell size and over multiple depths
   from a consistent dataset of approximately 4 600 full profile
   descriptions taken as part of a national survey to define soil series in
   Chinese Soil Taxonomy, and a set of environmental covariates covering
   the national territory. The covariates characterized soil forming
   factors including climate, parent materials, terrain, vegetation, land
   surface water and thermal conditions. Soil colour descriptions in the
   Munsell system were extracted from the genetic horizon descriptions at
   the selected depths and converted to the sRGB and L{*}a{*}b{*} colour
   spaces. Dry and moist colour separates were not well-correlated in
   either space (r < 0.76). Random forest models were constructed in both
   spaces, for dry and moist colours separately. Models in sRGB space were
   moderately successful (R-2 approximate to 0.43, RMSE approximate to
   26/255) at 5 cm, with success decreasing with depth. Models smoothed the
   colour space and thus did not predict the more extreme values or
   chromas, nor the rarer hues. Models in L{*}a{*}b{*} space were less
   successful. The fitted sRGB models were used to produce predictive maps
   over all of China. Regional patterns as well as local detail are clearly
   shown. Solar radiation, wind exposure, regolith thickness, and Landsat
   TM bands 7 and 5 contributed most to the predictions, followed by
   elevation, mean annual precipitation, terrain wetness index, air
   temperature seasonality, precipitation standard deviation and standard
   deviation of NDVI. These suggest pedological processes acting on the
   development of soil colours, including weathering of parent materials,
   oxidation-reduction chemistry and biochemistry of the decomposing of
   organic matter. This study shows that predictive methods from points
   using suitable covariates are an alternative to spatial predictions over
   map units from their representative profiles.},

Title = {Impact of information technology on the earth sciences},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Abstract = {The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with
   the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal
   plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight
   quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and
   geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to
   construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front
   the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the
   controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly
   the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the
   building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data
   gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example,
   digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the
   earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the
   earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly
   available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to
   propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into
   a new era. The component information technologies are now available to
   allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world.
   Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques
   have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's
   crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved
   pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas
   reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at
   best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this,
   geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow
   through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic
   reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir
   and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made
   about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is
   analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques
   means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences
   yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in
   understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers
   which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake
   belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems
   within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their
   colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is
   such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone.
   Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies
   will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The
   key components of the information technologies that will enable this
   revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and
   computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components
   needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from
   observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making.
   Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic
   sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within
   the earth.
   Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can
   be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful
   information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this
   particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir
   through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil.
   The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through
   the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed.
   From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior
   of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists
   and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to
   various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and
   manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being
   developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data
   overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data.
   Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by
   data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is
   probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age.
   Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which
   by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to
   picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously,
   the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple
   two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing
   rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated,
   and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff
   the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many
   complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of
   complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments
   conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to
   project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special
   glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a
   three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are
   already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly
   with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and
   workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies
   and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the
   application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the
   generalist. This is a very important development because it allows
   models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights
   and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the
   specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily
   available technology. Application of this entire suite of information
   technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced
   processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete
   cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and
   improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory
   to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a
   major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the
   value of their application and integration with other technical
   disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely
   not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic
   prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from
   companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of
   the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Title = {Observed Changes in Crop Yield Associated with Droughts Propagation via
   Natural and Human-Disturbed Agro-Ecological Zones of Pakistan},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Pakistan's agriculture and food production account for 27\% of its
   overall gross domestic product (GDP). Despite ongoing advances in
   technology and crop varieties, an imbalance between water availability
   and demand, combined with robust shifts in drought propagation has
   negatively affected the agro-ecosystem and environmental conditions. In
   this study, we examined hydro-meteorological drought propagation and its
   associated impacts on crop yield across natural and human-disturbed
   agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Pakistan. Multisource datasets (i.e.,
   ground observations, reanalysis, and satellites) were used to
   characterize the most extensive, intense drought episodes from 1981 to
   2018 based on the standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI),
   standardized streamflow index (SSFI), standardized surface water storage
   index (SSWSI), and standardized groundwater storage index (SGWI). The
   most common and intense drought episodes characterized by SPEI, SSFI,
   SSWSI, and SGWI were observed in years 1981-1983, 2000-2003, 2005, and
   2018. SPEI yielded the maximum number of drought months (90) followed by
   SSFI (85), SSWSI (75), and SGWI (35). Droughts were frequently longer
   and had a slower termination rate in the human-disturbed AEZs (e.g.,
   North Irrigated Plain and South Irrigated Plain) compared to natural
   zones (e.g., Wet Mountains and Northern Dry Mountains). The historical
   droughts are likely caused by the anomalous large-scale patterns of
   geopotential height, near-surface air temperature, total precipitation,
   and prevailing soil moisture conditions. The negative values (<-2) of
   standardized drought severity index (DSI) observed during the drought
   episodes (1988, 2000, and 2002) indicated a decline in vegetation growth
   and yield of major crops such as sugarcane, maize, wheat, cotton, and
   rice. A large number of low-yield years (SYRI <= -1.5) were recorded for
   sugarcane and maize (10 years), followed by rice (9 years), wheat (8
   years), and cotton (6 years). Maximum crop yield reductions relative to
   the historic mean (1981-2017) were recorded in 1983 (38\% for cotton),
   1985 (51\% for maize), 1999 (15\% for wheat), 2000 (29\% for cotton),
   2001 (37\% for rice), 2002 (21\% for rice), and 2004 (32\% for maize).
   The percentage yield losses associated with shifts in SSFI and SSWSI
   were greater than those in SPEI, likely due to longer drought
   termination duration and a slower termination rate in the
   human-disturbed AEZs. The study's findings will assist policymakers to
   adopt sustainable agricultural and water management practices, and make
   climate change adaptation plans to mitigate drought impacts in the study
   region.},

Title = {Claims for fertility interventions: a systematic assessment of
   statements on UK fertility centre websites},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Abstract = {Objectives: Fertility services in the UK are offered by over 200 Human
   Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)-registered NHS and private
   clinics. While in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection (ICSI) form part of the National Institute for Health and Care
   Excellence (NICE) guidance, many further interventions are offered. We
   aimed to record claims of benefit for interventions offered by fertility
   centres via information on the centres' websites and record what
   evidence was cited for these claims.
   Methods: We obtained from HFEA a list of all UK centres providing
   fertility treatments and examined their websites. We listed fertility
   interventions offered in addition to standard IVF and ICSI and recorded
   statements about interventions that claimed or implied improvements in
   fertility in healthy women. We recorded which claims were quantified,
   and the evidence cited in support of the claims. Two reviewers extracted
   data from websites. We accessed websites from 21 December 2015 to 31
   March 2016.
   Results: We found 233 websites for HFEA-registered fertility treatment
   centres, of which 152 (65\%) were excluded as duplicates or satellite
   centres, 2 were andrology clinics and 5 were unavailable or under
   construction websites. In total, 74 fertility centre websites,
   incorporating 1401 web pages, were examined for claims. We found 276
   claims of benefit relating to 41 different fertility interventions made
   by 60 of the 74 centres (median 3 per website; range 0 to 10).
   Quantification was given for 79 (29\%) of the claims. 16 published
   references were cited 21 times on 13 of the 74 websites.
   Conclusions: Many fertility centres in the UK offer a range of
   treatments in addition to standard IVF procedures, and for many of these
   interventions claims of benefit are made. In most cases, the claims are
   not quantified and evidence is not cited to support the claims. There is
   a need for more information on interventions to be made available by
   fertility centres, to support well-informed treatment decisions.},

Title = {Continuous Wavelet Analysis of Leaf Reflectance Improves Classification
   Accuracy of Mangrove Species},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Due to continuous degradation of mangrove forests, the accurate
   monitoring of spatial distribution and species composition of mangroves
   is essential for restoration, conservation and management of coastal
   ecosystems. With leaf hyperspectral reflectance, this study aimed to
   explore the potential of continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) combined with
   different sample subset partition (stratified random sampling (STRAT),
   Kennard-Stone sampling algorithm (KS), and sample subset partition based
   on joint X-Y distances (SPXY)) and feature extraction methods (principal
   component analysis (PCA), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and
   vegetation index (VI)) in mangrove species classification. A total of
   301 mangrove leaf samples with four species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera
   gymnorrhiza, Kandelia obovate and Aegiceras corniculatum) were collected
   across six different regions. The smoothed reflectance (Smth) and first
   derivative reflectance (Der) spectra were subjected to CWA using
   different wavelet scales, and a total of 270 random forest
   classification models were established and compared. Among the 120
   models with CWA of Smth, 88.3\% of models increased the overall accuracy
   (OA) values with an improvement of 0.2-28.6\% compared to the model with
   the Smth spectra; among the 120 models with CWA of Der, 25.8\% of models
   increased the OA values with an improvement of 0.1-11.4\% compared to
   the model with the Der spectra. The model with CWA of Der at the scale
   of 2(3) coupling with STRAT and SPA achieved the best classification
   result (OA = 98.0\%), while the best model with Smth and Der alone had
   OA values of 86.3\% and 93.0\%, respectively. Moreover, the models using
   STRAT outperformed those using KS and SPXY, and the models using PCA and
   SPA had better performances than those using VIs. We have concluded that
   CWA with suitable scales holds great potential in improving the
   classification accuracy of mangrove species, and that STRAT combined
   with the PCA or SPA method is also recommended to improve classification
   performance. These results may lay the foundation for further studies
   with UAV-acquired or satellite hyperspectral data, and the encouraging
   performance of CWA for mangrove species classification can also be
   extended to other plant species.},

Abstract = {In this paper let us examine the information flows between Earth's
   civilization and lunar settlements, founded in the 21st century and
   intended to grow productively thereafter. Information is the one
   valuable commodity instantly and cheaply transported between Earth and
   Moon, and so all kinds of tele-services are likely to flourish once
   lunar settlements exist. We shall consider them in the light of the
   symposium questions: new developments in tele-health and tele-education,
   new tele-services using space technology, organizational structures,
   legal and regulatory frameworks, new scientific foundations, benefits
   and dangers, and lessons to be learned. Some relevant activities need
   not wait for a decision to found lunar cities; they can start now
   because they have merit already, even before an extension of our global
   village to the Moon. ISU should play an important role in this
   development.
   We begin with a brief review of the natural limits controlling any kind
   of Earth-Moon communications, the main one being distance, ten times the
   range to geosynchronous orbit. Also, though Earth is nearly fixed in the
   sky as seen from the Moon, Earth's daily rotation dictates multiple
   ground stations, orbital relays, or both. For the wideband, multichannel
   information flows expected, optical links provide huge advantages and
   will undoubtedly be used. Maintaining a reliable service in the presence
   of the Earth's weather presents interesting technical and economic
   trade-offs whose solutions are likely to exist for other reasons long
   before they are needed for the lunar application.
   Next we examine likely types and rates of information flow, reasoning by
   analogy to what is already happening in intercity and international
   communications on Earth. Scientific, technical, business and
   entertainment communications, except those involving supercomputing,
   move at rates such that future radio and optical carriers will not
   constitute bottlenecks. However, the interconnections of those carriers,
   and particularly their costs and regulatory aspects, do limit services
   and so are drivers of technical, governmental, and economic change. The
   history of satellite relays and Internet growth is instructive, but it
   probably provides only a hint as to the complexity of the coming global
   village's nervous system. What does this mean with respect to lunar
   links? One obvious inference is that there will be a demand for
   enormously greater bandwidth, diversity and quality relative to the
   performance of the links used up to now for Apollo and other lunar
   missions, and used or planned for space stations. Going beyond technical
   matters, there is the question of privacy and control: already the
   Internet and many intranets are showing how controversial this can
   become. Once self-governing lunar settlements exist, similar problems
   are sure to arise.
   Finally, we propose one application of Earth-Moon-Earth communications
   that is important now, need not wait for humans to return to the Moon,
   and could contribute greatly to the quality and safety of a two-world
   global village. This is to begin building, on the Moon, a retrievable,
   polyglot robotic archive of accumulated human knowledge and wisdom. This
   paper gives reasons for such a project, addresses its risks and
   benefits, presents it as part of a natural evolution toward the
   information flows that lunar settlements will need, and suggests a role
   in it for the International Space University.},

Title = {Low efficiency of large volcanic eruptions in transporting very fine ash
   into the atmosphere},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Volcanic ash clouds are common, often unpredictable, phenomena generated
   during explosive eruptions. Mainly composed of very fine ash particles,
   they can be transported in the atmosphere at great distances from the
   source, having detrimental socio-economic impacts. However, proximal
   settling processes controlling the proportion (epsilon) of the very fine
   ash fraction distally transported in the atmosphere are still poorly
   understood. Yet, for the past two decades, some operational
   meteorological agencies have used a default value of epsilon = 5\% as
   input for forecast models of atmospheric ash cloud concentration. Here
   we show from combined satellite and field data of sustained eruptions
   that e actually varies by two orders of magnitude with respect to the
   mass eruption rate. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the most intense
   eruptions are in fact the least efficient (with epsilon = 0.1\%) in
   transporting very fine ash through the atmosphere. This implies that the
   amount of very fine ash distally transported in the atmosphere is up to
   50 times lower than previously anticipated. We explain this finding by
   the efficiency of collective particle settling in ash-rich clouds which
   enhance early and en masse fallout of very fine ash. This suggests that
   proximal sedimentation during powerful eruptions is more controlled by
   the concentration of ash than by the grain size. This has major
   consequences for decision-makers in charge of air traffic safety
   regulation, as well as for the understanding of proximal settling
   processes. Finally, we propose a new statistical model for predicting
   the source mass eruption rate with an unprecedentedly low level of
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Aviation operations, including navigation, surveillance and timing,
   increasingly rely on GNSS services. Concerning navigation, ICAO
   (International Civil Aviation Organization) has decided on the objective
   to move from operations based on ground radio navigation aids to GNSS
   based operations for all phases of flight. GNSS is already widely used
   for the cruise part of the flight and is being further developed for
   approach and landing operations. The surveillance domain follows the
   same trend. GNSS based services already enhance radar systems and an
   increasing part of the surveillance domain will partly rely on GNSS
   services in the coming years. GNSS performances under nominal ionosphere
   conditions are already well known. However, before moving towards these
   GNSS services, the aviation community has to better assess GNSS
   performances under abnormal ionosphere conditions.
   Adverse ionosphere conditions affect the GNSS signal travelling and can
   induce group delay, which will degrade the positioning performances, or
   scintillation, leading to loss the lock of one or more satellites within
   the GNSS receiver. The future use of multiple dual frequency GNSS
   constellation will significantly decrease the impact of these adverse
   ionosphere conditions. Indeed, the use of two frequencies will enable
   users to correct the group delay, and the higher number of satellites
   will efficiently mitigate the scintillation effect. Although dual
   frequency GPS and GALILEO satellite full operational constellation
   should be available by 2020+, it is most likely that the majority of the
   European aircraft fleet will not be equipped with dual frequency
   multiple constellation receivers before 2030. Therefore, the current
   2013 solar cycle is the best opportunity to scale the ionosphere impact
   and define adequate mitigations for the next 2024 solar cycle. As a
   consequence, in 2009 EUROCONTROL (European Organization for the Safety
   of Air Navigation) launched a project to assess the potential solar
   activity impact on European GNSS civil aviation operations and to
   identify technical or operational mitigation techniques
   Within the framework of this project, a network of approximately 250
   European GNSS ground stations is used to daily monitor the ionosphere.
   This monitoring consists of an automatic generation of several
   per-station-ionosphere parameters and European ionosphere maps. In
   addition, for some interesting ionosphere events, a manual analysis
   which further characterizes these events is performed. So far, 7 events
   in 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been analyzed. During some of these events,
   ionosphere slant spatial gradients up to 160 mm/Km have been measured
   over the Canary Islands. European ionosphere scenarios have been built
   based on the characterization of these ionosphere events associated with
   past events characterized by other studies during the previous solar
   cycle. These scenarios are a set of maximum values for different
   ionosphere parameters related to the Total Electron Content (TEC) but
   also to scintillations. They consider both significant and worst case
   ionosphere events and they have been split into geographical regions. A
   total of 6 scenarios have been defined. At first, those scenarios have
   been input into a GNSS receiver simulator to assess the ionosphere
   impact at receiver level. Two receivers reflecting current aeronautical
   ABAS receivers have been simulated. The output is an impact assessment
   at receiver level in terms of pseudo-range error, tracking robustness
   and re-acquisition performance for different elevation angles. Then,
   based on the receiver behaviour results, the same ionosphere scenarios
   have been implemented into a service volume simulator. This service
   volume simulator has been based on the PEGASUS software developed by
   EUROCONTROL for the GNSS community. This service volume simulator has
   been used to assess the ionosphere impact at operation level by
   characterizing the accuracy, integrity and availability of the intended
   application. ICAO standards as well as equipment standards are used as
   reference for the application performance requirements.},

Title = {3D-VAR Data Assimilation of SEVIRI Radiances for the Prediction of Solar

Abstract = {Solar power generation is highly fluctuating due to its dependence on
   atmospheric conditions. The integration of this variable resource into
   the energy supply system requires reliable predictions of the expected
   power production as a basis for management and operation strategies.
   This is one of the goals of the Solar Cloud project, funded by the
   Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE)-to provide detailed
   forecasts of solar irradiance variables to operators and organizations
   operating in the solar energy industry. The Institute of Methodologies
   for Environmental Analysis of the National Research Council (IMAA-CNR),
   participating to the project, implemented an operational chain that
   provides forecasts of all the solar irradiance variables at high
   temporal and horizontal resolution using the numerical weather
   prediction Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW)
   Solar version 3.8.1 released by the National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCAR) in August 2016. With the aim of improving the forecast
   of solar irradiance, the three-dimensional (3D-Var) data assimilation
   was tested to assimilate radiances from the Spinning Enhanced Visible
   and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)
   geostationary satellite into WRF Solar. To quantify the impact, the
   model output is compared against observational data. Hourly Global
   Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is compared with ground-based observations
   from Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment (ARPA) and
   with MSG Shortwave Solar Irradiance estimations, while WRF Solar cloud
   coverage is compared with Cloud Mask by MSG. A preliminary test has been
   performed in clear sky conditions to assess the capability of the model
   to reproduce the diurnal cycle of the solar irradiance. The statistical
   scores for clear sky conditions show a positive performance of the model
   with values comparable to the instrument uncertainty and a correlation
   of 0.995. For cloudy sky, the solar irradiance and the cloud cover are
   better simulated when the SEVIRI radiances are assimilated, especially
   in the short range of the simulation. For the cloud cover, the Mean Bias
   Error one hour after the assimilation time is reduced from 41.62 to
   20.29 W/m(2) when the assimilation is activated. Although only two case
   studies are considered here, the results indicate that the assimilation
   of SEVIRI radiance improves the performance of WRF Solar especially in
   the first 3 hour forecast.},

   Based on Fuzzy Fokker Planck Solution},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {80764-80783},
Abstract = {Production of clean, green solar PV (SPV) power in developing countries
   now becomes a trend because of their economic and technical benefits.
   Therefore, generating maximum power out of the SPV is a key searchable
   area. The SPV must produce power at its terminal at their maximum
   possible power. To reach to the maximum possible power, maximum power
   point tracker(MPPT) is used in conjunction with SPV. Extracting maximum
   power from SPV under varying partial shading condition is one of the
   important factor in performance improvement of SPV. The characteristics
   of classical MPPT controller is not acceptable under variable shading
   condition. A clear distinction between global maxima power point from
   global minima using MPPT technique must be needed for extracting maximum
   power. This paper proposes a P\&O MPPT based particle swarm optimization
   with improved search space, optimised through Fuzzy Fokker Planck
   solution. The pre-defined search space has been introduced to provide
   fine tune to membership function used in Fuzzy logic controller. The
   partial shading performance has been examined under four different
   condition such as active partial shading, colour spectrum, dust level
   and green house gas (GHG) concentration. Both hardware and simulation
   studies has been carried out for the proposed techniques. The MATLAB
   simulation result and that of proposed MPPT, offer more and better
   performance in terms of algorithm convergence by enhancing the
   efficiency of system under varying shading condition.},

Title = {An optimisation model for incentivising the development of marginal oil
   and gas fields amidst increasingly complex ownership patterns: UKCS case
   study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many recent discoveries in the UKCS have been economically marginal and
   comparatively small such that they are unable to be developed on a
   standalone basis. Nevertheless, there is a proliferation of production
   facilities and transport infrastructure that can, on accepting a tariff,
   process hydrocarbons from these smaller-sized oil and gas fields,
   thereby contributing to the UK Government's strategy of maximising
   economic recovery (MER). However, the empirical dimensions of
   cost-sharing arrangements between a field owner (host field or hub) and
   tie-in (satellite) fields are not well examined in the literature
   although they influence long-term economics in matured oil provinces. In
   this paper, we develop a mixed integer programming optimisation model to
   analyse how these third-party access to infrastructure issues impact MER
   in the UKCS. A first-best situation with only one regional operator is
   empirically compared with the actual situation of multiple ownership. We
   then assess the impact of different infrastructure unbundling provisions
   via pipeline tariff choices and their interaction with the fiscal regime
   on the net present value (NPV) and other project metrics such as timings
   of hub and field shutdowns. We find that differences in field ownership,
   tariff choice and changes to the fiscal regime impact the overall NPV of
   field developments. Our results also show that having a progressive
   fiscal regime in a mature basin such as the UKCS is important to support
   continued operations under low oil prices while increasing the
   government's take at high prices. The cost-sharing effect shows that
   imposing strict cost-sharing rules does not change overall project
   valuations, even in a low oil price scenario. An additional contribution
   to the extant literature is that tariff determination could be based on
   cost-sharing rules that enjoin each field tieback to a hub to pay a
   split tariff, comprised of a fixed cost of service (access charge) and
   variable (marginal) costs.},

Title = {A Review of User Perceptions of Drought Indices and Indicators Used in
   the Diverse Climates of North America},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Drought monitoring and early detection have improved greatly in recent
   decades through the development and refinement of numerous indices and
   indicators. However, a lack of guidance, based on user experience,
   exists as to which drought-monitoring tools are most appropriate in a
   given location. This review paper summarizes the results of targeted
   user engagement and the published literature to improve the
   understanding of drought across North America and to enhance the utility
   of drought-monitoring tools. Workshops and surveys were used to assess
   and make general conclusions about the perceived performance of drought
   indicators, indices and impact information used for monitoring drought
   in the five main Koppen climate types (Tropical, Temperate, Continental,
   Polar Tundra, Dry) found across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
   In Tropical, humid Temperate, and southerly Continental climates,
   droughts are perceived to be more short-term (less than 6 months) in
   duration rather than long-term (more than 6 months). In Polar Tundra
   climates, Dry climates, Temperate climates with dry warm seasons, and
   northerly Continental climates, droughts are perceived to be more
   long-term than short-term. In general, agricultural and hydrological
   droughts were considered to be the most important drought types. Drought
   impacts related to agriculture, water supply, ecosystem, and human
   health were rated to be of greatest importance. Users identified the
   most effective indices and indicators for monitoring drought across
   North America to be the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) and Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) (or another measure of precipitation anomaly),
   followed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (or
   another satellite-observed vegetation index), temperature anomalies,
   crop status, soil moisture, streamflow, reservoir storage, water use
   (demand), and reported drought impacts. Users also noted the importance
   of indices that measure evapotranspiration, evaporative demand, and snow
   water content. Drought indices and indicators were generally thought to
   perform equally well across seasons in Tropical and colder Continental
   climates, but their performance was perceived to vary seasonally in Dry,
   Temperate, Polar Tundra, and warmer Continental climates, with improved
   performance during warm and wet times of the year. The drought indices
   and indicators, in general, were not perceived to perform equally well
   across geographies. This review paper provides guidance on when (time of
   year) and where (climate zone) the more popular drought indices and
   indicators should be used. The paper concludes by noting the importance
   of understanding how drought, its impacts, and its indicators are
   changing over time as the climate warms and by recommending ways to
   strengthen the use of indices and indicators in drought decision making.},

Title = {From grapes to getaways: Unraveling the residential tourism impact on
   land use change and soil erosion processes in Menfi district},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {137},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean basin has experienced widespread changes in land use
   and, along with this, changes in geomorphological and hydrological
   processes and erosion risks. The Menfi area (Italy) has been no
   exception, and residential tourism has played an unexplored role. Using
   satellite images in 2007 and 2022, the main changes in land use were
   determined comparatively, and the variation in soil erosion levels was
   calculated using the RUSLE equation. The contribution of residential
   tourism to these processes was also analyzed. The results show a
   substantial decrease in the area occupied by vineyards and a increase in
   the site devoted to residential tourism (second homes) with olive
   orchards. Erosion values have also decreased. The results allow us to
   conclude that the decrease in the area with vineyards results in a
   reduction in soil erosion. The main drivers of the change in land use
   are socioeconomic factors, including the aging of farmers, the shift of
   subsequent generations to alternative activities, and the overall
   decrease in agricultural income. In addition, the expansion of tourist
   infrastructure was accentuated in the new land with olive orchard groves
   in south-faced, medium-altitude, and lower slope areas, which together
   provide landscape value and contribute to the reduction of soil erosion.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {324-325},

Abstract = {One problem during offshore well-test operations, stimulations, and
   routine workovers are discharges into the air and sea while flaring.
   These procedures are usually performed by mobile drilling rigs with no
   storage capacity, and thus, hydrocarbons sequestered must be burned off
   from the rig flare booms. Another major problem has been the inability
   of the flare to operate at high flow rates. Because the burning process
   slows the pace of a test, restricting full flow testing, valuable well
   information is lost. Flaring of hydrocarbons also represents an economic
   loss. In the case of oil rigs, for example, flaring not only emits CO2
   into the atmosphere but also burns off usable oil.
   The Crystal Sea well-test vessel was designed to address the problems
   inherent to flaring and, at the same time, provide cost efficiency by
   salvaging usable oil during well testing. The success of her initial two
   jobs on the Statfjord North satellite field in the Norwegian sector of
   the North Sea confirms that sale of the salvaged oil normally lost
   during the flaring process could generate sufficient economic return to
   pay for the vessel. In addition, with its capability to receive products
   at twice the flow rate of conventional methods, the increased accuracy
   of the technical information obtained from the well test further
   enhances its value for improved reservoir management.},

Title = {The economics of fishing the high seas},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While the ecological impacts of fishing the waters beyond national
   jurisdiction (the ``high seas{''}) have been widely studied, the
   economic rationale is more difficult to ascertain because of scarce data
   on the costs and revenues of the fleets that fish there. Newly compiled
   satellite data and machine learning now allow us to track individual
   fishing vessels on the high seas in near real time. These technological
   advances help us quantify high-seas fishing effort, costs, and benefits,
   and assess whether, where, and when high-seas fishing makes economic
   sense. We characterize the global high-seas fishing fleet and report the
   economic benefits of fishing the high seas globally, nationally, and at
   the scale of individual fleets. Our results suggest that fishing at the
   current scale is enabled by large government subsidies, without which as
   much as 54\% of the present high-seas fishing grounds would be
   unprofitable at current fishing rates. The patterns of fishing
   profitability vary widely between countries, types of fishing, and
   distance to port. Deep-sea bottom trawling often produces net economic
   benefits only thanks to subsidies, and much fishing by the world's
   largest fishing fleets would largely be unprofitable without subsidies
   and low labor costs. These results support recent calls for subsidy and
   fishery management reforms on the high seas.},

Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) have gained importance due to
   their widespread distribution, their host range and damage potential
   (Hussey \& Janssen, 2002). A recent survey on root-knot nematodes in
   Europe by Wesemael et al. (2011) showed that out of the 90 species
   described so far, 23 have been found in Europe. Furthermore, this survey
   showed that three species, namely Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and
   M. javanica, are the most prevalent in southern European countries and
   in protected cultivation systems in the northern parts of Europe. These
   species can cause significant economic losses due to yield and quality
   reduction on high value crops. Rootknot nematode species are normally
   identified using morphological features and morphometrics on
   second-stage juveniles (J2), males, on the perineal patterns of mature
   females or isozyme phenotyping of females (Hunt \& Handoo, 2009). As the
   J2 stage is readily available from soil, and identifying this stage is
   most useful for making appropriate management decisions, several
   molecular methods, such as the use of restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms (RFLP), satellite DNA probes, sequence characterised
   amplified regions (SCAR) and real-time PCR assays, have become the
   preferred method for identification (Blok \& Powers, 2009). However, few
   of these methods enable the simultaneous identification of several
   nematode species within one sample.},

Abstract = {For thousands of years edacho Kue (Artillery Lake, Northwest
   Territories) has been a key water crossing site for barren-ground
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). Human disturbance of
   barren-ground caribou habitat in northern Canada has emerged as an
   important focus of study in the last decade; particularly in the
   Bathurst range of the Northwest Territories where caribou populations
   have declined by more than 95\% since the 1980s. Guided by local
   Indigenous leaders and Elders, a collaborative research project was
   developed with the Denesoline people of Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation
   (2012 - 14). This paper describes linkages between knowledge derived
   from Denesoline oral history and quantitative dendroecological analysis
   of trample scars on black spruce (Picea mariana) root samples collected
   at.edacho Kue to provide a better understanding of caribou use at this
   location. Findings from oral histories and dendroecology analysis were
   consistent with one another and with previous dendroecology study in the
   region, although some discrepancies were detected in data from 1995 -
   2006 that require further study to elucidate. Key findings include
   relatively low caribou use at.edacho Kue during the 1930s and late
   1960s, with use increasing into the 1970s and peaking in the late 1980s,
   as well as Elder and hunter reports of no caribou in some years between
   2005 and 2012. This work addresses a gap in scientific data about
   barren-ground caribou movements at.edacho Kue prior to satellite collar
   use in 1996 and corroborates previously documented oral histories about
   the enduring value of `edacho Kue as critical habitat to barren-ground
   caribou. Given the drastic decline of the Bathurst caribou over the last
   two decades, more research is needed to understand movements and their
   relationship to population dynamics. In this context, the research
   approach described in this paper could be used as an example of how to
   meaningfully bring together place-based Indigenous knowledge and science
   in addressing an urgent issue of Arctic sustainability.},

Abstract = {The geographic patterns of dentists have seldom been studied beyond very
   broad assessment. This article demonstrates, with location quotient and
   hot-spot analyses, the unevenness of general dentist and dental
   specialist resources throughout the Canadian province of Ontario and the
   presence of dental clusters within the metropolitan areas of Toronto,
   Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Windsor. While many municipalities in the
   province have no or relatively few dental offices, municipalities that
   are comparatively rich in both general and specialized dentists are rare
   and tend to be part of larger urban environments (typically census
   metropolitan areas), characterized by higher growth rates, higher median
   incomes, and lower median ages. Dentist office hot-spots within
   metropolitan areas occur in or near the downtown and in more
   peripheral/suburban locales. High sales dentist offices in suburban
   hot-spots appear to benefit from prosperous locations and supply
   deficits nearby, whereas inner-city dentist districts may form in part
   because of localization economies. Understanding where relative dentist
   under-supply occurs within a jurisdiction and why other locations are
   dentist-rich is important from a policy perspective so that geographic
   inequities, and associated spatial accessibility issues, can be more
   comprehensively appraised.

   Les profils geographiques des dentistes ont fait l'objet d'etudes qui,

   et specialistes dans la province canadienne de l'Ontario et de la
   presence de << grappes dentaires >> dans les regions metropolitaines de

Title = {Multi-decadal shoreline change in coastal natural world heritage sites -
   a global assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Natural World Heritage Sites (NWHS), which are of Outstanding Universal
   Value, are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic
   pressures. This is especially true for coastal NWHS, which are
   additionally subject to erosion and flooding. This paper assesses
   shoreline change from 1984 to 2016 within the boundaries of 67
   designated sites, providing a first global consistent assessment of its
   drivers. It develops a transferable methodology utilising new
   satellite-derived global shoreline datasets, which are classified based
   on linearity of change against time and compared with global datasets of
   geomorphology (topography, land cover, coastal type, and lithology),
   climate variability and sea-level change. Significant shoreline change
   is observed on 14\% of 52 coastal NWHS shorelines that show the largest
   recessional and accretive trends (means of -3.4 m yr(-1)and 3.5 m
   yr(-1), respectively). These rapid shoreline changes are found in
   low-lying shorelines (<1 m elevation) composed of unconsolidated
   sediments in vegetated tidal coastal systems (means of -7.7 m yr(-1)and
   12.5 m yr(-1)), and vegetated tidal deltas at the mouth of large river
   systems (means of -6.9 m yr(-1)and 11 m yr(-1)). Extreme shoreline
   changes occur as a result of redistribution of sediment driven by a
   combination of geomorphological conditions with (1) specific natural
   coastal morphodynamics such as opening of inlets (e.g.Rio Platano
   Biosphere Reserve) or gradients of alongshore sediment transport
   (e.g.Namib Sea) and (2) direct or indirect human interferences with
   natural coastal processes such as sand nourishment (e.g.Wadden Sea) and
   damming of river sediments upstream of a delta (e.g.Danube Delta).The
   most stable soft coasts are associated with the protection of coral reef
   ecosystems (e.g.Great Barrier Reef) which may be degraded/destroyed by
   climate change or human stress in the future. A positive correlation
   between shoreline retreat and local relative sea-level change was
   apparent in theWadden Sea. However, globally, the effects of
   contemporary sea-level rise are not apparent for coastal NWHS, but it is
   a major concern for the future reinforcing the shoreline dynamics
   already being observed due to other drivers. Hence, future assessments
   of shoreline change need to account for other drivers of coastal change
   in addition to sea-level rise projections. In conclusion, extreme
   multi-decadal linear shoreline trends occur in coastal NWHS and are
   driven primarily by sediment redistribution. Future exacerbation of
   these trends may affect heritage values and coastal communities. Thus
   shoreline change should be considered in future management plans where
   necessary. This approach provides a consistent method to assess NWHS
   which can be repeated and help steer future management of these
   important sites.},

Title = {The temporal variation of sediment connectivity from 1982 to 2020 in the
   Wei River basin, China},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Sediment connectivity is a valuable metric that characterizes the
   relationship between sediment transport from the source to the sink, and
   the ease of sediment erosion. Over the past four decades, changes in
   land use types and vegetation cover have significantly altered sediment
   dynamics in the Wei River basin. In this study, we used the index of
   connectivity (IC) to assess the temporal changes in sediment
   connectivity at a watershed scale. We employed Landsat images to analyse
   the relationship between changes in vegetation cover or land use type
   and sediment connectivity. We used factor detector and interaction
   detector in Geodetector to analyse the importance and impact of
   vegetation and slope on IC changes. We assessed the correlation of
   sediment yield and connectivity to validate our results and it shows
   that IC has strong or moderate positive correlation with sediment yield
   from eight out of nine stations in the Wei River Basin. Our findings
   demonstrate that soil and water conservation measures, as well as the
   grain for green project, have led to the transformation of cropland and
   grassland into woodland. This change is reflected in the decrease of the
   maximum IC value from 6.24 to 5.72 in the Beiluo sub-basin, indicating a
   decreasing trend in sediment connectivity. Although the maximum IC value
   increased from 5.76 to 5.08 in the Jing sub-basin, driven by human
   activity, showing an increasing trend. Furthermore, the IC value
   decreased in the western part of the Wei sub-basin. Overall, sediment
   connectivity exhibits a weak decreasing trend in most regions of the Wei
   River basin, while it shows an increasing trend slightly in the Jing
   sub-basin. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.86, with
   sediment yield being moderately or strongly correlated with IC. Our
   study identified vegetation, human activity, and slope as the main
   influencing factors of IC. The results of factor detector showed that
   the q value of vegetation was 0.63 and the slope was 0.1, Vegetation
   played a major role in the change of IC. The results of interaction
   detector showed that interaction between vegetation and slope was
   greater than the single factor. The temporal variability of sediment
   connectivity in the basin provides valuable insights for sediment
   transport management. Our research highlights the importance of studying
   sediment connectivity and offers proposals for measures that can be
   taken to address sediment transport challenges in the Wei River basin.

Abstract = {Mobile telemedicine integrates wireless communications for different
   telemedical applications, such as mobile phones and personal digital
   assistants, and with the implementation of modern wireless
   telecommunication, wireless local area network and satellite
   communication is a reality. New generation cellular phones or personal
   digital assistants have overcome limitations of image quality seen in
   older devices and, with dermatology being a visual profession, mobile
   teledermatology is perhaps the most recent development in this field.
   Mobile teledermatology may provide a triage service aimed toward
   management of patients with emergent skin disease or for follow-up with
   patients requiring systemic treatment. Teledermoscopy enables rapid
   transmission of dermoscopic images via e-mail or specific
   web-application and studies have demonstrated a high, 91\%, concordance
   between face-to-face diagnosis and remote diagnosis of such images.
   Further to this, telediagnosis of melanocytic skin neoplasms achieved a
   diagnostic accuracy of 83\% versus the conventional histopathologic
   diagnosis. Mobile teledermoscopy is the combination of such approaches
   enabling transfer of images captured with cellular phones coupled with a
   pocket dermatoscope and preliminary studies have demonstrated the
   feasibility and potential of its use in triage of pigmented lesions.
   Such applications are of benefit to physicians in enabling easy storage
   of data for follow-up or referral of images for expert second opinion
   and may facilitate a ``person-centered health system{''} for patients
   with numerous moles and pigmented skin lesions who could forward images
   for evaluation. The incidence of skin cancers has reached epidemic
   proportions among whites and the trend is still going upward. Mobile
   teledermatology and teledermoscopy may be implemented as a triage or
   screening tool for malignant tumors to facilitate early detection and
   diagnosis, which is crucial for improved patient outcomes. While the
   legal aspects concerning teleconsultations need to be evaluated, the
   communications technologies provide a unique opportunity for physicians
   and patients alike and we foresee a place for these tools in dermatology
   soon. Semin Cutan Mad Surg 28:203-205 (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The Dawen River Watershed (DRW), an important sub-basin of the Yellow
   River, has been experiencing substantial climatic and anthropogenic
   stresses. Identifying how stressors relate to shifts in vegetation
   growth is critical for maintaining the health and stability of its
   regional ecosystems. To address this, we constructed a 20-year dataset
   (1999-2018) reflecting changes in satellite-based normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), climate variables, and land use in the DRW. We
   then used time series, principal component, and partial correlation
   analyses to detect spatial and temporal patterns in vegetation dynamics
   over time, as well as linkages with temperature, precipitation, and
   anthropogenic activities. Over 20 years, the DRW exhibited a
   warming-greening trend and experienced four regime shifts in its
   climate-vegetation system, roughly centered on 2001, 2006, 2013, and
   2016. Both the average and maximum NDVI increased in all seasons, likely
   due to favorable changes in seasonal climatic conditions. Temperature
   was the dominant factor promoting vegetative growth in spring, autumn,
   and throughout the growing season. Precipitation had a considerable
   positive effect on the average NDVI during the summer. Spatial analyses
   indicated that 67.94\% of the study area exhibited significant increase
   in NDVI values over time, mainly locating in the mountains and in
   Dongping County; Significant NDVI decrease was generally located in the
   urban expansion areas around cities and counties. Land cover types and
   annual growth cycles appeared to govern spatial patterns and the extent
   of variation in vegetation growth, followed by land use-related drivers
   and climate anomalies. These findings offer an insight on appropriate
   ecological management and climatic adaptation within the Dawen River
   Watershed.},

Abstract = {Land use and land cover changes are driven by human actions and, in
   turn, drive changes that alter the availability of products and services
   for people and livestock. For proper planning, these cause-and-effect
   interrelations need to be understood. This is especially important for
   Ethiopia where the resource base is declining and should be improved in
   order to feed the growing population. To better understand these
   interrelations, we studied trends in the natural resource base over is
   35-year period for two contrasting sites in the Ethiopian Highlands:
   semi-arid and water-short Lenche Dima, and sub-humid and
   moisture-sufficient Kuhar Michael. Information was obtained using
   time-series satellite images, geographical positioning system, a
   socio-economic survey and a document review Results showed that for
   sub-arid Lenche Dima there were minimal changes in land use and land
   cover patterns, while in water-sufficient Kuhar Michael cropland greatly
   increased at the expense of the grazing land and bare soil. At the same
   time land holding size and cattle numbers decreased in lair die Dima
   while they remained the same in Kuhar Michael, although overall land
   holdings remained larger in Lenche Dima than in Kuhar Michael. This
   study thus found large differences in development of agriculture since
   the 1970s: intensification of agriculture is possible in the
   water-sufficient sub-humid climate by displacing animal husbandry with
   high value crops that need irrigation during the dry monsoon season.
   This is not possible for he semi-arid area where water is the limiting
   factor in production even if a market is close by Agriculture in the
   semi-arid areas also requires larger land holdings because of the risk
   of droughts and low yields during some years. This comparative analysis
   suggests that without sufficient water, the shift from subsistent to
   commercial market-driven agriculture cannot be easily accomplished.},

Abstract = {Recent trends in cancer surgery have shown that the same cure rates can
   be achieved with more organ and tissue sparing techniques and multimodal
   approaches. Developments in technology and better patient care now
   render most operations to be possible.
   In the past radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) used to
   save many lives because most of the patients were presenting at advanced
   stages. Thanks to modern imaging techniques and health awareness of the
   public, today, most of the patients are presenting with small
   incidentally detected renal masses. Apart from patients requiring organ
   preservation for absolute and relative indications, most patients today
   are enjoying the benefits of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in an
   elective setting.
   The crucial step in NSS is to get control of the renal vessels first and
   to expose the whole kidney to look for satellite cortical lesions. A
   safe rim of healthy tissue has to be removed together with the tumor.
   All bleeders are sutured, and if the collecting system is entered, it
   should be repaired. The parenchyma is sutured for approximation with
   absorbable sutures.
   The long term results with NSS show acceptable oncological outcome. The
   rate of complications of NSS has dramatically decreased with better
   patient selection, improved techniques and better management. All
   patients should be informed of the complications, recurrence rates and
   follow-up conditions.
   The advances in laparoscopic techniques now render NSS possible in
   selected patients. However, this is an extremely challenging operation,
   and can only be performed in expert hands. New technology is also
   emerging utilizing new forms of energy for tumor destruction and
   ultimately for nephron sparing approaches in localized RCC. As we are
   detecting more small renal masses, some of which are benign, NSS will
   remain to be the treatment of choice for these patients. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, increasing water levels of Lake Alakol have
   led to the activation of processes of modern relief formation of the
   coastal territory. This study will make it possible to assess the
   vulnerability of the lake shore to modern relief-forming processes,
   which pose a threat to the economic and infrastructural development of
   the coast. Through a combination of field research methods, analysis of
   the archival materials and satellite images, GIS mapping, as well as the
   application of the Coastal Vulnerability Index, developed by Gornitz, a
   map of the modern relief of the coast of Lake Alakol was created, where
   13 geomorphological types of relief were identified, and a map of
   relief-forming processes and leading exogenous processes were
   identified. The values of the assessment of the degree of vulnerability
   of the coast to dangerous processes by the Gornitz method were obtained,
   where a high vulnerability covers 67.4\% of the coast, an average
   vulnerability covers 2.9\%, a weak vulnerability covers 13.3\%, and low
   vulnerability occupies 16.4\% of the coast. The degree of vulnerability
   of types of relief in the study area, the coast of Lake Alakol, was
   determined. High degree occupies 42.8\% of the study area,
   medium-30.7\%, weak-25.4\%, and low 1.1\%. A map of the complex
   assessment of the degree of vulnerability of the coast of Lake Alakol
   was created. It was revealed that low accumulative types of relief of
   the northwest and northeast coasts and alluvial-proluvial types of
   relief are highly vulnerable due to waterlogging and the intensity of
   abrasion processes. Identified natural features of the relief formation
   of the coast of Lake Alakol are recommended as a basis for making
   decisions on the planning and implementation of any economic activities
   on the coast, including infrastructure development of the coast and
   strengthening of the shores.},

Title = {Correlation Between Oncotype DX, PREDICT and the Nottingham Prognostic
   Index: Implications for the Management of Early Breast Cancer},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Breast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosis in the UK. The
   current clinical practice utilises two different types of modalities to
   estimate the prognosis, risk of recurrence and benefit from adjuvant
   chemotherapy treatment in patients with early breast cancer. The first
   set of modalities includes risk calculators based on clinicopathological
   features, e.g. PREDICT or the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI); the
   second includes genetic profiling of tumour tissue using Oncotype DX
   (ODX; Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) testing. PREDICT, NPI and ODX
   stratify breast cancers into high-, intermediate- and low-risk
   categories to help guide adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions. This
   study compares PREDICT, NPI and ODX Recurrence Scores (RS), with the aim
   of assessing 1) the correlation between the RS for PREDICT, NPI and ODX
   and 2) whether early breast cancer patients are stratified into similar
   risk categories by all three modalities.
   Methods
   This retrospective study included early breast cancer patients treated
   at a National Health Service (NHS) hospital over a 12-month period
   (October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria: consecutive
   patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth
   factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative and lymph node-negative breast cancer.
   All patients were discussed at the local multidisciplinary team (MDT)
   meeting and underwent ODX testing. Exclusion criteria: patients without
   ODX test scores; patients with an in-breast recurrence; patients who did
   not undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); and patients with
   ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only. NPI and PREDICT scores were
   calculated for each patient using online tools, and ODX data was
   obtained through Genomic Health and MDT records. Patients were
   risk-stratified into high, intermediate and low risk of recurrence
   groups based on their PREDICT, NPI and ODX scores. The thresholds for
   risk stratification were based on current practice, which is
   evidence-based. Correlations between PREDICT, NPI and ODX scores were
   analysed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.
   Results
   Forty-six patients (mean age: 56 years), with a total of 57 early breast
   cancers, underwent ODX testing. Risk categories generated by PREDICT
   very strongly correlated with NPI for all patients (r=0.92; P<0.0001).
   However, the RS generated by ODX testing only strongly correlated for
   patients with low-risk PREDICT scores (r=0.51; P=0.0134), while no
   correlation between RS and PREDICT was observed for patients with
   intermediate- or high-risk PREDICT scores (r=-0.0064; P=0.9767). Similar
   results were seen between NPI and RS. Overall, only 19/46 (41.3\%)
   patients had an RS which corresponded to PREDICT risk category, while
   18/46 (39.1\%) patients had an RS that indicated a higher risk of
   recurrence than PREDICT, and 9/46 (19.6\%) patients had an RS indicating
   a lower risk of recurrence than PREDICT. Similar results were found when
   comparing RS and NPI.
   Conclusion
   The risk of recurrence estimated by ODX in patients deemed low risk by
   PREDICT or NPI highly correlated, while no such correlation existed in
   patients with an estimated intermediate- or high-risk breast cancer. In
   PREDICT- or NPI-estimated intermediate- and high-risk patients, ODX
   provided valuable additional prognostic information to guide adjuvant
   treatment, while the potential avoidance of ODX testing in low-risk
   patients presents significant cost-savings.},

Abstract = {B-learning (blended learning) usually combines classical face-to-face
   classroom methods and computer-mediated activities. It emerges to
   overcome the total absence of human contact in the e-learning
   (electronic learning) which tends to compromise the learning outcomes.
   Professors have an important role in oral explanations and at the same
   new technologies also offer some advantages. Related to the face to face
   methods, they can be partially replaced by virtual classrooms (in mobile
   devices, m-learning) and computer-mediated activities can include
   pre-recorded lectures to improve this method. In this way, students, in
   some subjects, can receive the face education from anywhere without the
   necessity of being physically at the same location where the class
   physically takes place. Therefore, students who do not have the means or
   time to be present can benefit from the advantages of receiving the
   student class anywhere. This paper will explain experiences on Masters,
   Seminars and Courses conducted at the Universidad Catolica of Avila
   (UCAV) and Universidad Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M) during the 2013-2014
   academic year, which has combined both specialties b-learning and
   m-learning. They have combined the (physical or virtual) face education
   taught by teachers with computer-mediated activities.
   Master of Forestry Engineering, Remote Sensing Seminar and GIS
   (Geographical Information Systems) course applied to the Territorial
   Planning could be followed, depending on the personal student
   circumstances, either in person at Universidad Catolica of Avila or from
   their own homes or mobiles devices in virtual classroom (through the
   Blackboard Collaborate platform). Live Audio \& Video panel,
   Participants panel, dynamic Collaboration toolbar whit digital
   slideshows provided students access to the same presentation they would
   see in the actual lecture hall. Chat simulated conversations students
   would have in study groups. Virtual classroom simulated a real-world
   interaction asking frequently questions and using tools as raising hands
   and stepping away from the session and menus for selecting polling
   responses and feedback options. Main drawbacks resulted from video
   issues, poor Internet connections, and mainly Java updating and firewall
   issues. Training (workshop for teachers) and technical support are both
   very important to obtain good results in the frame of virtual
   classrooms.
   Industrial Engineering Master at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid was
   composed of a series of slideshow material focusing on the background
   that the student should master previously to the Master Courses
   ({''}0-course{''}) and pre-recorded lectures offered in moodle-like
   platforms. Students could consult them several times or choose the parts
   of the presentation they need to listen at with more attention. These
   pre-recorded videos were useful to close the gap of some students in a
   not too large interval of time, so they could also focus on the proper
   Master Course subjects. At the same time, students who already had the
   necessary background on the considered topics also took profit of these
   lectures, by consolidating their knowledge on the basis and strengthen
   its application to real practical engineering problems.
   This article will talk about these experiences, academic results and
   discuss about the benefits and drawbacks found by the implementation of
   these techniques.},

Abstract = {Geomagnetic storms play a critical role in space weather physics with
   the potential for far reaching economic impacts including power grid
   outages, air traffic rerouting, satellite damage and GPS disruption. The
   LFM-MIX is a state-of-the-art coupled magnetospheric-ionospheric model
   capable of simulating geomagnetic storms. Imbedded in this model are
   physical equations for turning the magnetohydrodynamic state parameters
   into energy and flux of electrons entering the ionosphere, involving a
   set of input parameters. The exact values of these input parameters in
   the model are unknown, and we seek to quantify the uncertainty about
   these parameters when model output is compared to observations. The
   model is available at different fidelities: a lower fidelity which is
   faster to run, and a higher fidelity but more computationally intense
   version. Model output and observational data are large spatiotemporal
   systems; the traditional design and analysis of computer experiments is
   unable to cope with such large data sets that involve multiple
   fidelities of model output. We develop an approach to this inverse
   problem for large spatiotemporal data sets that incorporates two
   different versions of the physical model. After an initial design, we
   propose a sequential design based on expected improvement. For the
   LFM-MIX, the additional run suggested by expected improvement diminishes
   posterior uncertainty by ruling out a posterior mode and shrinking the
   width of the posterior distribution. We also illustrate our approach
   using the Lorenz `96 system of equations for a simplified atmosphere,
   using known input parameters. For the Lorenz `96 system, after
   performing sequential runs based on expected improvement, the posterior
   mode converges to the true value and the posterior variability is
   reduced.},

Title = {Quantitative Precipitation Estimation of Extremes in CONUS With Radar
   Data},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale,
   long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal
   changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the
   extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative
   precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily
   return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky
   Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than
   similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether
   rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate
   extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between
   gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at
   locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges
   is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics
   derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial
   resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern
   United States.
   Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of
   precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is
   crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and
   resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is
   desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on
   average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event,
   such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that
   certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated
   on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This
   means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings
   of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to
   accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is
   imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way
   that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest
   requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step
   toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term,
   high-resolution precipitation data set.},

Title = {Vegetation responses to climate change in the Qilian Mountain Nature
   Reserve, Northwest China},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of vegetation responses to climate change can
   provide important information for environmental management. The Qilian
   Mountain Nature Reserve in Northwest China, a high-altitude mountainous
   region that is of critical ecological importance, has been affected by
   drastic climate change. However, the response of vegetation to climate
   change in this area has not been established. This study aims to address
   three unanswered questions. First, what is the relative importance of
   temperature and precipitation change in driving regional vegetation
   change? Second, how does this vegetation-climate relationship manifest
   itself across different timescales (e.g., seasonal)? Third, what is the
   spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation-climate relationship? Based on
   MODIS data and daily meteorological data from 41 stations within and
   adjacent to the reserve, we used Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition
   (EEMD), Theil-Sen median trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall nonparametric
   test, and Pearson correlation analysis to study the evolution of
   temperature, precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI). The key results are as follows: (1) during 1985-2019, the
   temperature in the reserve has increased by an average of 0.048 degrees
   C/a, with the largest average annual increases occurring in spring
   (0.069 degrees C) and summer (0.056 degrees C); (2) during the same
   period, precipitation in the reserve increased by an average of 1.17
   mm/a, with the largest annual increases occurring in autumn (0.669 mm)
   and summer (0.545 mm); (3) during 2001-2019, the NDVI increased by an
   average of 0.004/a; an average annual increase was experienced in all
   seasons, although the largest increase occurred in summer; (4) there is
   a statistically significant positive correlation (0.619) between the
   NDVI and temperature at the annual scale; (5) in contrast, the
   correlation between the NDVI and precipitation is weaker and not
   statistically significant (0.368), which indicates that temperature is
   the dominant factor affecting vegetation changes in the reserve; (6)
   there exist seasonal differences in the vegetation-climate relationship.
   The positive correlation between NDVI and temperature is strongest in
   spring whereas the positive correlation between NDVI and precipitation
   is strongest in summer; (7) the vegetation-climate relations demonstrate
   a degree of spatial heterogeneity driven by variability in climate
   factors and ecosystems. The value of this research is that it analyzes
   the response characteristics of vegetation to climate change using
   multiple methods and at multiple scales, providing a useful reference
   for understanding vegetation changes and their response to climate
   change in high-altitude mountain regions.},

Abstract = {The project aims at developing and deploying a common framework for both
   integrating local PKI (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509 digital
   certificates) deployments in an interoperable manner as well as
   providing interoperable digital certificates to the users of SWIM. The
   resulting PKI and its associated trust framework, which will be part of
   the cyber security infrastructure of aviation systems, are required to
   sign, emit and maintain digital certificates and revocation lists as
   required in the PCP (Pilot Common Project) family 5.1.4. The digital
   certificates will allow user authentication and encryption/decryption
   when and where needed in order to ensure that information can be
   securely transferred. All aviation Stakeholders (ANSPs, Airspace users,
   MIL, Airport, etc ...) will benefit from the project.
   The scope of the project includes the definition and development of a
   dedicated common PKI and its associated trust framework for European
   aviation, its integration and validation with some Stakeholders. It will
   ensure the interoperability of digital certificates within Europe and
   with other regions. Although the initial intent was to deliver
   certificates for SWIM, this solution will provide its services to other
   potential users such as e.g. ATS Message Handling System (AMHS), future
   Data Link Services, Satellite Based Augmentation System, Radar sensors.
   The project will develop interoperability/cross-certification framework
   (criteria, checklist). This sub-task will define the criteria that will
   have to be satisfied by the developed and deployed Bridge/PKI platform
   in order to be cross-certified by another Bridge/PKI. The
   cross-certification criteria (some kind of audit list) will be both ways
   as they will also have to be applied to other Bride(s)/PKI(s). The
   cross-certification process, steps and outcome (form) will be described
   to ensure that the full process is known and can be communicated to
   other candidate regional Bridges/PKIs.
   The project will aim at ensuring interoperability with others PKIs e.g.
   US Federal Bridge (USFB). Once developed, the cross-certification
   criteria will be submitted the USFB for validation. A prototype will be
   as well developed to demonstrate the concept based on scenarios defined
   jointly with the FAA as part of this sub-task. Such demonstration will
   also support the validation of the platform function, technical and
   operational requirements. The FAA will develop its part of the
   demonstrator.
   This project will work in close cooperation with the ICAO related
   initiatives so-called INNOVA/ACORNS (Aviation Community Operational
   Resilience Network Services) which intend to set a global framework for
   the use of digital certificates in aviation.
   The project was initiated on November 12th 2018. It is planned to be
   completed by no later than end 2021. The main challenge of this project
   lies in the governance and business model that will be accepted to
   develop (through Call For Tenders) and operate the service (e.g. a la
   NewPENS or other model).},

Title = {Detecting <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in community surveys: a

   polymerase chain reaction in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},

Abstract = {BackgroundMicroscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the main
   techniques used to diagnose malaria. While microscopy is considered the
   gold standard, RDTs have established popularity as they allow for rapid
   diagnosis with minimal technical skills. This study aimed to compare the
   diagnostic performance of two Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
   protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based RDTs (Paracheck Pf (R) Test (Paracheck) and
   Malaria Pf (TM) ICT (ICT)) to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a
   community survey.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted between
   October 2012 and December 2014 in Mutasa District, Manicaland Province,
   eastern Zimbabwe. Households were randomly selected using satellite
   imagery, and 224 households were visited. Residents present in the
   household on the date of the visit were recruited for the study.
   Participants of all age groups from the selected households were
   screened with Paracheck and ICT RDTs in parallel. Dried blood spots
   (DBS) and thin and thick smears were collected. Parasite DNA extracted
   from the DBS was subjected to nested PCR targeting the Plasmodium
   cytochrome b mitochondrial gene. Data analysis was performed using the
   Cohen's Kappa test to determine the interrater agreement and the
   sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test were
   reported.ResultsResults from a total of 702 participants were analysed.
   Most were females, 397 (57\%), and the median age of participants was 21
   years with an interquartile range of 9-39 years. Of those who were
   screened, 8 (1.1\%), 35 (5.0\%), and 21 (2.9\%) were malaria parasite
   positive by microscopy, RDT and PCR, respectively. Paracheck and ICT
   RDTs had a 100\% agreement. Comparing RDT and PCR results, 34
   participants (4.8\%) had discordant results. Most of the discordant
   cases were RDT positive but PCR negative (n=24). Half of those RDT
   positive, but PCR negative individuals reported anti-malarials to use in
   the past month, which is significantly higher than reported
   anti-malarial drug use in the population (p<0.001). The participant was
   febrile on the day of the visit, but relying on PfHRP2-based RDT would
   miss this case. Among the diagnostic methods evaluated, with reference
   to PCR, the sensitivity was higher with the RDT (52.4\%) while
   specificity was higher with the microscopy (99.9\%). The positive
   predictive value (PPV) was higher with the microscopy (87.5\%), while
   the negative predictive values were similar for both microscopy and RDTs
   (98\%). Overall, a strong correlated agreement with PCR was observed for
   the microscopy (97.9\%) and the RDTs (95.2\%).ConclusionsParacheck and
   ICT RDTs showed 100\% agreement and can be used interchangeably. As
   malaria transmission declines and Zimbabwe aims to reach malaria
   elimination, management of infected individuals with low parasitaemia as
   well as non-P. falciparum infection can be critical.},

   federal statistics describing the U.S. outdoor recreation economy. These
   new statistics show that outdoor recreation represented 2.2\% of the
   U.S. economy from 2012 to 2016, similar in size to the utilities and
   mining industries. Boating/fishing contributed \$38.2 billion to gross
   output in 2016, followed by game areas (includes golfing and tennis)
   (\$36.3 billion) and RVing (\$30.8 billion). Additionally, more than 4.5
   million jobs were generated by the outdoor recreation economy in 2016,
   resulting in \$213.6 billion of compensation paid to U.S. workers. These
   new statistics provide for the first time a comprehensive and consistent
   measure of the value of outdoor recreation to the U.S. economy. Any
   future updates to these statistics may consider adding regional data and
   a longer time series to provide even more meaningful statistics to
   researchers and policymakers.
   Management implications: New statistics provide estimates of the outdoor
   recreation economy from an unbiased source: the outdoor recreation
   satellite account (ORSA). The ORSA provides a solid framework to measure
   the outdoor economy and can be used
   -To show the significance of the outdoor recreation economy
   -To compare its relevance with other economic sectors
   -To examine the growth of the outdoor recreation economy over time in a
   detailed manner
   -To pay attention to specific outdoor recreation activities and their
   respective changes over time.},

Abstract = {The development of methods for rapid flood mapping and risk assessment
   is a key step to increase the usefulness of flood early warning systems
   and is crucial for effective emergency response and flood impact
   mitigation. Currently, flood early warning systems rarely include
   real-time components to assess potential impacts generated by forecasted
   flood events. To overcome this limitation, this study describes the
   benchmarking of an operational procedure for rapid flood risk assessment
   based on predictions issued by the European Flood Awareness System
   (EFAS). Daily streamflow forecasts produced for major European river
   networks are translated into event-based flood hazard maps using a large
   map catalogue derived from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.
   Flood hazard maps are then combined with exposure and vulnerability
   information, and the impacts of the forecasted flood events are
   evaluated in terms of flood-prone areas, economic damage and affected
   population, infrastructures and cities. An extensive testing of the
   operational procedure has been carried out by analysing the catastrophic
   floods of May 2014 in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia. The
   reliability of the flood mapping methodology is tested against
   satellite-based and report-based flood extent data, while modelled
   estimates of economic damage and affected population are compared
   against ground-based estimations. Finally, we evaluate the skill of risk
   estimates derived from EFAS flood forecasts with different lead times
   and combinations of probabilistic forecasts. Results highlight the
   potential of the real-time operational procedure in helping emergency
   response and management.},

Title = {Dynamic geospatial modeling of mycotoxin contamination of corn in
   Illinois: unveiling critical factors and predictive insights with
   machine learning},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination of corn is a pervasive problem that negatively
   impacts human and animal health and causes economic losses to the
   agricultural industry worldwide. Historical aflatoxin (AFL) and
   fumonisin (FUM) mycotoxin contamination data of corn, daily weather
   data, satellite data, dynamic geospatial soil properties, and land usage
   parameters were modeled to identify factors significantly contributing
   to the outbreaks of mycotoxin contamination of corn grown in Illinois
   (IL), AFL >20 ppb, and FUM >5 ppm. Two methods were used: a gradient
   boosting machine (GBM) and a neural network (NN). Both the GBM and NN
   models were dynamic at a state-county geospatial level because they used
   GPS coordinates of the counties linked to soil properties. GBM
   identified temperature and precipitation prior to sowing as significant
   influential factors contributing to high AFL and FUM contamination.
   AFL-GBM showed that a higher aflatoxin risk index (ARI) in January,
   March, July, and November led to higher AFL contamination in the
   southern regions of IL. Higher values of corn-specific normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) in July led to lower AFL
   contamination in Central and Southern IL, while higher wheat-specific
   NDVI values in February led to higher AFL. FUM-GBM showed that
   temperature in July and October, precipitation in February, and NDVI
   values in March are positively correlated with high contamination
   throughout IL. Furthermore, the dynamic geospatial models showed that
   soil characteristics were correlated with AFL and FUM contamination.
   Greater calcium carbonate content in soil was negatively correlated with
   AFL contamination, which was noticeable in Southern IL. Greater soil
   moisture and available water-holding capacity throughout Southern IL
   were positively correlated with high FUM contamination. The higher clay
   percentage in the northeastern areas of IL negatively correlated with
   FUM contamination. NN models showed high class-specific performance for
   1-year predictive validation for AFL (73\%) and FUM (85\%), highlighting
   their accuracy for annual mycotoxin prediction. Our models revealed that
   soil, NDVI, year-specific weekly average precipitation, and temperature
   were the most important factors that correlated with mycotoxin
   contamination. These findings serve as reliable guidelines for future
   modeling efforts to identify novel data inputs for the prediction of AFL
   and FUM outbreaks and potential farm-level management practices.},

Abstract = {The knowledge management, like a strategic resource, has gained great
   importance for business development and knowledge transfer processes
   became a key issue in allowing firms to get new sources of information.
   The study looks at the reality of industrial districts, where, normally,
   equality and fairness create the conditions upon which firms share their
   own knowledge. However, often, these contexts, in contrasts to the
   traditional Marshallian industrial district (Marshall, 1879, Becattini,
   1981), are characterized by an asymmetric power relationship among the
   parties, according to the Hub and Spoke district (Markusen, 1996). The
   case study of Val d'Agri, the most important Italian oil district, is an
   example of Hub-and-spoke District, with the dominance of a bigger firm
   (Eni) to manage all the relationship along the chain. The discovery of
   the Val d'Agri was made by ENI, in 1988.
   Purpose - Starting from the description of Val d'Agri district, our
   paper aims at mapping the local relationships, in order to define the
   way firms relate along the district value chain, with reference to both
   their position, and their own ``contractual power{''}; and to understand
   how firms position, as well as their different contractual power, affect
   knowledge transfer process within the district. Taking into account the
   ``Hub and Spoke{''} morphology, we support the idea that knowledge
   transfer is deeply affected by firms' contractual power, as well as by
   their position within the district. Explicit knowledge transfer is
   mainly linked to the development of production process; on the contrary,
   the transfer of tacit knowledge depends, above all, by the action people
   place within the district; so, human capital plays a very important role
   in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social
   interaction.
   Design/methodology/approach - We propose an empirical approach. This
   work will start providing an analysis of the main characteristics of the
   relational structure of Val d'Agri, in order to identify the main issues
   that can impact the development process of knowledge transfer. The study
   consists of two parts: in the first part, it will develop an analysis of
   the main national and international literature on the field, from both
   economic and managerial perspectives; in the second part, an empirical
   analysis will be developed. For the analysis were contacted about 100
   firms of satellite ENI industries (the biggest ones), both the same ENI.
   Were sent questionnaires for asking questions about the company
   structure, specialization, the typology of formal relationships exists
   with the leader, the company's distinctive knowledge, the existence of
   knowledge management systems.
   Originality/value - Since the importance that both industrial districts
   and knowledge transfer have for firms competition, the paper aims at
   giving a new and valuable framework useful to understand, not only the
   district dynamics, but also the way knowledge transfer may be fostered
   among all the firms related along a given value chain.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the application puts in
   evidence the peculiarity of an oil district, because the birth of this
   form of district is closely related to land resources. In addition,
   national laws and regulations that govern the exploitation of oil in
   Italy, create positions of power within the production chain, which
   alter the relationship between the companies, compared to what happens
   in the traditional type of Marshallian districts.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest conservation and management can significantly benefit
   from information about the spatial distribution of tree species.
   Very-high resolution (VHR) spaceborne platforms have been hailed as a
   promising technology for mapping tree species over broad spatial
   extents. WorldView-3, the most advanced VHR sensor, provides spectral
   data in 16 bands covering the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040
   nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1210-2365 nm) wavelength ranges. It
   also collects images at unprecedented levels of details using a
   panchromatic band with 0.3-m of spatial resolution. However, the
   potential of WorldView-3 at its full spectral and spatial resolution for
   tropical tree species classification remains unknown. In this study, we
   performed a comprehensive assessment of WorldView-3 images acquired in
   the dry and wet seasons for tree species discrimination in tropical
   semi-deciduous forests. Classification experiments were performed using
   VNIR individually and combined with SWIR channels. To take advantage of
   the sub-metric resolution of the panchromatic band for classification,
   we applied an individual tree crown (ITC)-based approach that employed
   pan sharpened VNIR bands and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture
   features. We determined whether the combination of images from the two
   annual seasons improves the classification accuracy. Finally, we
   investigated which plant traits influenced species detection. The new
   SWIR sensing capabilities of WorldView-3 increased the average
   producer's accuracy up to 7.8\%, by enabling the detection of
   non-photosynthetic vegetation within ITCs. The combination of VNIR bands
   from the two annual seasons did not improve the classification results
   when compared to the results obtained using images from each season
   individually. The use of VNIR bands at their original 1.2-m spatial
   resolution yielded average producer's accuracies of 43.1 +/- 3.1\% and
   38.8 +/- 3\% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The ITC -based
   approach improved the accuracy to 70 +/- 8\% in the wet and 68.4 +/-
   7.4\% in the dry season. Texture analysis of the panchromatic band
   enabled the detection of species-specific differences in crown
   structure, which improved species detection. The use of texture
   analysis, pan-sharpening, and ITC delineation is a potential approach to
   perform tree species classification in tropical forests with WorldView-3
   satellite images.},

Abstract = {Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide
   susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the
   same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the
   models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been
   explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest
   (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then
   explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model
   is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two
   typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological
   conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide
   inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images,
   and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in
   Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of
   topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were
   prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical
   ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were
   adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based
   model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was
   applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix
   and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value
   (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model
   delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County,
   indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where
   the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the
   Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the
   Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other
   than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study
   could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain
   and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting
   landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve
   efficiency in practice.},

Title = {Optimizing broiler performance using different amino acid density diets:
   What are the limits?},

Abstract = {Broiler responses of economic interest, such as BW gain, FCR, and breast
   meat yield (BMY), can be optimized by increasing amino acid (AA)
   concentrations, improving the AA balance, or both. The AA requirements
   to maximize a response are lowest for BW gain, increased for FCR, and
   highest for BMY. A maximum performance response is reached when the
   response plateaus, whereas an optimal response is the one providing the
   highest return per input. These are usually not the same. Strategies
   used in linear feed formulation differ in how dietary AA are included in
   the diet; therefore, understanding how these strategies affect broiler
   responses is necessary to compare ultimate potential benefits. Minimum
   CP restrictions are still used even when TSAA, Lys, and Thr restrictions
   are set simultaneously, and AA requirements are presently expressed as
   either total or digestible. The use of ratios of essential AA to Lys is
   more popular now that synthetic Thr has become commercially available,
   and it will likely have an increase in use when L-valine and
   L-isoleucine have competitive prices. The present-day high-yield broiler
   has an increased responsiveness to AA density, especially for Lys, which
   contrasts with published requirements still in use. Increasing Lys and
   other AA at the beginning of the bird's life has been shown to have some
   positive carryover effects on performance in later periods; however,
   increasing the Lys and essential AA in broiler diets in the last phases
   of production allows compensation for BMY because of the continuous high
   allometric growth rate of breast muscle. Gains in performance are
   expected to result from increases in dietary AA density; however, the
   decision regarding what AA density to use will depend on the cost of
   feed relative to the market price of meat.},

Abstract = {The means of communication has long served to connect millions of
   people, living in the territories divided by the huge distances. One can
   easily consider them as the first manifestation of the globalization
   processes. The methods of communication constantly improved and
   diversified - from messengers and postal workers, through telegraph,
   radio and landline phones to the mobile and satellite communication,
   VoIP (Skupe, Viber \& other), Instagram, Telegram (messenger) etc. The
   telecommunication industry is rapidly developing throughout the world
   (Jerbashian, 2015), and Russia is no exception. However, the global
   economic crisis of 2008-2009 considerably influenced this industry too.
   The credit risks that the telecommunication companies of Russia had
   faced in 2006-2007, before the global crisis, caused significant changes
   within the structure of the Russian mobile service market. (Dengov \&
   Tulyakova, 2015). Where initially there had been several dozen mobile
   operators, defining the nature of the market as a monopolistic
   competition, within but a few years all the key positions there were
   taken by four major companies (domestic MTS, Megafon, Beeline and the
   Swedish company Tele-2), keeping out any new operators. In the two new
   articles on this topic, the authors address the analysis of the pricing
   strategies of the major operators within the Russian telecommunication
   market. In the first article, they calculated the concentration indices
   of the industry. Their values lead the authors to the conclusion about
   the ``diluted{''} oligopoly that has fully emerged by now in the mobile
   communication market. As the result of their research, the authors came
   to certain conclusions about the character of the pricing policies of
   the main mobile operators in the Russian Federation and the strategies
   that they implement in view of price differentiation within the
   different regions.},

Title = {Climate change impacts on selected global rangeland ecosystem services},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rangelands are Earth's dominant land cover and are important providers
   of ecosystem services. Reliance on rangelands is projected to grow, thus
   understanding the sensitivity of rangelands to future climates is
   essential. We used a new ecosystem model of moderate complexity that
   allows, for the first time, to quantify global changes expected in
   rangelands under future climates. The mean global annual net primary
   production (NPP) may decline by 10 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2050 under
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, but herbaceous NPP is
   projected to increase slightly (i.e., average of 3 g C m(-2) year(-1)).
   Responses vary substantially from place-to-place, with large increases
   in annual productivity projected in northern regions (e.g., a 21\%
   increase in productivity in the US and Canada) and large declines in
   western Africa (-46\% in sub-Saharan western Africa) and Australia
   (-17\%). Soil organic carbon is projected to increase in Australia
   (9\%), the Middle East (14\%), and central Asia (16\%) and decline in
   many African savannas (e.g., -18\% in sub-Saharan western Africa).
   Livestock are projected to decline 7.5 to 9.6\%, an economic loss of
   from \$9.7 to \$12.6 billion. Our results suggest that forage production
   in Africa is sensitive to changes in climate, which will have
   substantial impacts on the livelihoods of the more than 180 million
   people who raise livestock on those rangelands. Our approach and the
   simulation tool presented here offer considerable potential for
   forecasting future conditions, highlight regions of concern, and support
   analyses where costs and benefits of adaptations and policies may be
   quantified. Otherwise, the technical options and policy and enabling
   environment that are needed to facilitate widespread adaptation may be
   very difficult to elucidate.},

Title = {An integrated economic-ecological index based on satellite-derived

   Shaanxi, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Carbon sequestration reflecting vegetation productivity is essential for
   global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystems. Exploring the spatial
   and temporal variation of carbon sequestration and corresponding
   ecological values yields insights for policy formulation to mitigate
   carbon emission and achieve carbon neutrality. Hence, taking Shaanxi
   China as the case study, we developed an integrated index (named C-GDP)
   based on vegetation carbon sequestration estimated by the CASA model and
   carbon prices acquired from carbon trading market in China to explore
   tradeoffs between economic and ecological development. The
   spatiotemporal distributions of carbon sequestration and C-GDP were
   characterized using hotspot analysis and variation coefficient during
   2015-2020. The estimated carbon sequestrations were assessed with
   promising accuracy, depicting high values in the south and low values in
   the north, with provincial averages of 1761.37gC/m2a. Temporally, carbon
   sequestrations increased with fluctuation between 2015 and 2020, with
   significant seasonality. Summertime, especially July, has the highest
   sequestration, while winter is the season with the lowest values. The
   C-GDP calculated by carbon sequestration and carbon price exhibited a
   distinct pattern with sequestration, with the highest C-GDP in Central
   Shaanxi and the lowest in the south. The multi-year provincial-mean
   C-GDP is 20.44 billion yuan. The C-GDP exhibited an increase trend with
   miniscule fluctuation, peaking at 23.66 billion yuan in 2020. The
   results imply the ecological value of carbon sequestration monetizing by
   carbon prices is much lower than economical value of production,
   suggesting that strict carbon policies, such as improving carbon prices
   or taxes, may be warranted for China because of high carbon mitigation
   costs.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Spatio-temporal patterns of rain-use efficiency (RUE) can explicitly
   present the steady-state of ecosystem water use and thus ecosystem
   functioning. The west of Songliao Plain, located along the east fringe
   of the agro-pasture transitional zone in northern China, is highly
   sensitive to global change. In this study, satellite-based RUE was
   calculated using time series SPOT VEGETATION (SPOT-VGT) Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images and precipitation data for the
   study area from 1999 to 2011. Based on regression model by fitting
   simple linear regression through the pixel-based time series of RUE in
   the growing season and calculating the slopes, the change trend of RUE
   was determined. The grey relational analysis (GRA) method was extended
   to the spatial scale, and used to select sensitive climate and
   socio-economic factors that affected RUE variations. The result
   demonstrated that vegetation RUE increased slightly with an undulating
   trend, implying the ecosystem function tended to improve between 1999
   and 2011. In total, 4.23\% of the total area had experienced a
   significant increase in RUE, whereas 1.29\% of the total area presented
   a significant decrease. Areas showing increased RUE trends mostly
   coincided with areas of land cover conversions from grassland to forest,
   shrub to forest and cropland to forest, which suggested a positive
   linkage with ecological protection policy and projects at national and
   local levels. Based on the obtained spatial Grey Relation Grade (GRG)
   values, the pattern of the impact factors clearly showed a spatial
   heterogeneity. Spatially, sunshine duration, temperature and population
   density were most closely related to RUE in the west of Songliao Plain
   between 1999 and 2011.},

   change. A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed
   information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes.
   However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their
   coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of
   integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland
   freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a
   data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based
   spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to
   identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data
   limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans,
   continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes
   related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical
   aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and
   cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through
   geostatistical and/ or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby
   minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in
   process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE)
   between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere.
   Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study
   is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that
   need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories.
   Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling.
   In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates
   from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric
   inversions. This holds for Europe (mean +/- 1 SD: 0.8 +/- 0.1 PgC
   yr(-1), positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 +/-
   0.4 PgC yr(-1)), East Asia (1.6 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), South Asia (0.3 +/-
   0.1 PgC yr(-1)), Australia (0.2 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), and most of the
   Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in
   tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and
   because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global
   bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of 5.4 +/- 2.0 PgC yr(-1). By
   contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2
   over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source
   of 4.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr(-1)
   highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in
   tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment
   provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon
   observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land
   regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second,
   extensive pCO(2) data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack
   observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and
   inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data
   uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria
   optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS)
   and atmospheric inversions, without over-or under-stating bottom-up data
   credibility.
   In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at
   national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2
   fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which
   future emission reductions are proposed.},

Title = {Spatiotemporally Continuous Reconstruction of Retrieved PM<sub>2.5</sub>
   Data Using an Autogeoi-Stacking Model in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
   Region, China},

Abstract = {Aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations have been widely used to
   generate wide-coverage PM2.5 retrievals due to the adverse effects of
   long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the sparsity and unevenness of
   monitoring sites. However, due to non-random missing and nighttime gaps
   in AOD products, obtaining spatiotemporally continuous hourly data with
   high accuracy has been a great challenge. Therefore, this study
   developed an automatic geo-intelligent stacking (autogeoi-stacking)
   model, which contained seven sub-models of machine learning and was
   stacked through a Catboost model. The autogeoi-stacking model used the
   automated feature engineering (autofeat) method to identify
   spatiotemporal characteristics of multi-source datasets and generate
   extra features through automatic non-linear changes of multiple original
   features. The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) evaluation was employed to
   evaluate the 24-hour and continuous ground-level PM2.5 estimations in
   the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during 2018. The results showed
   that the autogeoi-stacking model performed well in the study area with
   the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.88, the root mean squared
   error (RMSE) of 17.38 mu g/m(3), and the mean absolute error (MAE) of
   10.71 mu g/m(3). The estimated PM2.5 concentrations had an excellent
   performance during the day (8:00-18:00, local time) and night
   (19:00-07:00) (the cross-validation coefficient of determination
   (CV-R-2): 0.90, 0.88), and captured hourly PM2.5 variations well, even
   in the severe ambient air pollution event. On the seasonal scale, the
   R-2 values from high to low were winter, autumn, spring, and summer,
   respectively. Compared with the original stacking model, the improvement
   of R-2 with the autofeat and hyperparameter optimization approaches was
   up to 5.33\%. In addition, the annual mean values indicated that the
   southern areas, such as Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Handan, suffered
   higher PM2.5 concentrations. The northern regions (e.g., Zhangjiakou and
   Chengde) experienced low PM2.5. In summary, the proposed method in this
   paper performed well and could provide ideas for constructing
   geoi-features and spatiotemporally continuous inversion products of
   PM2.5.},

Abstract = {The expansion of terrestrial applications including location-based
   services and transportation means such as road or train has fostered the
   design of complex location systems to comply with the needs of these
   applications. In the frame of the service provision ensured by the
   application towards a user or an external entity, these location systems
   are in charge of providing a consolidated information based on the
   position of one or more mobile platforms.
   The complexity of the information reported depends on the type of
   service targeted. It can range from a simple position reporting in the
   case of a low end asset management, to the provision of a reliable
   information (e.g. authenticated and with a mastered uncertainty) on the
   mobile's trajectory for liability critical services such as road
   charging or Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This wide spectrum of
   required technical features calls for a new and broader concept at
   location system level taking into account hybrid solutions in which the
   use of GNSS technologies is complemented with other technology sensors
   to improve the robustness and the performance of the solution.
   Several standards have been generated by different dedicated bodies, in
   order to support the GNSS market development across the various
   application domains mentioned above. For instance, 3GPP Location
   Services (LCS) standards provide minimum performance requirements mainly
   for Assisted-GNSS in the frame of terrestrial telecommunications and
   OMA-LOC LPPe (LTE Positioning Protocol Extensions) defines a
   communication protocol supporting hybridised positioning.
   Nevertheless, there is still a lack of performance specification for a
   large number of terrestrial applications (e.g. electronic fee
   collection, fleet management, container tracking.), including
   multi-modal applications (i.e. those involving various means of
   transport), leading to the development and use of sub-optimal GNSS-based
   systems and solutions.
   The need to unify the different initiatives by concentrating the
   positioning-related standardisation effort for terrestrial applications
   within a single dedicated entity was identified some time ago
   Accordingly, an initiative triggered by a number of industrial and
   institutional stakeholders materialized in the frame of the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This initiative is led by
   the group Satellite Communication and Navigation (SCN) of the Technical
   Committee Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (TC SES), the main
   objective being to elaborate a firm and common standard for GNSS-based
   Location systems. Up to now, the TC-SES has already approved end of 2012
   two Technical Reports related to architectures and application inventory
   which paved the way for the technical specifications to be developed.
   The present paper provides an overview of this on-going standardisation
   work, its objectives and the added-value it will bring. In addition, the
   already approved Technical Specifications will also be presented.
   Thus, the structure of the targeted standard encompasses the four
   following specifications:
   The location system minimum performance requirements, which can be
   considered as the core of the specification work. These requirements are
   determined function of the type of location systems (i.e. association of
   technical enablers), the applicable environmental conditions (depending
   on the type of application), and finally the type of features needed
   (e.g. accuracy, authentication, anti-spoofing, robustness to
   interference).
   The GNSS-based location system reference architecture including the
   interface definition, which is expected to capture a generic and modular
   definition of location systems, thus adaptable to all targeted
   applications.
   The data exchange protocol at location system level (covering in
   particular the handling of the requests from an external application
   provider and the protocol to ensure proper information delivery).
   The test specification (including procedure, scenario and data),
   enabling location system validation versus the previous requirements
   (protocol and performance).
   The methodology used to define the perimeter of the above specifications
   looks for:
   The definition of terrestrial application classes to be covered by the
   standard, including the identification of the key requirements
   (functional and performance) applicable for each application.
   The inventory of the technological enablers taken onboard in the
   standard. These enablers are understood as much as sensor technologies
   (GNSS receivers, Network sensors, inertial sensors, hybridization
   layer), as system layer features allowing Quality of Service (QoS)
   improvements (A-GNSS, D-GNSS, RTK, integrity functions, authentication
   functions).
   The definition of reference environments, derived from the applications'
   typical use cases, and which provide the necessary conditions to
   determine the minimum performance requirements.
   With the ambition to satisfy a wide range of terrestrial applications,
   the standard under preparation, once approved, will surely benefit to
   other standardization groups. Indeed, care is being taken to harmonize
   the work done under TC SES SCN, with standardisation groups in other
   domains. Furthermore, it will also be valuable to actors from markets
   whose specificities do not justify the existence of a dedicated
   standard. All these stakeholders will thus benefit from a more important
   variety of solutions, components and functions available, all of them
   simultaneously compatible to the standard.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to undertake process evaluation
   of the implementation of tele-care in a large care-providing
   organization in the Netherlands.. Method: The study was executed as a
   satellite study of the actual implementation of the Quiet Care tele-care
   system within the Proteion Care group in the south of the Netherlands.
   Data on the process of implementation was gathered through extensive
   document analysis, semi-structured interviews and participant
   observation. Based on these data the implementation performance and the
   caregivers' implementation, evaluated by the
   caregivers/staff/professionals, were investigated, guided by the
   framework for implementation from Grol and Wensing (2006). Results: The
   implementation was started with an introduction to some of the
   stakeholders at the home-care organization. After several months of
   practice, there were some misconceptions on the use of the facility,
   i.e. the fit thereof into daily care practice. Therefore, a restart of
   the implementation was organized with a customized training programme
   focusing on the relationship between innovation and professional
   behaviour as the subject matter. The implementation process involved
   professional training conveying the (evidence-based) added value of the
   implemented system. This training was positively evaluated by most of
   the participants. After the completion of the course the care providers
   enrolled more new clients for the Quiet Care system and used the outcome
   from the data to improve daily care and adjust the nursing care plan.
   The outcome of this changed approach was that the innovation was more
   accepted by caregivers. Analysis of the implementation process revealed
   the lack of a formal approach: there was no underlying implementation
   model resulting in the lack of coherence/commitment/sense of importance
   from an organizational viewpoint. Caregivers in the organization found
   the guidance by the staff of the implementation programme very
   supportive to their learning needs. But such a strongly imbedded ethos
   in the implementation staff introduced some reluctance in other
   management staff involved in the programme in taking over the ownership
   of the implemented innovation and thereby guaranteeing a continuous
   improvement of the innovation over time. Conclusion: The impact of the
   implementation of Quiet Care on the business processes could not
   previously be fully overseen. Ad hoc decisions had to be made to
   guarantee a continuous roll-out throughout the organization. The
   training participants perceived the training to be valuable because it
   was a) supportive in the use of the technology and b) supportive in
   their daily professional performances. This outcome supports the aim of
   the training to provide a meaningful learning environment in which the
   transfer of the experimental approach to daily practice could occur. The
   training was well evaluated and turned out to be a key element for
   success. The absence of a pre-formulated implementation plan proved to
   be a barrier for acceptance of the system at management level and
   hindered the uptake of the approach as part of the standard care
   provision. It is concluded that an implementation plan and
   evidence-based training programme have to be included as part of a
   strategy to implement health care technology in professional practice.
   This should be accompanied by an applied research path to observe the
   performance.},

Title = {Mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of alkaline lake
   sediments to trace origin, depositional processes, and anthropogenic
   impacts: Inle Lake (Southern Shan State, Myanmar)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Southeast Asia contains a major portion of wetland areas of
   international significance, but only 14\% of these wetlands are under
   protection. Inle Lake is the second largest freshwater body in Myanmar
   and the most important for its environmental, economic, and agricultural
   values. However, the lake is seriously threatened by anthropic
   activities as they are dramatically decreasing its open water surface.
   While water-quality studies have assessed the presence of nutrients and
   contaminants, little is known about the sediment quality. Therefore, the
   overall objective of the present study was to analyse the natural
   sedimentation patterns and the anthropogenic disturbances in this lake.
   To this end, both grab and core sediments were investigated by combining
   mineralogical, morphological, and geochemical analyses, and their
   composition was compared to the composition of rocks and soil from the
   watershed. Mineralogical data indicate that sediment samples collected
   at or near the main inflow, and at the outflow show a lower abundance
   (about 43\%) of calcite, which generally increases with depth in
   sediment cores, reaching more than 90\% in the centre of the lake. Lower
   calcite contents correspond to higher percentages of other minerals.
   These findings allow us to clearly distinguish the allogenic (quartz,
   mica/illite, kaolinite, and detrital calcite) from the endogenic (mostly
   calcite) minerals, as confirmed by the soil and rock mineralogy. The
   origin of the mineral contents at the different sites is further
   supported by the observation of the grain morphology and composition.
   The most abundant metal in the lake sediments is Ca, in agreement with
   the high calcite content. Following in order of abundance are Al, Fe,
   and K, which are connected to the detrital input to the lake. In the
   rock and soil samples, the most abundant trace element is Mn, which is
   significantly correlated with many other trace elements (e.g., Co, Cr,
   Cu, Ni, V, Zn, and As), suggesting their common lithogenic origin.
   Similarly, in the lake sediments, the trace elements Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb,
   V, Zn, and As display fairly homogenous concentration ranges, in the
   order of tens of ppm, and are strongly correlated with the detrital
   minerals (mica, kaolinite, and quartz) and negatively correlated with
   the calcite content. The mineralogical and elemental distribution in the
   lakebed area and with depth in the sediment cores allowed us to identify
   the increased soil and bedrock erosion as a major anthropogenic impact
   to the lake. The sedimentation disturbance is especially evident at the
   main inflow, the Nanlit stream, which has caused the development of a
   large alluvial fan, visible in satellite images. This large sediment
   input is likely to have accelerated the decrease in open water surface
   and in depth of this shallow lake. Additionally, when the measured
   concentrations of Potentially Toxic Elements were compared to
   consensus-based Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), it was shown that
   As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn often exceeded the threshold effect
   concentration (TEC), and that Cr, Ni, and Pb sometimes exceeded the
   probable effect concentration (PEC). On the other hand, Enrichment
   Factors (EFs), calculated with respect to soils of the watershed, showed
   minimal enrichment and indicated that the potential toxicity effect was
   primarily a result of detrital sedimentation outpacing carbonate
   sedimentation.
   Sediment characterisation allowed us to obtain a better understanding of
   lake dynamics and environmental impacts, which is fundamental in
   achieving effective management and maintenance of the ecological
   character of Inle Lake, in line with the objective set by the Ramsar
   Convention for wetlands of international relevance.},

Abstract = {Balloon-based astronomical missions offer a potential for cost-effective
   large and complex astronomical infrastructure in between ground and
   space-based observatories. Balloons are particularly suitable for UV and
   IR observations. Even though stratospheric observations have a long
   history, they have been up to recently they have been one-shot missions.
   The design of balloon platforms is usually formed around one or more
   specific instruments and their requirements. Not surprisingly, flight
   and ground software architecture in these missions may often seem like a
   second thought, with very limited flexibility intended. The relatively
   limited budget and short operations time of these platforms to some
   extent justifies the decision to not invest in a flexible flight or
   ground software. The same applies to the onboard autonomy of these
   scientific systems, including autonomous scheduling, data processing,
   and Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery methods implemented onboard.
   The implemented autonomy is relatively limited and only answers the
   expected circumstances of one mission. Autonomy is usually implemented
   in the form of separated scripts miming automatically in parallel with
   some communications in between them, but not as autonomous adaptive
   operations.
   However, the progress in development of super-pressure balloons, would
   provide access to longer balloon missions, and safe landing technologies
   would help to reuse these platforms and launch them several times. The
   European Stratospheric Balloon Observatory infrastructure (ESBO) is an
   on-going effort to improve the way scientific balloons have been used up
   to now, by creating an autonomous, highly flexible, and reusable
   platform, capable of integrating different instruments, long autonomous
   flights, and frequent launches. The promise of reusability and
   exchangeability of the instruments at the core of ESBO requires a
   flexible design both at hardware and software levels.
   The goal of this paper is to describe the flexible and autonomous
   payload control software developed for ESBO's first prototype, STUDIO,
   and its various elements. The essential elements covered are the
   instrument independent telescope stabilization system based on COTS
   elements, the autonomous and highly flexible science data downlink
   manager, the onboard scheduler, mode-based telescope operations and
   finally, the fault detection, isolation, and recovery routines onboard.
   The software is developed based on an open-source flight software
   framework for space systems and is open-source to benefit the community
   working on similar missions. In addition to the flight software, the
   paper briefly describes the flexible autonomous science pipeline on
   ground, designed to perform arbitrary chain of processing steps based on
   specific type of data received, and the pointing monitoring software.
   Both these web-based elements use web-based tools to enhance remote
   operations in the future.},

Title = {Multi-source global wetland maps combining surface water imagery and
   groundwater constraints},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {189-220},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Many maps of open water and wetlands have been developed based on three
   main methods: (i) compiling national and regional wetland surveys, (ii)
   identifying inundated areas via satellite imagery and (iii) delineating
   wetlands as shallow water table areas based on groundwater modeling.
   However, the resulting global wetland extents vary from 3\% to 21\% of
   the land surface area because of inconsistencies in wetland definitions
   and limitations in observation or modeling systems. To reconcile these
   differences, we propose composite wetland (CW) maps, combining two
   classes of wetlands: (1) regularly flooded wetlands (RFWs) obtained by
   overlapping selected open-water and inundation datasets; and (2)
   groundwater-driven wetlands (GDWs) derived from groundwater modeling
   (either direct or simplified using several variants of the topographic
   index). Wetlands are statically defined as areas with persistent
   near-saturated soil surfaces because of regular flooding or shallow
   groundwater, disregarding most human alterations (potential wetlands).
   Seven CW maps were generated at 15 arcsec resolution (ca. 500m at the
   Equator) using geographic information system (GIS) tools and by
   combining one RFW and different GDW maps. To validate this approach,
   these CW maps were compared with existing wetland datasets at the global
   and regional scales. The spatial patterns were decently captured, but
   the wetland extents were difficult to assess compared to the dispersion
   of the validation datasets. Compared with the only regional dataset
   encompassing both GDWs and RFWs, over France, the CW maps performed well
   and better than all other considered global wetland datasets. Two CW
   maps, showing the best overall match with the available evaluation
   datasets, were eventually selected. These maps provided global wetland
   extents of 27.5 and 29 million km(2), i.e., 21.1\% and 21.6\% of the
   global land area, which are among the highest values in the literature
   and are in line with recent estimates also recognizing the contribution
   of GDWs. This wetland class covers 15\% of the global land area compared
   with 9.7\% for RFW (with an overlap of ca. 3.4 \%), including wetlands
   under canopy and/or cloud cover, leading to high wetland densities in
   the tropics and small scattered wetlands that cover less than 5\% of
   land but are highly important for hydrological and ecological
   functioning in temperate to arid areas. By distinguishing the RFWs and
   GDWs based globally on uniform principles, the proposed dataset might be
   useful for large-scale land surface modeling (hydrological, ecological
   and biogeochemical modeling) and environmental planning. The dataset
   consisting of the two selected CW maps and the contributing GDW and RFW
   maps is available from PANGAEA at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.892657

Abstract = {Procedures for automated predictive thematic mapping were developed and
   applied to project areas totaling more than 3 million ha of forested
   land in British Columbia, Canada. The effective scale of mapping was
   1:20,000 using data at a grid resolution of 25 in. The methods can be
   described as a form of automated feature extraction or object
   recognition where the objects of interest consist of ecological site
   types. The methods implement a hybrid of automated, semi-automated and
   manual procedures that develop and apply heuristic, rule-based
   conceptual models of ecological-landform relationships. The methods rely
   heavily upon terrain derivatives extracted from available digital
   elevation models (DEMs) in addition to satellite imagery and manually
   digitized maps of ancillary environmental conditions. The primary input
   has been the BC provincial Terrain Resource Information Management
   (TRIM) digital elevation model (DEM) surfaced to a regular grid of 25
   in. Other input layers include manually interpreted maps of parent
   material texture, depth and ecological exception classes, manually
   prepared maps of the spatial distribution of ecological zones of the BC
   Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system and, to a limited
   extent, LandSat7 digital satellite imagery. The procedures do not use
   any field sampling to develop or train classification rules. A
   knowledge-based approach is used to establish classification rules which
   are defined and implemented using a Semantic Import (SI) Model
   implementation of fuzzy logic. All rules are constructed by examining
   and deconstructing published field guides that define the required
   ecological output classes and that document the current expert
   understanding of the conditions and criteria that control the spatial
   distribution of these desired output classes. An iterative, trial and
   error, process is used to develop, apply, evaluate and revise object
   recognition rules that relate ranges of values of key input data layers
   to an expert-assigned likelihood of occurrence for each ecological class
   of interest. Local expert knowledge is used at each stage to evaluate
   each new set of output results and to guide refinement of the fuzzy SI
   model classification rules. Field sample observations obtained along
   randomly selected closed traverses were collected following a line
   intercept approach and used to assess the accuracy of the final
   predictions of ecological classification. Application of the procedures
   has progressed from an initial pilot project through projects to
   evaluate operational scale-up to full-scale commercial application to
   millions of hectares. Costs have been reduced from a high of \$3.50/ha
   to less than \$0.20/ha. Rates of progress increased from 150,000 ha per
   person year to more than 2.0 million ha per person year. Independent
   assessments of map accuracy produced results superior to the highest
   accuracies reported for all alternatives, including traditional manual
   mapping methods. We conclude that we have formalized and automated many
   of the concepts and techniques previously used to create thematic maps
   of ecosystems using manual interpretation of stereo air photos and
   ancillary data combined with field observations. We have shown that
   automated feature extraction is able to capture and apply the concepts
   of landform control referenced by typical landform-based ecological
   models and classification systems.
   We have demonstrated that it is possible to produce accurate and
   cost-effective ecological-landform maps by applying fuzzy and Boolean
   logic and automated landform analysis procedures to idely available
   spatial data. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Purpose We tried to investigate the role of Schwann and satellite cells
   in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction; following
   spinal cord injury in the rabbit model. Methods Twelve male New Zealand
   rabbits underwent induction of neurogenic bladder by spinal cord injury.
   Rabbits underwent the fiber tractography analysis to confirm the
   induction of spinal cord injury. Then, animals were randomly divided
   into two groups. In group I (n = 4), Schwann cells were obtained from
   autologous peroneal nerve. In group II (n = 4), the co-culture of
   nerve-muscle cells was obtained from autologous peroneal nerve and
   quadriceps muscle. Animals in the control group (n = 4) did not undergo
   any rehabilitation therapy. One and 4 months after injection of cells
   into the external anal sphincter, electromyography, urethral pressure
   profiles, urodynamic studies, voiding cystourethrogram, and manometry
   was performed to confirm the efficacy of treatment in short- (1 month)
   and long-term (4 months) follow-ups. Results The investigations
   validated that no statistically significant difference was detected
   between the two experimental groups in a short-term follow-up (p-value >
   0.05). However, the functional features were improved in group II in
   long-term follow-up. In both groups, the external anal sphincter
   contracted in response to electrical signals delivered to the muscle.
   However, more signals were detected in group II in electromyography
   evaluation. The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the
   histological features of the bladder and spinal cord were more
   satisfactory in group II in all follow-ups compared to group I, in terms
   of less edema, inflammation, presence of progenitor cells, and
   expression of muscle and nerve markes. Conclusion Our results suggested
   that the injection of nerve-muscle co-culture cells into the external
   anal sphincter may be a helpful tactic for ameliorating the urological
   complications; following spinal cord injury induction in the rabbit
   model.},

Title = {Optical and Physical Characteristics of Aerosol Layers in Australia
   Based on CALIPSO},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols have important impacts on global radiative forcing,
   air pollution, and human health. This study investigated the optical and
   physical properties of aerosol layers over Australia from 2007 to 2019
   using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite
   Observations (CALIPSO) Level 2 aerosol products. Australia was divided
   into three sub-regions (western highlands, central plains, and eastern
   ranges). Interannual and seasonal optical property variations in aerosol
   layers in the three sub-regions were analyzed and compared. Results
   showed that annual mean values of AOD(L) (lowest aerosol layer AOD) and
   AOD(T) (total AOD of all aerosol layers) were always higher in the
   eastern ranges region than the other two regions from 2007 to 2019. The
   reason could be that Australian population was predominantly located in
   the eastern ranges region, where more human activities could bring
   significant aerosol loadings. B-L (base height of the lowest aerosol
   layer), H-L (top height of the lowest aerosol layer), and H-H (top
   height of the highest aerosol layer) all showed trends of ``western
   highlands > eastern mountains > central plains{''}, indicating that the
   higher the elevation, the higher the B-L, H-L, and H-H. T-L (thickness
   of the lowest aerosol layer) was higher during the day than at night,
   which might account for increased diurnal atmospheric convection and
   nocturnal aerosol deposition. DRL (depolarization ratio of the lowest
   aerosol layer) was higher in the western highlands and central plains
   than the eastern mountains, probably because these two regions have
   large deserts with more irregularly shaped dust aerosols. CRL (color
   ratio of the lowest aerosol layer) had slightly higher values in the
   eastern ranges than the other two regions, probably due to the wet
   climate of the eastern ranges, where aerosols were more hygroscopic and
   had larger particle sizes. This study can provide technical support for
   the control and management of regional air pollutants.},

Title = {Role of sunshades in space as a climate control option},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {241-253},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Placing reflectors in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to
   shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for
   use as a countermeasure against climate change. While the sunshade
   technology has been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoints, no study
   has evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a
   cost-effectiveness viewpoint, presuming that it is used in combination
   with CO2 abatement options as a pillar of the mitigation of climatic
   change. Nor have the contributions of geoengineering research and
   development to the economics of overall climate control measures been
   evaluated. Such evaluations are attempted in this study, which focuses
   on a space-based sunshade technology. As a result, it is recommended
   that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m(2) through the sunshades
   over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the
   21st century. In this case, an increase in global CO2 emissions by some
   15\% is allowed in the former half of the 21st century, and the total
   climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US\$ on a
   present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshades are
   unavailable. To enjoy the above advantages, the mass of the sunshade
   stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a
   doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration should be lower than 100
   Mt/2xCO(2) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing
   (space-launching) sunshades from 6000 to 1000 US\$/kg over a
   half-century. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A reliable weather forecast is the service that the general public
   demands more frequently from the various National Weather Services. A
   better forecast will enable users to take better decisions in situations
   where their lives or properties may be at risk, or in planning everyday
   activities or leisure activities. The governments, in turn, must design
   risk management programs including an alert chain that will make it
   possible to warn the general public, and the first step in this chain is
   a weather forecast as accurate as possible. Severe storms and the
   weather phenomena associated to them - intense precipitation, lightning,
   strong winds, severe hail - are among the most common and dangerous
   weather risks in many European countries, and they also represent one of
   the most widely studied events.
   In general, the development of convective events leading to storms
   requires a favorable synoptic environment (usually a low or trough), in
   addition to three ingredients that characterize the physical mechanisms
   involved convection: atmospheric instability, a sufficiently deep and
   moist layer in the low and mid-troposphere, and a triggering mechanism.
   This mechanism usually consists in convergence at low levels, forced
   updrafts due to the topography, or high temperatures that activate
   convective lifting. It is difficult to detect the triggering mechanism
   using exclusively these data, since these mechanisms are generally
   detected more easily using also data from numerical models.
   The three ingredients must appear at the same time and their interaction
   will determine the likelihood of convection beginning and developing.
   So, if the aim is to establish the likelihood of storms, a number of
   parameters must be known to detect and quantify these three factors.
   These parameters are usually obtained from soundings that provide
   information on the preconvective conditions required from a
   thermodynamic perspective in the low and mid-troposphere to trigger
   convection in the study zone. These data enable us to set up short-term
   discriminant statistical models to determine the likelihood of
   convective events on a particular day.
   The advantage of using this type of forecast model is that the
   information provided by a limited number of variables or weather
   indices, which are all relatively easily obtained (from sounding
   balloons, radiosoundings based on numerical models or satellites), may
   be used to construct models with Probabilities of Detection of over 85\%
   and False Alarm Ratios of less than 20\%. Many of these models have been
   widely used and validated by the scientific community. The main source
   of uncertainties lies in the space-time representativeness of the values
   of the parameters obtained by the sounding. Many studies are carried out
   today on this representativeness.
   It must be kept in mind that it would not be possible to improve a
   short-term forecast without exact data on the ground truth that enable
   us to locate these events in time and space with great accuracy.
   Today the data of these profiles may be obtained with higher temporal
   and spatial resolutions using numerical models or satellite data, so it
   is now possible to overcome some of the limitations, especially the ones
   related to representativeness. This fact will certainly make it possible
   to develop new forecast models, not only to predict convection, but also
   the type or intensity of the convection, and these models will be very
   useful for weather forecasters.
   Finally, some current studies have shown that including sounding data in
   mesoscale weather models improves short-term and mid-term storm
   forecasts, with respect to their location in time and space and
   especially to the data on accumulated precipitation.},

Abstract = {Psoriasis is a chronic, disabling disease in which adherence to
   treatment is often poor. The aim of this article is to highlight the
   problem of adherence to long-term treatment in psoriasis and the factors
   that contribute to it, and to discuss how adherence, and thus outcomes,
   can be improved. This article is based on a presentation given by the
   authors at a satellite symposium held during the 19th Congress of the
   European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, 6-10 October, 2010, in
   Gothenburg, Sweden. Adherence to topical medication is a major problem
   in psoriasis. Not only are prescriptions not being filled by patients
   (primary adherence) but topical medications are not being used as
   recommended (secondary adherence). The issue is complex due to the many
   factors which affect adherence, including efficacy, ease of use and
   convenience of application, and the healthcare professional-patient
   relationship. Due to the nature of the disease, patients suffer poor
   self-image and feel stigmatized, particularly when psoriasis is present
   on a visible part of the body. Consequently, the negative impact of
   psoriasis on patient quality of life underlies many adherence issues. It
   is therefore important for treatment to address the psychological
   aspects as well as the physical symptoms of psoriasis. Improvements in
   several areas of disease management may lead to benefits in medication
   adherence and hence clinical benefit. Prescribing therapy in line with
   patient preference for treatment vehicle and improving the healthcare
   professional-patient relationship may be key factors. Nurses have an
   important role in educating patients and delivering long-term care. This
   individualized, personal, approach may help improve treatment adherence,
   outcomes, and the quality of life for patients with psoriasis.},

Abstract = {The people of northwestern Alaska have had a long relationship with
   local populations of Rangifer tarandus. During the last 200 years this
   relationship has changed from one of subsistence to overexploitation of
   caribou (the name for wild reindeer in North America), to commercial
   livestock production of semi domesticated reindeer and now may be
   returning to a subsistence economy based on caribou. Reindeer were
   introduced to Alaska in 1892 because of the disappearance of caribou, a
   subsistence resource. Until recently, reindeer meat and velvet antler
   production generated significant employment and revenue important to the
   economies of rural Alaskan communities. However, from 1976 to 1996 the
   Western Arctic Caribou Herd (WACH) increased from about 75,000 to
   463,000 animals. Concurrently, winter range use of the WACH shifted
   westward onto traditional reindeer ranges of the Seward Peninsula for
   the first time in over 100 years. This event has produced socio-economic
   and ecological consequences for the region. Many reindeer herders have
   lost 75-100 percent of their herds through commingling and out-migration
   with wild caribou. This loss, amounting to over 17,000 reindeer,
   represents a potential economic value of millions of dollars. Many
   herders have adopted new technologies, such as satellite telemetry and
   intensive herding to salvage what is left of their herds. Here we
   discuss the role of grazing animals and patterns of human resource use
   in an Arctic system. We then discuss our findings on the effects and
   changes in management practices brought about by caribou incursion in
   the context of the regional economy on the Seward Peninsula.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and surface runoff are the two most important components, which
   control the groundwater recharge of the basin. The long-term groundwater
   recharge of an aquifer gets affected by the population growth, irregular
   agriculture activities and industrialization. Hence, estimation of
   rainfall-surface runoff is very much essential for proper groundwater
   management practices. In the present study, Soil Conservation Service
   Curve Number (SCS-CN) model was employed in combination with geospatial
   techniques to estimate rainfall-surface runoff for the Lower Bhavani
   River basin in South India. To develop the SCS-CN model, rainfall data
   were obtained for 33 years (1983-2015) from 22 rain gauge stations
   spread over the basin. IRS LISS-IV satellite data of 5.8 m spatial
   resolution were used to analyze the land use/land cover (LU/LC)
   behavior. Based on the soil properties, four Hydrological Soil Groups
   (HSG) were identified in the basin which is most significant for surface
   runoff estimation. Curve Number (CN) values were obtained for various
   Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) such as dry condition (AMC I),
   average condition (AMC II) and wet condition (AMC III). Spatial
   distribution of CN values was plotted using Geographical Information
   System (GIS) for the entire Lower Bhavani Basin to assess the surface
   runoff potential. The results indicate that the annual rainfall varies
   from 267 mm (2002) to 1528.6 mm (2005), and the annual surface runoff
   varies from 102.04 mm (1985) to 463.02 mm (2010). The SCS-CN model
   outputs predict that the average surface runoff of the basin is 211.99
   mm, and the average surface runoff volume is 81,995,380 m(3). The study
   also indicates that nearly 53\% of the basin area is dominated by high
   to very high surface runoff potential. Finally, the output of surface
   runoff potential was validated with the Average Groundwater Level
   Fluctuation (AGLF) observed in 57 wells spread over the entire basin.
   The basin AGLF ranges from 2.32 to 21.72 m. The surface runoff potential
   categories are satisfactorily matching with the AGLF categories.
   Moderate surface runoff as well as moderate AGLF zones mostly occupy the
   central portion of the basin, which possess good groundwater potential.
   However, the high surface runoff zones in the basin lead more surface
   water flow into the river channels, which reduce the infiltration rate
   and decline the water table. This problem can be solved by constructing
   suitable artificial groundwater recharge structures across the river
   channels in the high surface runoff potential areas.},

Title = {MRLs of concern for the active substance vinclozolin},
Journal = {EFSA JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The European Commission requested EFSA to provide an opinion on the
   safety of the existing MRLs of vinclozolin without specifying the actual
   MRLs of concern. In order to focus the assessment mainly on the MRLs
   that are of concern, EFSA decided to follow a tiered approach which
   resulted into the following conclusions and recommendations.
   The existing EC MRLs for scarole, kiwi, table grapes, peppers, melons,
   lettuce, watermelons, apples, currants, witloof, pears, strawberries,
   aubergines, Chinese cabbage, plums, apricots and wine grapes were
   identified as the MRLs of concern as the calculated acute exposure
   amounted more than 100\% of the ARFD. Additionally, acute concerns were
   also identified for 3 processed commodities: grape juice, kiwi and
   currant juices.
   In the chronic intake assessment potential consumer risks were
   identified for 26 diets out of the 27 diets available. The calculated
   TMDI for these populations ranged between to 110 \% and 644 \% of the
   ADI. However, this screening is expected to overestimate the real
   situation with regard to consumer exposure and further refinements for
   these MRLs of concern were therefore undertaken.
   The active substance vinclozolin was subject to the peer review under
   Directive 91/414/EEC (list 1). Vinclozolin was not included in Annex I
   because no decision for inclusion/non inclusion in Annex I has been
   taken by the deadline of 31/12/2006 for finalization of the review
   programme for substances in list 1. Therefore, the use of vinclozolin on
   any crop grown in Europe was formally no longer authorised starting 1
   January 2007. Nevertheless, considering any period of grace possibly
   granted at Member State level, treated commodities resulting from those
   uses might have circulated on the European market still after 1 January
   2007. However, it is considered that to date no crops should be on the
   EU market with residue of vinclozolin arising from EU uses of this
   active substance.
   EFSA proposed to withdraw the MRLs for scarole, watermelons, apples,
   pears, aubergines, Chinese cabbage, plums, apricots, peas (without pods
   - fresh), carrots, peas (dry), shallots, spring onions, pumpkins, peas
   (with pods - fresh), okra, lamb's lettuce, cress, land cress, rocket,
   red mustard, leaves and sprouts of Brassica as the use on these food
   commodities is not authorised in Europe and as no CXLs are in place. A
   new MRL, corresponding to the LOQ (0.05 mg/kg), was therefore proposed
   by EFSA.
   For the following crops, EFSA proposed to withdraw the MRLs because the
   use in Europe on those crops is not authorised and because a risk for
   consumers could not be excluded if the data supporting the CXLs are
   considered: table grapes, melons, lettuce, currants, witloof and
   strawberries.
   For the following crops, EFSA proposed to withdraw the MRLs because the
   use in Europe on those crops are not authorised and because the existing
   CXLs were set on the basis of European GAPs which are no longer
   supported: peppers, beans (with pods - fresh), hops and rape seeds.
   Finally, EFSA recommend maintaining the MRL for kiwi (for varieties with
   inedible peel) and wine grapes as, after the refinement of the acute
   consumer exposure, risk to the consumers' health could be excluded.
   Considering these proposals, which are summarized in the following
   table, the acute intake calculations resulted in exposure levels below
   the toxicological reference values. The chronic intake slightly exceeds
   the ADI for one diet, but this is mainly attributed to MRLs at the LOQ
   value.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to develop a methodological approach to the
   problem of a quantitative assessment of the technical level (technical
   excellence) of geostationary telecommunication satellites (GTS). The
   technical level indicator is a quantitative measure for assessing the
   perfection of the design of a product and the quality of products
   (services) produced with its use. This is an important technical and
   economic indicator of experimental design work. The value of the
   technical level indicator is one of the determining factors in the
   competitiveness of the created space system. The paper discusses the
   existing methodological approaches to the quantitative assessment of the
   technical level of science-intensive and technically complex products.
   We present a new approach to determine the composition of technical
   performance markers for calculating the GTS technical level indicator
   allowing a formal description of the beneficial effect and a logical
   scheme for quantifying the technical level. The methodological approach
   to calculate the degree of influence of technical efficiency indicators
   on the value of the beneficial effect of the use of GTS is stated as
   well. It is based on a mathematical model of the hierarchy analysis
   introduced by T Saaty, complemented by us with mathematical models for
   the best consideration of GTS technical features. It allowed us to
   ensure control of errors and contradictions in expert judgments involved
   in the preparation of initial data of =measurable or hardly measurable
   techno-economic indicators of GTS. Due to the higher level of
   formalization of the process of quantifying the technical level and the
   application of mathematical methods used in modern decision theory, the
   developed methodological approach serves to improve the quality of
   calculations significantly and to reduce the influence of the subjective
   factor in determining the value of the technical level indicator. Based
   on the above, we developed a method for quantitative assessment of the
   GTS technical level that meets the modern requirements.},

Title = {Report of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and

Year = {2018},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This report continues the practice where the IAU Working Group on
   Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements revises recommendations
   regarding those topics for the planets, satellites, minor planets, and
   comets approximately every 3 years. The Working Group has now become a
   ``functional working group{''} of the IAU, and its membership is open to
   anyone interested in participating. We describe the procedure for
   submitting questions about the recommendations given here or the
   application of these recommendations for creating a new or updated
   coordinate system for a given body. Regarding body orientation, the
   following bodies have been updated: Mercury, based on MESSENGER results;
   Mars, along with a refined longitude definition; Phobos; Deimos; (1)
   Ceres; (52) Europa; (243) Ida; (2867) Steins; Neptune; (134340) Pluto
   and its satellite Charon; comets 9P/Tempel 1, 19P/Borrelly,
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and 103P/Hartley 2, noting that such
   information is valid only between specific epochs. The special
   challenges related to mapping 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are also
   discussed. Approximate expressions for the Earth have been removed in
   order to avoid confusion, and the low precision series expression for
   the Moon's orientation has been removed. The previously online only
   recommended orientation model for (4) Vesta is repeated with an
   explanation of how it was updated. Regarding body shape, text has been
   included to explain the expected uses of such information, and the
   relevance of the cited uncertainty information. The size of the Sun has
   been updated, and notation added that the size and the ellipsoidal axes
   for the Earth and Jupiter have been recommended by an IAU Resolution.
   The distinction of a reference radius for a body (here, the Moon and
   Titan) is made between cartographic uses, and for orthoprojection and
   geophysical uses. The recommended radius for Mercury has been updated
   based on MESSENGER results. The recommended radius for Titan is returned
   to its previous value. Size information has been updated for 13 other
   Saturnian satellites and added for Aegaeon. The sizes of Pluto and
   Charon have been updated. Size information has been updated for (1)
   Ceres and given for (16) Psyche and (52) Europa. The size of (25143)
   Itokawa has been corrected. In addition, the discussion of terminology
   for the poles (hemispheres) of small bodies has been modified and a
   discussion on cardinal directions added. Although they continue to be
   used for planets and their satellites, it is assumed that the
   planetographic and planetocentric coordinate system definitions do not
   apply to small bodies. However, planetocentric and planetodetic
   latitudes and longitudes may be used on such bodies, following the
   right-hand rule. We repeat our previous recommendations that planning
   and efforts be made to make controlled cartographic products; newly
   recommend that common formulations should be used for orientation and
   size; continue to recommend that a community consensus be developed for
   the orientation models of Jupiter and Saturn; newly recommend that
   historical summaries of the coordinate systems for given bodies should
   be developed, and point out that for planets and satellites
   planetographic systems have generally been historically preferred over
   planetocentric systems, and that in cases when planetographic
   coordinates have been widely used in the past, there is no obvious
   advantage to switching to the use of planetocentric coordinates.
   The Working Group also requests community input on the question
   submitting process, posting of updates to the Working Group website, and
   on whether recommendations should be made regarding exoplanet coordinate
   systems.},

Title = {USING GEOSTATISTICS IN FOREST MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {SUMARSKI LIST},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {134},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {249-259},
Abstract = {The possibilities of forest measurements have been significantly
   improved nowadays, by using georeferenced maps, implementing remote
   sensing, developing artificial intelligence, using the global
   positioning system and geographical information system. Moreover the
   exact position (x, y) of the measurement (of variables) of the specific
   location (Z) in the forest allows the monitoring of the information and
   the analysis of the so called continuous model of spatial variation, as
   opposed to the discrete model of spatial variation which is assumed to
   be homogeneous.
   Ever since geostatistics was introduced to geoscinces (Krige 1951,
   Matheron 1965), it has been implemented in many areas whose interest
   lies in analyzing spatial data. Geostatistics is based on the concept of
   regionalized variable (which means that the value of the variable
   depends on the sampling area).
   The goal was research and presentation of using geostatistics in the
   forest management, with the aim of improving the present approach to
   using and mapping the forest inventory data for Croatia. The
   geostatistical analysis was performed on apart of an management unit
   ``Banov Brod{''}, Pitomaca forestry administration, for three structural
   elements (variables): number of trees (N), basal area (G) and volume
   (V). The research included the compartments /sub-compartments 9a, d, e,
   10 a, b (Figure 1), with the total area of 69, 57 ha.
   In order to determine the anisotropy, semivariogram surface maps of each
   of the elements were made. The semivariograms were used as a measure of
   spatial dependence, and experimental and theoretical semivariograms were
   calculated. The experimental semivariogram for each structural element
   was calculated after multiple fitting of number and width of lags. The
   parameters used for Ordinary Kringing interpolation of each of the
   structural elements were obtained from the theoretical semivariogram
   model.
   The interpolation of structural elements was also conducted by using the
   inverse distance method. The testing of the interpolation model was done
   by using a numeric cross-validation approach. Furthermore, the
   usefulness of making a variogram cloud in the spatial structural
   elements' analysis was shown. Three programs were used during this
   project: VARIOWIN 2.21; SURFER 8.0 (TM), and STATISTICA 7.1 (TM).
   Semivariogram surface maps for the three analyzed structural elements
   did not indicate the presence of anisotropy (Figure 2). As anisotropy
   was not determined and omnidirectional experimental semivariogram were
   calculated (Figure 3). All experimental semivariograms can be considered
   reliable because they contain a great number of pairs of data. What they
   have in common is the existence of hardly explainable high nugget, that
   is the difference in the values of close samples or measurement errors,
   as well as the range, which is bigger than the sampling interval. The
   omnidirectional experimental semivariogram of the tree volume and basal
   area (Figures 3a, b) start oscillating very soon, which shows that there
   is no large range of these two structural elements in any direction. The
   omnidirectional experimental semivariogram of the number of trees
   increases relatively quickly so this structural element shows the
   poorest spatial correlation (Figure 3c). The omnidirectional
   experimental semivariogram is approximated with the theoretical (Table
   2, Figure 3). Sample distribution maps (Figures 4, 5 and 6) show an
   estimated value of structural elements on either coordinates (x, y).
   Structural elements' assessments through kriging and inverse distance
   method are tested with cross-validation and a root mean square error was
   used as an accuracy benchmark (Table 4). The mean square errors of
   assessment methods are very similar and therefore inconclusive when
   determining which interpolation method is more acceptable. Thus, a
   testing of the value differences between the measured data and
   interpolation methods for the three structural elements (number of
   trees, basal area and volume) was done by using the analysis of variance
   of repeated measurements. As visible in Table 5, statistically
   significant difference between the measurement data and interpolation
   methods of kriging and inverse distance was not determined.
   During the assessment of structural elements' value (Figures 7, 8, 9) it
   is visible that the kriging assessment is more compatible with range of
   measurement values for all three structural elements, while inverse
   distance method measurements have a significantly lower value range (in
   other words model cells assessment tend to be around the mean value of
   incoming data). Consequently, this research considers kriging as the
   acceptable interpolation method when compared to inverse distance
   method.
   The making of semivariogram cloud is a useful tool because it allows the
   observation of each variable (structural element) as a distance function
   (shown on the x-axis) between measured data (variogram values between
   pairs are shown on the y-axis) within the analyzed area (view of the
   forest are with locations where measurements were done) on an
   interactive interface.
   In geostatistics the size of area and variable is not a limiting
   element. Any variable obtained through forest inventory, by tree type or
   total, can be observed by using a geostatistical analysis. The only
   condition is that some form of autocorrelation is assumed between them.
   Since forest inventory is conducted periodically, the geostatistical
   method which allows the possibility of monitoring forests in space
   (spatial structure), also allows monitoring forests in time. The changes
   of variable(s) in space and time (change of structural elements' values
   by tree type and total, health of forests, etc.), as well as the forest
   management itself can thus be monitored by continuously mapping two or
   more successive measurements. In addition, the above mentioned approach
   also enables the control of forest measurements.
   By doing the forest inventory, a lot of information is gathered on the
   state of forests. Geomathematical tools (geostatistical and neural)

Abstract = {Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act
   (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of
   them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide
   range of health services, including prevention and public health
   promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the
   Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public
   health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social
   workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some
   changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained.
   According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located
   with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the
   European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which
   otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the
   last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have
   recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of
   patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of
   these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting
   older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity
   would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but
   actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too.
   Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper
   care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the
   challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of
   collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is
   secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality
   per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a
   care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and
   secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national
   guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need
   more in the future is more research on new practices and models.
   Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not
   achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful
   hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of
   addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the
   quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication?
   Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was
   conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland,
   randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites
   (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed
   antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication
   in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist,
   filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The
   treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group
   without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were
   included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n =
   59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When
   initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19\% of the
   patients in the control group and for 68\% in the intervention group.
   Shortly after the appointment, only 14\% of the patients in the control
   group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32\%
   in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to
   more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64\% in the
   control group vs 95\% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even
   highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have
   significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a
   checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to
   substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use
   of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new
   antihypertensive medications.
   Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical
   education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation.
   Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and
   assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP)
   trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018,
   trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data
   about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of
   recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information
   about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of
   satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of
   their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44
   of them 65.7\% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings
   and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5\%)
   refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording
   with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it
   possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their
   achievements. `Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the
   most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was
   the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in
   favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion:
   Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs
   to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This
   teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication
   skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence
   near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It
   could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the
   place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could
   also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.
   Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric
   morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the
   prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of
   women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic
   and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including
   sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are
   associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi
   Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
   (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs)
   were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical,
   lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive
   symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women
   who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3\%) were classified as having peripartum
   depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant
   medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab
   background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and
   age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal
   depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the
   periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs.
   Incidences of depression were 17.4\% in women with a history of
   antidepressant medication, 16\% among women with diabetes, and 11.8\%
   among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and
   lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among
   women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without.
   Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy
   may help identify women in need of support.
   Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of
   general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the
   Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund
   through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of
   this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions
   used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative
   research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions.
   This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general
   practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them
   responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared
   test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is
   qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general
   practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102
   were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most
   general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49
   years. The participants' age had a significant influence on
   sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438
   participants, 33.3\% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7\%
   general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned
   significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that
   worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were
   significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons
   for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals
   above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification
   of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education.
   `Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction:
   49.8\% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who
   were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently.
   Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the
   workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.
   Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies,
   reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of
   the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial.
   According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is
   a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a
   scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests
   the term `effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed
   studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We
   updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE.
   Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3,
   2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and
   August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword `Hawthorne
   Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of
   an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles
   defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without
   defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent
   readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by
   consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All
   the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant
   or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods
   and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in
   time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or
   indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their
   previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and
   to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting.
   Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis
   is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of
   the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its
   implication as an experimental artefact.
   Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise.
   Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of
   multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health
   outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such
   patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming.
   Recent eHealth tools, such as the `systematic tool to reduce
   inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for
   GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research
   question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help
   GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid
   patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled
   trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10
   patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic
   medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of
   using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to
   usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria
   (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth
   setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their
   electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are
   followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness
   is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and
   fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients'
   willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and
   enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient
   recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the
   study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software
   in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP
   assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid
   patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on
   the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss
   primary care in this new eHealth environment.
   Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is
   becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide.
   Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions.
   How often it happened towards young doctors working as general
   practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely
   studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of
   WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and
   violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The
   cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their
   postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed
   anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians
   of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and
   forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself
   and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9\%,
   female 87\%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of
   the residents were working in an urban practice (63\%), others in the
   rural and the suburban once (27\%, 10\%). All GP residents experienced
   patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them.
   High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was
   experienced by 44\%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual
   harassment) by 84\% while all residents experienced verbal violence.
   Only 13.2\% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most
   of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the
   one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of
   violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact
   that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions.
   Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.
   Background: About 50\% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France.
   Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's
   difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because
   there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How
   can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient
   compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate
   scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic
   review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO
   databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the
   database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All
   articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection
   criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability
   of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One
   reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then
   abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development,
   validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were
   included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and
   18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in
   primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially
   hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication
   adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple
   chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65
   years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two
   scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the
   instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic
   adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been
   developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with
   multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by
   Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale
   would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence:
   motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE
   protocol.
   Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining
   quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research
   question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between
   increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently
   occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe
   how these associations differ across different European countries and
   regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of
   the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe
   (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+
   years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined
   as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were
   self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire
   containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by
   participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure
   questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between
   increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear
   regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of
   diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis
   will take into account differences between countries and regions.
   Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and
   included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits,
   social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants
   (49.09\%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per
   person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis
   showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95\%CI: -1.29, -1.24)
   with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be
   the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95\%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in
   Israel, -0.67 (95\%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will
   identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as
   well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between
   increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.
   Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically
   estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs
   often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall
   burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research
   questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which
   multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what
   extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension
   and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and
   NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free
   participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective
   Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes,
   chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We
   quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a
   competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking,
   hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy.
   Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were
   diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004
   with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with
   neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7\%) were
   diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the
   age of 45 onwards was 94.0\% (95\%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8\%
   (95\%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was
   associated with a 9.0-year delay (95\%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset
   of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants
   without risk factors was 6.0 years (95\%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those
   with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent
   21.6\% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8\% for
   those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45
   years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining
   lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up.
   Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of
   morbidity of NCDs.
   Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases
   the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following
   visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic
   reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research
   question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in
   improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how:
   financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational
   retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried
   out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient
   chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The
   quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the
   intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of
   diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of
   recording diagnoses was about 40\% in the primary care units. After four
   years, the recording rate had risen to 90\% (p < 0.001). The rate of
   change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year
   of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild
   respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type
   II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording
   of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced
   data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life
   in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.
   Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and
   communities and remains undiscovered in 90\% of the cases. In total,
   80\% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the
   Netherlands, at least 3\% (118 000) of children are victims of child
   abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3\% of abuse cases are
   reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services
   agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs'
   experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion
   of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon
   their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their
   management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four
   focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different
   levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the
   Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results:
   Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling
   that `something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by
   gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They
   often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because
   parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and
   differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual
   abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases
   they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most
   GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the
   risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate
   by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients'
   trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other
   professionals.
   Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic
   conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is
   known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts,
   especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing
   number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life
   (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific
   patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among
   patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to
   measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research
   question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with
   multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM
   for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize
   the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to
   measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity
   of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus
   group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant
   QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft
   questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with
   multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft
   questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement
   quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients
   with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results:
   There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under
   development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with
   multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's
   number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no
   statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL
   among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated
   PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of
   QoL among patients with multimorbidity.
   Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and
   qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners
   Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive
   definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the
   biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more
   than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care.
   Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute
   hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk
   factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity.
   Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity
   could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e.
   decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up?
   Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's
   multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of
   inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status
   `decompensation' or `nothing to report' was collected. A logistic
   regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival
   analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months
   follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were
   identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6\% of the population,
   had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days.
   Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number
   of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and
   total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039).
   Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid
   outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters
   or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others
   in medical literature.
   Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family
   medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and
   Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the
   20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the
   observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods:
   Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia
   recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure
   using electronic medical records based on the International
   Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the
   doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of
   care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of
   both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in
   one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family
   practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint
   top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations
   were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds
   ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological
   gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the
   causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the
   observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to
   assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family
   medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent
   with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most
   observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness
   diversity.
   Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning
   of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was
   then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic
   model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected
   the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess
   therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to
   translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to
   assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations.
   Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous
   between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods:
   Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating
   countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi
   procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing
   the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP
   teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of
   the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the
   assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A
   consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the
   `homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original
   version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage
   permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation
   issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions
   of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be
   helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in
   daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training,
   and for further research in these five countries.
   Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established
   patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a
   GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient
   immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to
   evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a
   single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the
   PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre
   patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with
   brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before
   and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview
   two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures
   were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and
   negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with
   different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients
   with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations
   between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively.
   Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive
   value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The
   reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2.
   Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure
   patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but
   it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement
   scores.
   Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research,
   which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science
   approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important
   shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct
   might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health
   services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now.
   There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations
   for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as
   polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these
   recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also
   help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health
   services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that
   `intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different
   challenges to researchers and health services compared to `active
   psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but
   tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward.
   This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and
   illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas
   where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care
   design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more
   coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve
   medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.
   These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also
   the scale.
   Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases
   (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over
   time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health
   and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to
   describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and
   polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients
   in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care
   sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR)
   database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records.
   Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of
   >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of
   Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified
   using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the
   Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses
   will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The
   prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be
   presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and
   older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and
   permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented,
   stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other
   factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health
   service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to
   identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy
   in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This
   research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
   mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These
   findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to
   contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
   the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed
   medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the
   context of multimorbidity.
   Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for
   general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate
   medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains
   challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from
   guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among
   patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify
   barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with
   polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with
   multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular
   medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of
   whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and
   chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards
   deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions
   and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards
   deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so
   far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants
   were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48\% female. Thirty-one percent
   lived alone, and 85\% prepared their medication themselves, all others
   required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular
   medicines and 24\% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76\%)
   were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78\% did
   not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were
   not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers
   to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96\%), long-term drugs
   (56\%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92\%). When it
   comes to deprescribing, 89\% of participants wanted as much information
   as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP
   was a further key factor to them (85\%). Conclusion: Most older adults
   are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their
   medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared
   decision-making with the GP they trust.
   Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity,
   general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice
   are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need'
   patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to
   automatically create a list of possible `high need' patients could be a
   quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients.
   Research question: Can `high need' patients with multimorbidity be
   identified automatically from their primary care medical records?
   Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity
   (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel
   primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely
   recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare
   use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was
   conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general
   practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were
   age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication
   use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were
   identified, of which 48\% were above the age of 65 and 57\% female. More
   than 42\% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62\% used five
   or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general
   practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts
   in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including
   specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the
   model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for
   ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC:
   0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: `High need' patients with
   multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical
   records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in
   the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to
   identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.
   Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow
   progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity
   patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying
   pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is
   necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies.
   Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which
   longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up?
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health
   records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people
   aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes
   for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied
   for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis
   to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their
   progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted,
   estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2)
   the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each
   individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected
   ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP.
   Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total,
   916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster
   including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific
   (42.0\% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the
   following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases
   (19.3\%), osteometabolic (7.9\%), cardio-circulatory (6.6\%), and
   others. Most patients, minimum 59.2\%, remained in the same cluster
   during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state
   were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1\%) and nervous (31.8\%)
   MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The
   application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the
   study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method
   is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.
   Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative
   surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed
   on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the
   creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to
   determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected
   quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the
   general population. Research question: What is the best possible
   reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general
   population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to
   April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA
   (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses)
   protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for
   each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or
   those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values
   were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected
   articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's
   coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency
   data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36,
   SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the
   SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to
   0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully
   validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and
   Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most
   validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and
   clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality
   of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the
   one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as
   no external validity is available.
   Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection
   among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies
   if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question:
   This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of
   type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An
   HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test
   during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an
   infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test.
   We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to
   those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer,
   receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment,
   anaemia less than 9 mg\%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637
   patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September
   2017. The following information was collected: age, gender,
   socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication
   in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA,
   CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In
   total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c
   test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and
   sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection
   (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression
   analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of
   infection between 29 and 60\%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c
   increased the risk by 8.5\%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the
   infection increases the chance of infection by 734\%. Conclusion:
   Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection
   among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much
   more significant risk factor.},

Abstract = {The developments taking place in Information Technology (IT),
   particularly, the convergence between computers and communication has
   made the world a global village.  Indeed competitive advantage would be
   primarily determined by a nation's or firm's IT infrastructure.  This is
   all the more compelling in the context of our economic reforms programme
   where India is all set to get plugged into the global economy.  The
   shift from analogue to digital technology has brought a major transition
   which has completely altered the communications landscape.  `'anytime
   anywhere'' communications based on mobile cellular, satellite and
   Personal Communication System (PCS) technologies are fast becoming a
   global reality.  This coupled with the development of `'Information
   Superhighways'' based on optical fibre is making the integration of
   voice, data and video available through the Integrated Services Digital
   Network.  While wireless and optical fibre based local loops loom on the
   horizon, `the last mile problem' has resulted in the amalgamation of
   major switching and cable networks in the USA, in order to bring
   multimedia to tomorrow's home.  It is anticipated that several of these
   possibilities would become commonplace by the year 2000 and in this
   context it is extremely important that developing countries like our
   own, chalk out strategies in order to leapfrog technologies in the most
   cost effective manner with a view to successfully managing the
   tremendous changes underway.
   The output of global electronics reached \$700 billion in 1990 and is
   expected to reach about \$1.3 trillion by the year 2000.  The value
   added by the electronics industry is growing at about 6 per cent per
   year, compared with about 3.8 per cent for all manufacturing industries
   and 3.1 per cent for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (all in real terms). 
   At this pace by the year 2000 electronics will account for about 4 per
   cent of world GDP and 14 per cent of value added in manufacturing.  In
   comparison, the Indian electronics industry reached an output level of a
   little over \$ 4 billion in 1992 representing 0.7 per cent of the global
   electronics industry.  If India were to achieve a production level of \$
   20 billion by the year 2000, this would increase to 1.5 per cent.
   In the context of the next decade China whose current electronics output
   is almost 3 times that of India provides a very useful point of
   reference.  What is alarming is the rate at which electronics
   applications are growing in China, in TV, telecom and Information
   Technology (IT).  Thus, China's production of TV sets, both colour and
   Black \& White, is 5 times that of India; it proposes to install over 3
   times the number of telephones by the year 2000; and its IT industry
   currently is also 3 times of India's.  These in turn provide rapidly
   improving economies of scale, when compared to those of the Indian
   electronics industry, thus promoting greater vertical integration,
   increasing cost competitiveness, makes exports more viable and attracts
   greater foreign direct investment and technology to feed its burgeoning
   market.  Consequently, there is an imperative need to provide a
   strategic vision at this juncture to address the Chinese challenge and
   to ensure the future health of the Indian electronics industry
   commensurate with our size and capabilities.
   The background paper provides the current status of the electronics
   industry both nationally as well as internationally and the development
   strategies pursued by different countries.  From these, the major issues
   in devising an appropriate strategy for future development of the Indian
   Electronics Industry are derived.  This is to lay the ground work for
   further deliberation.  The paper is divided into following parts:

Title = {The association between long-term exposure to outdoor artificial light
   at night and poor sleep quality among Chinese veterans: A multi-city
   study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {252},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: A handful of previous studies have reported the association
   between exposure to outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) and sleep
   problems. However, evidence for such association is limited in low- and
   middleincome countries. This study aimed to examine the association
   between outdoor ALAN exposure and sleep quality in veterans across
   different regions of China. Methods: Within the network of the Chinese
   Veteran Clinical Research Platform, we selected 7258 participants from
   277 veteran communities in 18 cities across China during December 2009
   and December 2011, using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling
   strategy. Face-to-face interviews with the participants were conducted
   by trained investigators. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
   (PSQI) to assess participants' sleep quality. We defined poor sleep
   quality as a PSQI global score >7. The 3-year average exposure to
   outdoor ALAN prior to the baseline interview was calculated using
   satellite imagery data, according to participants' geolocation
   information. The association of ALAN exposure with sleep quality was
   examined using the mixed-effects logistic regression models with natural
   cubic splines. Results: The exposure-response curve for sleep quality
   associated with ALAN exposure was nonlinear, with a threshold value of
   49.20 nW/cm2/sr for the 3-year average exposure to outdoor ALAN prior to
   the baseline interview. Higher ALAN exposure above the threshold was
   associated with increased risk of poor sleep quality. After adjusting
   for potential confounders, the odds ratios (and 95\%CI, 95\% confidence
   intervals) were 1.15 (0.97, 1.36) and 1.45 (1.17, 1.78) at the 75th and
   95th percentiles of ALAN against the threshold. The association of ALAN
   exposure with poor sleep quality was more pronounced in veterans with
   depression than those without. Higher OR of poor sleep quality at the
   75th percentile of ALAN against the threshold was observed in veterans
   with depression than those without {[}2.09 (1.16, 3.76) vs. 1.09 (0.92,
   1.30)]. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to outdoor ALAN was associated
   with higher risk of poor sleep quality in Chinese veterans. Effective
   outdoor ALAN management may help to reduce the burden of sleep disorders
   in Chinese veterans.},

Title = {On the Future of Argo: <i>A Global</i>, <i>Full</i>-<i>Depth</i>,

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The Argo Program has been implemented and sustained for almost two
   decades, as a global array of about 4000 profiling floats. Argo provides
   continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus
   pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar. The successful installation
   of the Argo array and its innovative data management system arose
   opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and
   technological innovation. Through the data system, Argo provides
   fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable
   applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of
   autonomous profiling floats. Following recent advances in platform and
   sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years
   ago to (i) improve Argo's global coverage and value beyond the original
   design, (ii) extend Argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add
   biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of
   carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental
   sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document
   the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and
   each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression
   along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to
   global implementation is described. The objective is to create a fully
   global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary Argo
   Program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in
   situ elements of the Global Ocean Observing System (Legler et al.,
   2015). The integrated system will deliver operational reanalysis and
   forecasting capability, and assessment of the state and variability of
   the climate system with respect to physical, biogeochemical, and
   ecosystems parameters. It will enable basic research of unprecedented
   breadth and magnitude, and a wealth of ocean-education and outreach
   opportunities.},

Title = {The influence of spatial patterning on modeling PM<sub>2.5</sub>
   constituents in Eastern Massachusetts},

Abstract = {Geostatistical exposure methods for air pollution have inherent
   uncertainties, resulting in varying levels of exposure
   misclassification. In this study, we propose that areas representing
   dusters of PM2.5 elements are potential predictor variables to be
   included in spatial models for particle composition. The inclusion of
   these clusters may minimize the exposure misclassification. We evaluated
   the influence of spatial patterning on modeling of 10 components of
   ambient PM2.5, which included Al, Cu, Fe, K. Ni. Pb, S, Ti, V, and Zn.
   This study was performed in three stages. First, we applied a hybrid
   approach (combination of Empirical Bayesian Kriging and land use
   regression) to estimate spatial variability for each one of the 10
   components of ambient PM2.5. In this stage, we accounted for numerous
   predictors representing land use, transportation, demographic, and
   geographical characteristics. In the second stage, we applied the same
   hybrid approach adding clusters of each PM2.5 component to the set of
   predictor variables. The clusters here were estimated by a multivariate
   clustering approach based on k means. Finally, in the last stage, we
   compared the estimates obtained from the model without clusters (first
   stage) and the model with clusters (second stage). Overall, our findings
   suggest significant influence of spatial dusters on modeling some PM2.5
   components. We observed that the clusters may affect the error of the
   prediction values and especially the proportion of explained variance
   for most of the PM2.5 constituents evaluated in this study. The model
   with cluster presented a better performance for all PM2.5 components,
   except for Pb. which the R-2 value decreased 8.51\% when we included the
   clusters in the analysis; and for V. which the R-2 value did not change
   with the clusters. Models for Cu and Fe explained the highest
   concentration variance. The R-2 value for the model without cluster was
   0.55 for both pollutants. When we accounted for clusters, R-2 value
   increased 13 and 7\% for Cu (R-2 = 0.62) and Fe (R-2 = 0.59),
   respectively. The models for K and S presented the lowest performance
   for both models with and without cluster (although the model with
   cluster improved substantially the R-2 values). Better knowledge of the
   influence of spatial patterns on air pollution modeling should be of
   interest to policy makers to devise future strategies to improve human
   exposure assessment to air particulates while controlling for spatial
   patterns of ambient PM2.5 elemental concentration. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {Canadian aging and inactivity study: Spaceflight-inspired exercises
   during head-down tilt bedrest blunted reductions in muscle-pump but not
   cardiac baroreflex in older persons},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {As part of the first Canadian aging and inactivity study (CAIS) we
   assessed the efficacy of space-based exercise countermeasures for
   maintenance of cardiac and muscle-pump baroreflex in older persons
   during bedrest. An initiative of the Canadian Space Agency, Canadian
   Institutes of Health Research and the Canadian Frailty Network, CAIS
   involved 14 days of 6-degree head-down tilt bedrest (HDBR) with
   (Exercise) or without (Control) combined upper and lower body strength,
   aerobic, and high-intensity interval training exercise countermeasures.
   Twenty healthy men and women aged 55 to 65, randomly divided into
   control and exercise groups (male control (MC, n = 5), male exercise
   (ME, n = 5), female control (FC, n = 6), female exercise (FE, n = 4))
   (age: 58.7 \& PLUSMN; 0.5 years, height: 1.67 \& PLUSMN; 0.02 m, body
   mass: 70.2 \& PLUSMN; 3.2 kg; mean \& PLUSMN; SEM), completed the study.
   Cardiac and muscle-pump baroreflex activity were assessed with
   supine-to-stand tests. Wavelet transform coherence was used to
   characterise cardiac and muscle-pump baroreflex fraction time active
   (FTA) and gain values, and convergent cross-mapping was used to
   investigate causal directionality between blood pressure (BP) and heart
   rate, as well as BP and lower leg muscle electromyography (EMG). Seven
   of the twenty participants were unable to stand for 6 minutes after
   HDBR, with six of those being female. Our findings showed that 2 weeks
   of bedrest impaired skeletal muscle's ability to return blood to the
   venous circulation differently across various sexes and intervention
   groups. Comparing values after bed rest with before bed rest values,
   there was a significant increase in heart rates ( increment of +25\%;
   +17\% in MC to +33\% in FC; p < 0.0001), beat-to-beat EMG decreased (
   increment of -43\%; -25\% in ME to -58\% in MC; p < 0.02), while BP
   change was dependent on sex and intervention groups. Unlike their male
   counterparts, in terms of muscle-pump baroreflex, female participants
   had considerably decreased FTA after HDBR (p < 0.01). All groups except
   female control demonstrated parallel decreases in cardiac active gain
   and causality, while the FC demonstrated an increase in cardiac
   causality despite a similar decline in cardiac active gain. Results
   showed that the proposed exercises may alleviate muscle-pump baroreflex
   declines but could not influence the cardiac baroreflex decline from 14
   days of inactivity in older adults.},

Title = {Advances in intelligent and autonomous navigation systems for small UAS},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A significant growth in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations has
   been observed over the past decade, largely driven by the emergence of
   new commercial opportunities and use-cases. This has posed new
   techno-logical and regulatory challenges in order to address the complex
   safety, efficiency and sustainability re-quirements associated with UAS
   operations in an increasingly congested airspace. The growing need for
   trusted autonomy in UAS operations imposes demanding performance
   requirements on Navigation and Guidance Sys-tems (NGS), both in terms of
   accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. In most current NGS
   imple-mentations, system autonomy is tightly constrained within a
   specified set of operational and environmental conditions through a
   large number of explicit rules. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial
   Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized
   processor boards with low form-factor has led to the oppor-tunity to
   employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system
   performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the
   majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS
   navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and
   Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for
   localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a
   comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including
   aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion
   algorithms. Addi-tionally, performance monitoring and augmentation
   strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and
   future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is
   on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of
   AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A
   critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS
   navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance
   benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed
   methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN),
   Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key
   challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS
   operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers
   the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a
   key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis
   will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to
   sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its
   likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution.},

Abstract = {The 14th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2015)
   reviewed substantial new evidence on locoregional and systemic therapies
   for early breast cancer. Further experience has supported the adequacy
   of tumor margins defined as `no ink on invasive tumor or DCIS' and the
   safety of omitting axillary dissection in specific cohorts. Radiotherapy
   trials support irradiation of regional nodes in node-positive disease.
   Considering subdivisions within luminal disease, the Panel was more
   concerned with indications for the use of specific therapies, rather
   than surrogate identification of intrinsic subtypes as measured by
   multiparameter molecular tests. For the treatment of HER2-positive
   disease in patients with node-negative cancers up to 1 cm, the Panel
   endorsed a simplified regimen comprising paclitaxel and trastuzumab
   without anthracycline as adjuvant therapy. For premenopausal patients
   with endocrine responsive disease, the Panel endorsed the role of
   ovarian function suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane for
   patients at higher risk. The Panel noted the value of an LHRH agonist
   given during chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER-negative
   disease in protecting against premature ovarian failure and preserving
   fertility. The Panel noted increasing evidence for the prognostic value
   of commonly used multiparameter molecular markers, some of which also
   carried prognostic information for late relapse. The Panel noted that
   the results of such tests, where available, were frequently used to
   assist decisions about the inclusion of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the
   treatment of patients with luminal disease, but noted that threshold
   values had not been established for this purpose for any of these tests.
   Multiparameter molecular assays are expensive and therefore unavailable
   in much of the world. The majority of new breast cancer cases and breast
   cancer deaths now occur in less developed regions of the world. In these
   areas, less expensive pathology tests may provide valuable information.
   The Panel recommendations on treatment are not intended to apply to all
   patients, but rather to establish norms appropriate for the majority.
   Again, economic considerations may require that less expensive and only
   marginally less effective therapies may be necessary in less resourced
   areas. Panel recommendations do not imply unanimous agreement among
   Panel members. Indeed, very few of the 200 questions received 100\%
   agreement from the Panel. In the text below, wording is intended to
   convey the strength of Panel support for each recommendation, while
   details of Panel voting on each question are available in supplementary
   Appendix S2, available at Annals of Oncology online.},

Title = {Changes in crop type distribution in Zhangye City of the Heihe River
   Basin, China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {22-36},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With rapid economic development in China, crops have undergone
   remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and
   accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and
   agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural
   production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in
   planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such
   knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural
   competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee
   national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in
   the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated
   upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on
   multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial
   distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and
   analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition,
   some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern
   of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four
   conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural
   network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in
   Zhangye was high, at 89.38\%. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land
   area in Zhangye increased from 463.81 x 10(3) ha to 493.89 x 10(3) ha.
   The sowing area of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39.21 x 10(3) ha
   and 5.99 x 10(3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the sowing
   area decreased by 3.61 x 10(3) ha and 9.14 x 10(3) ha, respectively.
   Considering other crop types as a group, their sowing area decreased by
   only 2.37 x 10(3) ha. The increase in corn sowing area mainly came from
   the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43.09\% of
   its total sowing area in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed
   a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the
   tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high
   conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while
   wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle
   and Shandan counties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Estimation of the Value of Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration Services under

   Area)},

Abstract = {The Qinling-Daba Mountain area is a transitional zone between north and
   south China and not much is known about its carbon storage, particularly
   its pool of soil organic carbon (SOC). Given this shortcoming, more
   reliable information regarding its SOC is needed. In light of this, we
   quantified above and below-ground carbon sinks using both the
   Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon
   cycle process model. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for
   carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios
   using the NPV model. Our results indicated that the net primary
   productivity (NPP) was lower in places with low density forests that
   were situated at high elevation. The spatial distribution of carbon
   storage depended on NPP production and litter decompositon, which
   reflected specific vegetation as well as temperature and moisture
   gradients. The lowest amounts of carbon storage were in the center of
   the Qinling Mountains and also partly in the Daba area, which is a
   location associated with sparse grassland. Contrastingly, the
   broad-leaved forested area showed the highest amount of carbon storage.
   NPV was positively correlated with discount rate and carbon prices, thus
   resulting in the highest values in the forests and grassland. The net
   present value of total soil carbon sequestration in the six scenarios in
   2015 was 3.555 b yuan, 3.621 b yuan, 5.421 b yuan, 5.579 b yuan, 7.530 b
   yuan, 7.929 b yuan; The net present value of total soil carbon
   sequestration in 6 scenarios in 2017 is 2.816 b yuan, 2.845 b yuan,
   4.361 b yuan, 4.468 b yuan, 6.144 b yuan, 6.338 b yuan (billion = 10(9);
   b; RMB is the legal currency of the China, and its unit is yuan, 1 euro
   = 7.7949 yuan, and 1 pound = 9.2590 yuan). Levying a carbon tax would be
   a notable option for decision makers as they develop carbon emission
   reduction policies. Given this, incorporating discount rates and carbon
   pricing would allow for more realistic value estimations of soil organic
   carbon. This approach would also provide a theoretical basis and
   underscore the practical significance for the government to set a
   reasonable carbon price.},

Abstract = {When world markets are in an unfavorable economic environment as they
   are now at the time of this research report, and national trade balances
   and currency convertibility and transfer hinder or prevent international
   business trade, many countries find it necessary to restrict their
   imports. In order to overcome this, import traders often link an
   agreement involving the purchases of foreign goods and services to
   exports of domestic goods and services. This contractual linkage of
   imports to exports is oftentimes known as the countertrade element of
   `offset' or `reciprocal trade' or `industrial participation'. Industrial
   participation results from a contractual arrangement for a seller of a
   primary item to provide manufacturing and production information and
   support for co-production rights. By assisting a foreign nation market
   these co-produced goods abroad, the seller (industrially developed)
   country can establish powerful trade allies with its government and
   industrial bases and the buyer (developing) country can increase their
   level of export trade.
   Developing into an acceptable and conventional behavior within
   international trade, industrial cooperation/offset is an activity
   resulting in much scrutiny and analysis. The pressures in the
   marketplace drive businesses to agree to industrial cooperation
   activities in order to obtain sales. These activities include:
   - the generation of convertible foreign currency by contractual
   agreements to sell goods and services created by non-convertible local
   currency,
   - the acceptance of credits by a third party to offset the trade
   obligation between a buyer and a seller,
   - the relinquishment of production rights to a buyer in exchange for a
   sale, and,
   - the requirement to generate exports improving the economic base of a
   country in trade for a sale of defense goods and services.
   Turkey's national policy for administering such an industrial
   cooperation benefits program has developed into a government strategy by
   which to have long term relationships with the country's foreign
   suppliers while encouraging/ committing them (and their subcontractors/
   suppliers) through buyer entities to reciprocate by purchasing goods and
   services in Turkey with hard currency and/or making investments later in
   an amount equal to a predetermined percentage of the designated defense
   procurements {[}1].
   This policy has served Turkey well in the past; now with its space
   launch program, the country hopes to gain advances in space technology
   with the subsequent benefits and applications of dual use technologies
   for co-production and contract manufacturing activities at, among
   various locations, the Aegean Free Zone (AFZ) in Izmir, Turkey - the
   selected focus of this report. This has been an attractive initiative
   for the country now engaged in its own space satellite launch program
   for surveillance and communications capabilities {[}2].
   Because the very bases of these space and aerospace activities involve
   highly collaborative team work between global entities in both
   industrially developed and developing countries, there are vast
   opportunities for the merging of ideas and goals attendant to joint
   space research, innovation and the contribution to increase export trade
   levels.
   The researchers have undertaken to examine how such opportunities have
   come about through the industrial cooperation and offset commitment
   framework that has been set up to permit the participation by buyer and
   sellers operating within the country's defense and aerospace procurement
   programs. This research is considered important as space technology is
   the most versatile field in science that gives developing countries
   incentives within their own space-faring aspirations.
   This paper will demonstrate the challenges and opportunities for the
   industrial collaboration through the aerospace and space technological
   offset commitments programs and will suggest that such pursuits by the
   Aegean Free Zone Will significantly contribute to the economical growth
   objectives of the country.},

Title = {Object-based assessment of burn severity in diseased forests using
   high-spatial and high-spectral resolution MASTER airborne imagery},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems are subject to a variety of disturbances with
   increasing intensities and frequencies, which may permanently change the
   trajectories of forest recovery and disrupt the ecosystem services
   provided by trees. Fire and invasive species, especially exotic
   disease-causing pathogens and insects, are examples of disturbances that
   together could pose major threats to forest health. This study examines
   the impacts of fire and exotic disease (sudden oak death) on forests,
   with an emphasis on the assessment of post-fire burn severity in a
   forest where trees have experienced three stages of disease progression
   prefire: early-stage (trees retaining dried foliage and fine twigs),
   middle-stage (trees losing fine crown fuels), and late-stage (trees
   falling down). The research was conducted by applying Geographic
   Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to MASTER airborne images that were
   acquired immediately following the fire for rapid assessment and
   contained both high-spatial (4 m) and high-spectral (50 bands)
   resolutions. Although GEOBIA has gradually become a standard tool for
   analyzing high-spatial resolution imagery, high-spectral resolution data
   (dozens to hundreds of bands) can dramatically reduce computation
   efficiency in the process of segmentation and object-based variable
   extraction, leading to complicated variable selection for succeeding
   modeling. Hence, we also assessed two widely used band reduction
   algorithms, PCA (principal component analysis) and MNF (minimum noise
   fraction), for the delineation of image objects and the subsequent
   performance of burn severity models using either PCA or MNF derived
   variables. To increase computation efficiency, only the top 5 PCA and
   MNF and top 10 PCA and MNF components were evaluated, which accounted
   for 10\% and 20\% of the total number of the original 50 spectral bands,
   respectively. Results show that if no band reduction was applied the
   models developed for the three stages of disease progression had
   relatively similar performance, where both spectral responses and
   texture contributed to burn assessments. However, the application of PCA
   and MNF introduced much greater variation among models across the three
   stages. For the early-stage disease progression, neither band reduction
   algorithms improved or retained the accuracy of burn severity modeling
   (except for the use of 10 MNF components). Compared to the
   no-band-reduction scenario, band reduction led to a greater level of
   overestimation of low-degree burns and underestimation of medium-degree
   burns, suggesting that the spectral variation removed by PCA and MNF was
   vital for distinguishing between the spectral reflectance from
   disease-induced dried crowns (still retaining high structural
   complexity) and fire ash. For the middle-stage, both algorithms improved
   the model R-2 values by 2-37\%, while the late-stage models had
   comparable or better performance to those using the original 50 spectral
   bands. This could be explained by the loss of tree crowns enabling
   better signal penetration, thus leading to reduced spectral variation
   from canopies. Hence, spectral bands containing a high degree of random
   noise were correctly removed by the band reduction algorithms. Compared
   to the middle-stage, the late-stage forest stands were covered by large
   piles of fallen trees and branches, resulting in higher variability of
   MASTER imagery.
   The ability of band reduction to improve the model performance for these
   late-stage forest stands was reduced, because the valuable spectral
   variation representing the actual late-stage forest status was partially
   removed by both algorithms as noise. Our results indicate that PCA and
   MNF are promising for balancing computation efficiency and the
   performance of burn severity models in forest stands subject to the
   middle and late stages of sudden oak death disease progression. Compared
   to PCA, MNF dramatically reduced image spectral variation, generating
   larger image objects with less complexity of object shapes. Whereas,
   PCA-based models delivered superior performance in most evaluated cases
   suggesting that some key spectral variability contributing to the
   accuracy of burn severity models in diseased forests may have been
   removed together with true spectral noise through MNF transformations.

Abstract = {Monthly water balance accounts (1990-2006) were developed for 145 river
   reaches within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) as part of the
   Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields project. They were used to
   assess how well river hydrology is measured and understood, and to
   identify the main uncertainties in river modelling. The purpose of
   accounting was different compared to water accounting systems set up for
   natural resources management, such as those that will be produced by the
   Bureau of Meteorology. Many aspects are still relevant however. A brief
   overview of the methods and data sources is provided, with emphasis on
   the methods used to combine different data sources in water balance
   accounts. Some benefits of the approach taken were identified as well as
   deficiencies requiring improvement.
   The aggregate water balance accounts are presented for all reaches that
   could be assessed, which covered most but not all of the MDB's river
   sections. The components of the water balance for which on-ground
   hydrometric data are available were compared to those which could be
   attributed with less direct observations, and apparent gains and losses
   that could not be attributed, respectively (noting that these will have
   included both real water and estimation errors in all terms).
   Approximately 48\% of the overall water balance appeared to be gauged.
   Another 21\% could be attributed, whilst the remaining 31\% was
   unattributed. Comparison of the accounted and simulated water balance
   was not straightforward but provided useful insights into the
   assumptions made in modelling, and the uncertainty in these assumptions.
   Some implications for `formal' water accounting are discussed. Unlike
   perhaps financial accounting, all numbers in a water account will be
   indirectly derived using estimation methods, because (1) every
   hydrological observation is indirect and involves a varying degree of
   estimation; and (2) not including even more indirect estimation methods
   (e. g. hydrological models) will produce water accounts that are
   incomplete and probably not useful. The suggested alternative is to use
   the full range of observations in a modelling framework that considers
   the uncertainty in the model as well as in all observations, to maximise
   both accuracy and precision in the accounts. Water accounts were most
   uncertain towards the end of inland river systems, particularly where
   anabranching and wetlands occur alongside irrigated areas: through
   unregulated or distributed diversions and extractions, losses to
   floodplains and wetlands, and groundwater recharge. These can all occur
   within the same reach and at the same time. In addition accurate
   streamflow gauging can also be challenging in this environment.
   Satellite observations of land use, evapotranspiration and inundation
   offer the best opportunity for further reducing uncertainty in these
   areas. Uncertainty is least in the unregulated, wetter headwaters of
   most of the regions, where gauging is better and processes better known.
   A degree of model `over fitting' was identified; for example, increasing
   the total water balance volume to accommodate what effectively may well
   be errors in streamflow gauging. Calibration of hydrological models
   against all gauging and other data simultaneously in a way that
   considers the error in observations will help reduce such compensating
   errors, reduce the unattributed component in water accounts, and provide
   consistent uncertainty estimates for each term.},

Title = {Allometric models and aboveground biomass stocks of a West African Sudan
   Savannah watershed in Benin},
Journal = {CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Background: The estimation of forest biomass changes due to land-use
   change is of significant importance for estimates of the global carbon
   budget. The accuracy of biomass density maps depends on the availability
   of reliable allometric models used in combination with data derived from
   satellites images and forest inventory data. To reduce the uncertainty
   in estimates of carbon emissions resulting from deforestation and forest
   degradation, better information on allometric equations and the spatial
   distribution of aboveground biomass stocks in each land use/land cover
   (LULC) class is needed for the different ecological zones. Such
   information has been sparse for the West African Sudan Savannah zone.
   This paper provides new data and results for this important zone. The
   analysis combines satellite images and locally derived allometric models
   based on non-destructive measurements to estimate aboveground biomass
   stocks at the watershed level in the Sudan Savannah zone in Benin.
   Results: We compared three types of empirically fitted allometric models
   of varying model complexity with respect to the number of input
   parameters that are easy to measure at the ground: model type I based
   only on the diameter at breast height (DBH), type II which used DBH and
   tree height and model type III which used DBH, tree height and wood
   density as predictors. While for most LULC classes model III
   outperformed the other models even the simple model I showed a good
   performance. The estimated mean dry biomass density values and attached
   standard error for the different LULC class were 3.28 +/- 0.31 (for
   cropland and fallow), 3.62 +/- 0.36 (for Savanna grassland), 4.86 +/-
   1.03 (for Settlements), 14.05 +/- 0.72 (for Shrub savanna), 45.29 +/-
   2.51 (for Savanna Woodland), 46.06 +/- 14.40 (for Agroforestry), 94.58
   +/- 4.98 (for riparian forest and woodland), 162 +/- 64.88 (for Tectona
   grandis plantations), 179.62 +/- 57.61 (for Azadirachta indica
   plantations), 25.17 +/- 7.46 (for Gmelina arborea plantations), to
   204.92 +/- 57.69 (for Eucalyptus grandis plantations) Mg ha(-1). The
   higher uncertainty of agroforestry system and plantations is due to the
   variance in age which affects biomass stocks.
   Conclusion: The results from this study help to close the existing
   knowledge gap with respect to biomass allometric models at the watershed
   level and the estimation of aboveground biomass stocks in each LULC in
   the Sudan Savannah in West Africa. The use of model type I, which relies
   only on the easy to measure DBH, seems justified since it performed
   almost as good as the more complex model types II and III. The work
   provided useful data on wood density of the main species of the Sudan
   Savannah zone, the related local derived biomass expansion factor and
   the biomass density in each LULC class that would be an indispensable
   information tool for carbon accounting programme related to the
   implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+ (reducing emissions from
   deforestation and forest degradation, and forests conservation,
   sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon
   stocks) initiatives.},

   Large Fishery of the Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
   pandemic and related restrictive measures on the activity of the Italian
   fleet of trawlers, which represents one of the most important fisheries
   in the Mediterranean Sea. We integrated multiple sources of information
   including: (1) Fleet activity data from Vessel Monitoring System, the
   most important satellite-based tracking device; (2) vessel-specific
   landing data disaggregated by species; (3) market and economic drivers
   affecting the effort variation during the lockdown and in the related
   fishing strategies; (4) monthly landings of demersal species in the main
   Italian harbors. These data sources are combined to: (1) Assess the
   absolute and relative changes of trawling effort in the geographical
   sub-areas surrounding the Italian coasts; (2) integrate and compare
   these changes with the market and economic drivers in order to explain
   the observed changes in fishing effort and strategy; (3) analyze the
   changes of the fishing effort on the Landing-per-unit-effort (LPUE) in
   order to further understand the strategy adopted by fishers during this
   crisis and to infer the potential consequence for the different stocks.
   The results provide an overview of the effects of the ``COVID-19
   shock,{''} in terms of fishing activity and socio-economic drivers,
   demonstrating that the consequences of the pandemic have been very
   varied. Although the COVID-19 shock has caused a marked overall
   reduction in activity in the first semester of 2020, in some cases the
   strategies adopted by fishermen and the commercial network linked to
   their activity have significantly reduced the impact of the emergency
   and taken back catch and effort to levels similar to those of previous
   years. These results could provide insights for management measures
   based on temporal stops of fishing activities. In particular, if no
   limits to the fishing effort after the restart of fishing activities are
   adopted, the benefits of fishing pressure reduction on fishery resources
   could be nullified. On the other hands, when fishing activities restart,
   and in the absence of catch control, effort tends to increase on coastal
   bottoms characterized by greater abundance of resources and longer
   effective fishing time.},

Title = {Evaluating rainfall datasets to reconstruct floods in data-sparse
   Himalayan region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Floods are widespread natural disasters having significant
   socio-economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management
   strategies. Flood modelling is an enduring challenge, especially over
   the data-sparse mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, due to the
   lack of accurate rainfall measurements. Global datasets are often
   employed for flood modelling; however, their applicability over the
   Himalayan terrain is still uncertain. In this regard, the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model is
   increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates. This work aims
   at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets,
   satellite product, and the WRF model to represent heavy rainfall over
   the Himalayan terrain. Further, these datasets are used to drive the
   Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to assess their
   ability to reconstruct floods in the Himalayan region. A Rainfall-Flood
   Skill Score (RFSS) is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall
   datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the
   region. The range of RFSS can vary from - infinity to 1, with positive
   values as the desired value. The analysis is conducted over the upstream
   part of the Upper Ganga Basin, spanning from high elevation mountains to
   the foothills of the Himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that
   caused flooding in the region. Quantitative evaluation of rainfall
   datasets in terms of bias, RMSE, and scale errors shows high spatial
   variability with different datasets performing differently over various
   regions of the study area. The topography is observed to influence the
   performance of rainfall datasets. Based on the error metrics, it is
   found that the rainfall simulated using the WRF model exhibits least
   error in high elevation and valley regions of the Himalayas, whereas,
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation
   Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR, in some
   cases) datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the
   Himalayas. On forcing the VIC model with these datasets, the WRF model
   with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest
   RFSS score of 0.97 among all the datasets and, therefore, considered
   most suitable for simulating floods in the study region.},

Title = {Generating digital terrain model: joint use of airborne lidar data and
   optical images},
Journal = {TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The knowledge of an accurate topography is a prerequest for monitoring
   natural hazards and for environmental management (e.g. hydrologic and
   erosion models). Remote sensing lidar systems are active sensors which
   record altimeter data of the Earth's surface as 3D point clouds: from an
   emitted laser pulse, the receptor detects backscaterred photons from the
   reflecting target. The altimeter accuracy is often higher than in the
   case of using stereoscopic conventional techniques, even if the ground
   density of the data is often lower. Additionnaly, beyond the altimeter
   information, these data contain spectral information related to the
   target reflectance in the infra-red domain. Depending on the target
   geometry, lidar systems can acquire several echos for a single laser
   pulse. This property is particularly interesting in forests or in areas
   of urban vegetation since it provides not only the canopy height, but
   also, under certain conditions, the terrain height under the vegetation
   layer.
   Many algorithms have been implemented to sort out the automatic
   classification problem of 3D point clouds providing ground and
   off-ground points as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). This is
   mainly due to the various aspects of landscapes within a global survey
   which can include urban, forest or mountainous areas.
   This paper presents the generation of DTMs based on the joint use of
   optical images and lidar data. The study is focused on rural areas where
   a large scale mapping is a major issue. We propose an algorithm based on
   a predictive Kalman filter for which the temporal component is replaced
   by a spacial indexation. The algorithm consists in analyzing the
   altimeter distribution of the point cloud of a local area in the local
   slope frame. We insist on the role of local slopes for determining the
   ground height especially in case of steep slope terrain. We assume that
   points of the first altimeter mode (lowest points) belong to the
   terrain. The mean height of these points correspond to the measured DTM
   value. The final DTM value at a specific position is obtained by a
   linear combination between the measured value and the predicted value.
   The predicted value depends on the neighboring pixels through their
   respective uncertainties. The slopes are also integrated in the
   predictive filter. The local slope is estimated by robust M-estimator,
   based on the local first altimeter mode. The final slope for each site
   depends on the corresponding neighborhood uncertainties. This process
   makes the slope estmation more robust. Finally, the predictive Kalman
   framework provides not only a robust terrain surface, but also an
   uncertainty for each DTM pixel as well as a map of normal vectors.
   The local window size is a critical parameter in filtering algorithms.
   It should be small enough to keep all ground details but large enough to
   ensure the removal of off-ground objects such as trees or/and buildings.
   Consequently, we S introduce an adaptation of the local neighborhood
   based on the integration of image and lidar data within a predictor of
   high vegetation areas. In this context, we decided to investigate the
   potential of using raw uncalibrated lidar intensity in case of a joint
   indice computation, which is generally derived from image-based infrared
   data. Consequently, lidar intensity and optical images are combined to
   generate a Hybrid Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (HNDVI). The
   lidar provides the infrared band whereas the aerial image provides RGB
   spectral bands.
   A vegetation mask is then calculated with HNDVI and lidar variance
   information. In fact, higher values of HNDVI are likely to correspond to
   vegetated areas and vegetation is described as non-ordered point cloud
   with a high variance compared to human-made structures. Based on the
   vegetation mask, the local neighborhood size continuously varies from a
   predefined minimum distance to an automatically processed upper boundary
   depending on the vegetated area density. Lidar data have been collected
   in 2004 by the Institut Frangais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la
   Mer (IFREMER) over the Morbihan Gulf, France. It has been funded by
   TOTAL. The entire survey is composed of 230.106 points with intensities
   and has been acquired with an ALTM (Optech) system 1210. The point
   density is 0.7 pt/m(2). The lidar wavelength is 1064 nm. Optical images
   are extracted from the BDOrtho (R) French orthophoto data basis of the
   Institut Geographique National with a nominal resolution of 0.5 m, but
   resampled at 2.5 m for the generation of the Hybrid-NDVI image.
   Conclusive results show the potentiality of a full combination of lidar
   data and RGB optical images for improving the generation of fine DTMs on
   rural environments. The filtering process is more robust, DTM are less
   picked due to vegetation filtering. However, in case of dense
   vegetation, the window size can be large and the average terrain height
   may be underestimated. As future work, further area predictors can be
   developed to adapt the proposed methodology to various landscapes and
   relieves.},

Abstract = {Educational Technology (ET) is a systematic way of designing,
   implementing and evaluating the total process of learning and teaching
   in terms of specific objectives based on research on human learning and
   communication and employing a combination of human and non-human
   resources to bring about more effective instruction. Realizing the
   importance of Media and Educational Technology in India, the National
   Policy on Education in its modified document-1992 states that Modern
   communication technologies have the potential to bypass several stages
   and sequences in the process of development encountered in earlier
   decades both the constraints of time and distance at once become
   manageable. In order to avoid structural dualism, modern educational
   technology must reach out to the most distant areas and deprive sections
   of beneficiaries simultaneously with the area of comparative affluence
   and ready availability. Further, it has stated that Educational
   Technology will be employed in the spread of useful information, the
   training and retraining of teachers, to improve quality education,
   sharpen awareness of art and culture, and inculcate abiding values etc.,
   both in the formal and non-formal sectors. Maximum use will be made of
   the available infrastructure. Today, India engages nearly 5.5 million
   teachers spread over around one million schools to educate about 202.5
   million children. A look at the data and analyses on the growth of
   teacher education organizations in the country indicates that the number
   of these institutions have increased from 2051 in 2000 to 4550 in 2005
   and to about 8000 in 2012.
   The orientation of teachers and teacher educators in such a huge system
   at regular intervals is a challenging task. Covering all such teachers
   and teacher educators only through face-to-face training and orientation
   programmes is virtually impossible. In the past, the cascade model
   incorporating multitier training stages for the organization of
   orientation programmes has been used as a strategy for training and
   re-training of a large number of teachers and teacher educators in our
   country. The Special Orientation of Primary School Teachers (SOPT) and
   Programme for Mass Orientation of School Teachers (PMOST) have been
   organized successfully by adopting such strategy. This model involves
   successive stages of training. The person who is trained in the earlier
   stage acts as a resource person for training of participants in the
   subsequent stages. In this mechanism of training there is transmission
   loss of information and possibly emphasis in different stages of
   multi-tier programmes. In view of this limitation of the cascade model,
   it is considered that the orientation and training of teachers/teacher
   educators through distance mode with direct communication with experts
   could be a better option. In the recent times, Media and Educational
   Technology are being employed to revitalize the entire education system
   all over the world. Now, the audio and video broadcasting and
   video-conferencing facilities are available in almost every states and
   Union Territories, UTs of our country as a result of launching of a
   series of satellites by Indian Space Research Organization. In our space
   programme, a satellite is exclusively meant for the educational purposes
   in the country.},

Abstract = {New Eastern and Western Range metric tracking capabilities are to be
   implemented for the Air Force Space Command under the Range
   Standardization and Automation (RSA) Program and associated efforts. A
   technical assessment and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) evaluation of the
   proposed use of GPS based instrumentation compared to conventional radar
   based instrumentation for space lift launch vehicle (LV) trajectory
   position and velocity determination has been completed and documented in
   the GPS Trade Study Report. This was the first step in development of
   the Space Lift Range System (SLRS) metric architecture. This paper
   provides an overview of the GPS Trade Study results.
   The study concludes that GPS provides the most cost effective and
   technically feasible method of acquiring LV trajectory data. GPS
   capabilities provide generally improved accuracy and significant cost
   savings compared to metric radar. These benefits are very substantial
   even when redundant ground and launch vehicle GPS instrumentation are
   specified. Payback in savings from eliminated radars occurs in four
   years or less after transitioning if radar modernization that would
   otherwise be needed is considered. Savings are maximized by
   transitioning as soon as possible, but budget and practical constraints
   may cause the transition period to be on the order of six to seven
   years.
   The study provides top le;el GPS support data flow diagrams and
   identifies Eastern and Western Range radar affected by the transition to
   GPS for trajectory data. Radar used for debris track and space object
   tracking requirements are retained and upgraded to improve reliability
   and operating costs. Accuracy and reliability requirements used for the
   study were those provided in the SLRS Technical Requirements Document
   (TRD).
   Accurate ranging signals from the GPS Satellite Constellation are
   essentially uniform over the globe and highly reliable. The Government
   is fully committed to maintaining GPS as a national asset, therefore
   developing a range architecture that takes full advantage of it ensures
   adequate metric capabilities at the lowest overall cost. Also of
   significant economic advantage is the tremendous technology drive due to
   the large and rapidly expanding GPS user equipment market, energized by
   the many military and civilian applications.
   Ground implementation of a metric architecture to support onboard GPS
   receivers is based on standard telemetry instrumentation and data
   processing which is readily adaptable to support automation and remote
   control. This allows for minimum staffing and fast response.
   The SLRS architecture will incorporate the GPS translator signal
   processing capabilities provided at the Eastern Range to support the
   Navy Trident Program. At this time, additional radar support or GPS
   instrumentation are being considered for tracking the SRBs for the NASA
   Shuttle Program. The Air Force Minuteman ICBM Program is currently
   considering GPS instrumentation for future support.
   Development of the EELV and the X-33 may change the need for the current
   medium and heavy LVs to perform GPS integration and flight
   certification. Light vehicles (i.e. Pegasus) will transition to GPS.
   Recommendations are provided for support of the Ranges' current and
   anticipated programs. A timeline of key milestones and decision points
   is provided which takes into account expected influences by
   demonstration of new technologies and by inclusion of new LV programs.},

Abstract = {In July 2014, BOEM issued the NJ Proposed Sale Notice of nearly 344,000
   acres designated for offshore wind (OSW) energy development. The BOEM
   lease auction is expected to take place during the current year. The OSW
   developer(s) who win the lease(s) will submit their development
   application to the NJ Board of Public Utilities (NJ BPU). These
   applications must include a wind resource assessment and economic
   analysis.
   One major focus in the NJ BPU OSW rules is that applications ``shall
   account for the coincidence between time of generation for the project
   and peak electricity demand.{''} Preliminary data analysis shows two
   mesoscale processes-coastal upwelling and sea breeze-may have a
   significant impact on wind generation during peak electricity demand.
   Tasked by NJ BPU, the Rutgers University Center for Ocean Observing
   Leadership (RUCOOL) is using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
   model to resolve these processes and quantify their impact on the wind
   resource.
   The WRF model set-up used is designed specifically for coastal/offshore
   regions, with three pertinent features for these regions. First,
   innovative satellite sea surface temperature (SST) composites at 2km
   resolution are used to resolve coastal upwelling. These composites
   integrate a) our own declouding algorithm set for the Mid Atlantic Bight
   to remove cloudy pixels from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
   (AVHRR) SST scans, and b) coldest pixel composites of the resulting
   declouded AVHRR SST scans, rather than warmest pixel composites that
   would effectively remove coastal upwelling. Second, microscale grid
   spacing (<1km) is used in WRF to resolve the sea breeze circulation,
   which can vary at meso- to microscales. Finally, validation of the WRF
   simulations is performed against coastal/offshore wind monitoring sites
   with atmospheric heights up to 200m, in order to ensure adequate model
   performance in coastal/offshore conditions.
   Three main results will be presented in this paper:
   (i) Coastal upwelling can produce high wind shear (similar to 8 ms(-1)
   across rotor blade dimensions). These significant shear values could
   potentially pose engineering challenges and should be considered in wind
   resource assessments.
   (ii) Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) methodology can be used to
   identify key boundaries and fronts within the sea breeze circulation.
   While the onshore component of the sea breeze is well observed, very
   little is known about its unobserved offshore component, where OSW
   turbines will be installed.
   (iii) Power generation from a hypothetical 3000 MW OSW scenario off NJ
   was analyzed during three different sea breeze cases (one with strong
   upwelling, one with weak upwelling, and one without upwelling).
   Significant variability in power production occurred within each case
   and across the three sea breeze cases (net capacity factor ranged from 1
   to 95\%).
   WRF OSW potential power production data are being ingested by an
   electricity grid model to evaluate the impact of OSW energy penetration
   into the electrical power grid along with evaluating the economic
   portion of the applications. NJ is leading development of such an
   advanced joint atmospheric-economic modeling capability for determining
   the viability of OSW projects.
   Ongoing work includes development of a coupled atmosphere-ocean model
   (WRF-ROMS, Regional Ocean Modeling System), which will provide improved
   capabilities to diagnose coastal air-sea processes (sea breeze and
   coastal upwelling) for OSW resource assessment (i.e. lowering
   uncertainty by including relevant mesoscale processes in simulations),
   and to more accurately predict these processes for operational
   forecasting during OSW construction and O\&M phases.},

Title = {Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by lymph node dissection for
   localised primary cutaneous melanoma},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Background
   Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer-associated mortality. The
   vast majority of newly diagnosed melanomas are confined to the primary
   cutaneous site. Surgery represents the mainstay of melanoma treatment.
   Treatment strategies include wide excision of the primary tumour and
   sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to assess the status of the regional
   nodal basin(s). SLNB has become an important component of initial
   melanoma management providing accurate disease staging.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects and safety of SLNB followed by completion lymph
   node dissection (CLND) for the treatment of localised primary cutaneous
   melanoma.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases up to February 2015: the Cochrane
   Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of
   Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 1),
   MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS ((Latin American and
   Caribbean Health Science Information database, from 1982). We also
   searched the following from inception: African Index Medicus, IndMED of
   India, Index Medicus for the South-East Asia Region, and six trials
   registers. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded
   studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials
   (RCTs). We searched ISI Web of Science Conference Proceedings from
   inception to February 2015, and we scanned the abstracts of major
   dermatology and oncology conference proceedings up to 2015.
   Selection criteria
   Two review authors independently assessed all RCTs comparing SLNB
   followed by CLND for the treatment of primary localised cutaneous
   melanoma for inclusion. Primary outcome measures were overall survival
   and rate of treatment complications and side effects.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted and analysed data on survival
   and recurrence, assessed risk of bias, and collected adverse effect
   information from included trials.
   Main results
   We identified and included a single eligible trial comparing SLNB with
   observation and published in eight different reports (from 2005 to 2014)
   with 2001 participants. This did not report on our first primary outcome
   of overall survival. The study did report on the rate of treatment
   complications. Our secondary outcomes of disease-specific and
   disease-free survival, local recurrence and distant metastases were
   reported. There were 1347 participants in the intermediate-thickness
   melanoma group and 314 in the thick melanoma group.
   With regard to treatment complications, short-term surgical morbidity
   (30 days) in 1735 participants showed no difference between SLNB and
   observation (risk ratio {[}RR] 1.11; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.9
   to 1.37) for wide excision of the tumour site but favoured observation
   for complications related to the regional nodal basin (RR 14.36; 95\% CI
   6.74 to 30.59).
   The study did not report the actual 10-year melanoma-specific survival
   rate for all included participants. Instead, melanoma-specific survival
   rates for each group of participants: intermediate-thickness melanoma
   (defined as 1.2 to 3.5mm) and thick melanomas (defined as 3.50 mm or
   more) was reported.
   In the intermediate-thickness melanoma group there was no statistically
   significant difference in disease-specific survival between study groups
   at 10 years (81.4 +/- 1.5\% versus 78.3 +/- 2.0\%, hazard ratio {[}HR]
   0.84; 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.09). In the thick melanoma group, again there
   was no statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival
   between study groups at 10 years (58.9.3 +/- 4.1\% versus 64.4 +/-
   4.6\%, HR 1.12; 95\% CI 0.77 to 1.64). Combining these groups there was
   some heterogeneity (I-2 = 34\%) but the total HR was not statistically
   significant (HR 0.92; 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.14). This study failed to show
   any difference for its stated primary outcome.
   The summary estimate for disease-free survival at 10 years favoured SLNB
   over observation in participants with intermediate-thickness and thick
   melanomas (HR 0.75; 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.89).
   With regard to the rate of local and regional recurrence as the site of
   first recurrence, a benefit of SLNB uniformly existed in both groups of
   participants with intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (RR 0.56;
   95\% CI 0.45 to 0.69). This is in contrast with a uniformly unfavourable
   effect of SLNB with regard to the rate of distant metastases as site of
   first recurrence, in both groups of participants with
   intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (HR 1.33; 95\% CI 1.03 to
   1.72).
   Authors' conclusions
   We contacted the trial authors querying the lack of data on overall
   survival which was the primary outcome of their important study. They
   stated ``there are numerous additional analyses that have yet to be
   reported for the trial{''}. We expect that overall survival data will be
   available in a future update of this review.
   Disease-free survival and rate of local and regional recurrence favoured
   SLNB in both groups of participants with intermediate-thickness and
   thick melanomas but short-term surgical morbidity was higher in the SLNB
   group, especially with regard to complications in the nodal basin.
   The evidence for the outcomes of interest in this review is of low
   quality due to the risk of bias and imprecision of the estimated
   effects. Further research may have an important impact on our estimate
   of the effectiveness of SLNB in managing primary localised cutaneous
   melanoma. Currently this evidence is not sufficient to document a
   benefit of SLNB when compared to observation in individuals with primary
   localised cutaneous melanoma.},

Title = {A Method for Ground Filtering of Laser Point Cloud and Extraction of
   Tunnel Wall and Target Sphere},
Journal = {CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Objective The quality of tunnel engineering is crucial factor for
   ensuring traffic operation safety. In this regard, tunnel construction
   analysis, tunnel deformation monitoring, and tunnel disaster prediction
   and early warning can be realized by using three-dimensional laser
   scanner to scan the tunnel regularly or irregularly to generate a point
   cloud model and then analyze the point cloud data. The segmentation of
   tunnel wall and target sphere from scanned tunnel laser point cloud
   scenes is an important part of tunnel 3D reconstruction and is the key
   technology for realizing the automatic monitoring of tunnel scenes.
   However, the tunnel 3D point cloud obtained by laser scanning often
   contains noise points and outliers, a high proportion of which is
   attributable to the ground points, which are connected with the tunnel
   wall, in the tunnel point cloud scenes. Direct processing of the tunnel
   point cloud data affects the extraction and recognition of the target
   sphere and tunnel wall. Considering the challenge of tunnel ground
   filtering and the lack of application platforms directly usable to
   segment the tunnel wall and extract the point cloud of the tunnel target
   ball, a ground filtering algorithm suitable for tunnel scenes and
   extraction method of the tunnel wall and target ball are proposed
   herein. Methods Given that extant point cloud filtering algorithms are
   not suitable for tunnel point cloud scenes, this paper proposes a ground
   filtering algorithm based on a combination of RANSAC plane fitting and
   pass -through filtering based on normal evaluation. A normal estimation
   process is added to the plane based on RANSAC fitting to ensure that the
   fitting optimal plane model is on the tunnel ground level. Then, the
   points below the optimal plane level are filtered out in conjunction
   with the pass -through filtering to obtain the tunnel ground points.
   Considering that it is challenging to extract the tunnel wall and target
   sphere, a segmentation method for laser point cloud on the tunnel wall
   (from coarse to fine) and a target sphere extraction method are proposed
   herein. First, the region of interest is extracted from the tunnel
   feature points, and the noise point clusters of the non -tunnel wall are
   then filtered out based on the DBSCAN method under constraints so as to
   obtain the tunnel wall model and possible distribution area of the
   target ball. The DBSCAN fine segmentation of the possible distribution
   area of the target ball under constraints is performed to obtain the
   target ball point clusters, and the nonlinear least squares (NLS)
   fitting is employed to obtain the ball center coordinates and related
   parameters of the target ball.Results and Discussions This paper also
   presents the verification of the effectiveness of the proposed ground
   filtering algorithm and target ball and tunnel wall extraction method in
   two tunnel scenes. Table 3 indicates that the proposed ground filtering
   method is superior to the conventional CSF filtering, slope filtering,
   and ground filtering methods in terms of the regional growth and
   elevation change for three types of errors, Kappa coefficient values,
   and time efficiency values. Thus, the effectiveness and advantages of
   the proposed filtering algorithm in tunnel scenes are demonstrated.
   Table 3 and Fig. 7 (b) show that the Kappa coefficient value of the
   proposed filtering algorithm is the highest, indicating its high
   robustness.
   As indicated by the results of the fusion comparison experiment, as
   compared to the RANSAC plane fitting, the fusion of normal estimation,
   pass-through filtering, and downsampling has a better effect on the
   ground filtering, and the comprehensive filtering effect is stronger
   than that of the comparison methods. This paper presents a comparison of
   the target sphere cluster (DBRTS) obtained by the DBSCAN condition
   constraint method and the manually intercepted target sphere cluster
   (Manual) by using ball fitting experiments. The final ball center error
   and fitting rate verify the effectiveness of the method of obtaining the
   target sphere and fitting method proposed herein. It is evident from the
   comparison in Table 4 that among the three target balls, the fitting
   effect of the proposed method is not as good as that of the NLS fitting.
   This is because the manually intercepted target ball point cloud retains
   more target points, and the more the details, the better the fitting
   effect. However, the proposed method can be employed to automatically
   obtain the target ball point cloud; this is more applicable and robust
   than the method of manually intercepting the target ball. Moreover, the
   spherical center error of DBRTS on the second and third fitting target
   balls is smaller than that of the NLS fitting method of manually
   intercepting the target ball; this indicates that the spherical center
   coordinates of the target ball fitted by this method are closer to the
   true values. In general, the target sphere point cloud obtained with our
   method and sphere fitting method proposed in this paper have evident
   advantages and are applicable in tunnel point cloud scenes.Conclusions
   Considering the 3D point cloud data of tunnel scenes as the research
   object, this paper first proposes a ground filtering algorithm that
   entails a combination of the RANSAC plane fitting method based on normal
   evaluation and pass-through filtering. This method dynamically adjusts
   the threshold according to the point cloud scene and realizes adaptive
   filtering, which has good applicability and robustness. Second, a target
   sphere and tunnel wall extraction scheme based on DBSCAN constraint
   conditions and NLS sphere fitting is also proposed. The clustering
   segmentation is mainly realized using the density property of point
   cloud. The tunnel wall and target sphere point clusters are extracted by
   filtering the noise point clusters in the tunnel by standardizing the
   constraint conditions, and the relevant parameters and distribution are
   then obtained by fitting the target sphere point clusters based on the
   NLS sphere. The target sphere point cloud obtained by this method is
   compared with the manually intercepted target sphere point cloud. The
   experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this method and also
   highlight the advantages of the NLS sphere fitting, which completed the
   target sphere extraction task in tunnel scenes. Although the proposed
   algorithm achieves good results, a few deficiencies still exist. For
   example, regarding large-scale laser point cloud scenes, adoption of
   DBSCAN clustering segmentation is time-consuming, and some methods to
   improve the efficiency of clustering optimization algorithm can be
   studied in the future.},

Abstract = {The EGNOS Safety of Life (SoL) Service was declared available by the
   European Commission on the 2nd of March 2011, this key milestone for the
   European Satellite Navigation gave way to the first EGNOS based
   procedures publication. The first European LPV procedure was published
   in Pau (France) and became operational on the 17th of March 2012, being
   meant to be the first step in Europe's way towards a full scale LPV
   implementation.
   This paper will provide a complete overview of the European framework,
   recent developments and expected roadmap concerning LPV procedures
   implementation, starting with:
   An introduction of the LPV concept (LPV approach is also called APV SBAS
   approach and is charted as an RNAV GNSS approach) together with a
   description of where the LPV approach fits into the global PBN concept
   (LPV identified as RNP APCH application down to LPV minima) being able
   to support the whole approach from the initial approach to the missed
   approach segments.
   A complementary introduction of where LPV could fit into the European
   PBN Implementing Rule (PBN IR) currently under development, which is
   expected to set the regulatory basis for PBN implementation in Europe.
   An outline of the well-known benefits obtained from the LPV approaches,
   which are the rationale for the 36th and 37th ICAO Assembly Resolutions
   (A36-23 and A37-11), illustrating these with the outcomes of the
   numerous pre-operational European projects.
   Moreover the paper will provide information on the EGNOS SoL Service
   evolution and planned enhancements. The improvements provided by the
   recently deployed EGNOS System Release (ESR) 2.3.1p will be described
   together with the current plans for the SoL Service extension and
   subsequent system releases deployment. This will further clarify where
   and when EGNOS-based operations are and will be enabled in Europe.
   On the basis of the pioneer European States' experiences to complete
   their first LPV publications, this paper will step into the Air
   Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) perspective providing:
   A view of the regulatory framework in place to support LPV deployment;
   and
   A detailed description of the current LPV implementation status in
   Europe and the ambitious national plans for LPV publications in the
   short/mid term, showing Europe's expectations concerning the already
   mentioned ICAO objectives compliance for APV (including both APV SBAS
   and APV Baro-VNAV implementations).
   In addition, the paper will provide an insight into the LPV
   implementation from the airspace user perspective with:
   A description of the airworthiness approval and operational criteria for
   LPVs: focusing on EASA AMC 20-28 which, by the ION meeting date, is most
   likely to be published (it is planned to be published in the second half
   of 2012). In line with it the paper will mention the AML STCs (All
   Models List Supplemental Type Certificate) validated by EASA for several
   receiver models and the efforts done by the Agency in the interaction
   with manufacturers and operators (specially in the field of general and
   business aviation) to ease the process of SBAS enabled receivers
   installation and approval.
   Statistics/estimation of equipped users. The paper will survey all
   available data aiming to assess the SBAS enabled avionics market
   penetration and the number of airspace users equipped or planning to get
   equipped with SBAS certified avionics in Europe.
   The paper will also highlight the obstacles to LPV implementation
   together with all these lessons learned that are driving the European
   efforts to provide:
   Guidance material and support to early adopters to assist the aviation
   community in the LPV implementation process. Mentioning for instance,
   the production of guidance material for the implementation of RNP APCH
   operations (addressing all required steps for RNP APCH procedures
   publication) by EUROCONTROL.
   A coordinated approach, driven by all the existing support cells set up
   in different organizations (EUROCONTROL, Eurocae, ICAO, etc.)
   Incentives to boost the adoption of this new operation in the aviation
   sector. EUROCONTROL TEN-T, EC FP7 Program and SESAR program funded
   projects will be mentioned highlighting their expected benefits and how
   they will contribute to accelerate EGNOS adoption by the European
   aviation community.
   Despite this paper is mainly LPV oriented, it will complement its
   content with a description of other SBAS based operations implementation
   and their implementation status. This will include Helicopter point in
   space (PinS) procedures, which are progressively being introduced
   providing clear benefits for Search and Rescue (SAR), SBAS Off Shore
   Approach Procedures (SOAP) or Helicopter Emergency Medical Services
   (HEMS); but also the use of SBAS for navigation and surface/airborne
   surveillance and its potential to enable advanced procedures in the
   future.
   The paper will finally identify the challenges for the future to enable
   the exploitation of the full potential of EGNOS based operations in
   aviation, with the ambition to follow the USA successful example in the
   implementation of WAAS based APV procedures, looking to future potential
   developments in Europe.
   The implementation of LPVs in visual aerodromes is a clear challenge for
   LPV's benefits full exploitation as well. The minimum runway
   infrastructure required, the minimum level of Air Traffic Services
   needed or the eligibility of a privately owned airfield for LPV
   implementation are key issues to work on to drive the needed discussions
   in the applicable fora to trigger the corresponding requirements' update
   to adapt the existing regulatory framework to the current and future
   global GNSS scenario.},

Title = {Axillary treatment for operable primary breast cancer},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background
   Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary
   breast cancer. It provides staging information to guide adjuvant therapy
   and potentially local control of axillary disease. Several alternative
   approaches to axillary surgery are available, most of which aim to spare
   a proportion of women the morbidity of complete axillary dissection.
   Objectives
   To assess the benefits and harms of alternative approaches to axillary
   surgery (including omitting such surgery altogether) in terms of overall
   survival; local, regional and distant recurrences; and adverse events.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register,
   MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization
   International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov
   on 12 March 2015 without language restrictions. We also contacted study
   authors and checked reference lists.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including women with clinically
   defined operable primary breast cancer conducted to compare axillary
   lymph node dissection (ALND) with no axillary surgery, axillary sampling
   or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); RCTs comparing axillary sampling
   with SLNB or no axillary surgery; RCTs comparing SLNB with no axillary
   surgery; and RCTs comparing ALND with or without radiotherapy (RT)
   versus RT alone.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed each potentially relevant
   trial for inclusion. We independently extracted outcome data, risk of
   bias information and study characteristics from all included trials. We
   pooled data according to trial interventions, and we used hazard ratios
   (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary
   outcomes.
   Main results
   We included 26 RCTs in this review. Studies were at low or unclear risk
   of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a
   source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in
   measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB,
   axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary
   surgery.
   No axillary surgery versus ALND
   Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery
   versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences
   between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR1.06, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies)
   although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional
   recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person-years of
   follow-up; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased
   the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.87
   to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low-quality evidence indicated
   no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND
   (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies).
   Axillary sampling versus ALND
   Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus
   ALND. Low-quality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary
   sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95\%
   CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear
   whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence
   compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95\% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants;
   three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND
   for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406
   participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05,
   95\% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less
   likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.13 to
   0.81; 80 participants; one study).
   SLNB versus ALND
   Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND.
   Moderate-quality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB
   compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants;
   three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Differences in local
   recurrence (HR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study),
   locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611
   participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.42
   to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies
   showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes.
   Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to
   0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low-quality evidence). Three
   studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life:
   Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB
   than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference.
   RT versus ALND
   Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND
   (with or without RT). High-quality evidence indicated that overall
   survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone
   compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.21;
   2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely
   in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR
   0.80, 95\% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person-years of follow-up; four
   studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone
   as for ALND(HR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one
   study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND
   remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one
   study).
   Less surgery versus ALND
   When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery
   was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR
   1.08, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.17; 6478 participants; 18 studies). Whether
   local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared
   with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176
   participant-years of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence
   was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.31
   to 1.78; 26,880 participant-years of follow-up; seven studies). Whether
   risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery
   compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665
   participants; five studies). Lymphoedema was less likely after less
   axillary surgery than with ALND (OR 0.37, 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.46; 3964
   participants; nine studies).
   No studies reported on disease control in the axilla.
   Authors' conclusions
   This review confirms the benefit of SLNB and axillary sampling as
   alternatives to ALND for axillary staging, supporting the view that ALND
   of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer
   acceptable practice in people with breast cancer.},

Title = {Spring Migration Ecology of the Mid-Continent Sandhill Crane Population
   with an Emphasis on Use of the Central Platte River Valley, Nebraska},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {189},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-41},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We conducted a 10-year study (1998-2007) of the Mid-Continent Population
   (MCP) of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) to identify spring-migration
   corridors, locations of major stopovers, and migration chronology by
   crane breeding affiliation (western Alaska-Siberia {[}WA-S], northern
   Canada-Nunavut {[}NC-N], west-central Canada-Alaska {[}WC-A], and
   east-central Canada-Minnesota {[}EC-M]). In the Central Platte River
   Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, we evaluated factors influencing staging
   chronology, food habits, fat storage, and habitat use of sandhill
   cranes. We compared our findings to results from the Platte River
   Ecology Study conducted during 1978-1980. We determined spring migration
   corridors used by the breeding affiliations (designated subpopulations
   for management purposes) by monitoring 169 cranes marked with platform
   transmitter terminals (PTTs). We also marked and monitored 456 cranes in
   the CPRV with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to evaluate length
   and pattern of stay, habitat use, and movements. An estimated 42\% and
   58\% of cranes staging in the CPRV were greater sandhill cranes (G. c.
   tabida) and lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis), and they stayed
   for an average of 20 and 25 days (2000-2007), respectively. Cranes from
   the WA-S, NC-N, WC-A, and EC-M affiliations spent an average of 72, 77,
   52, and 53 days, respectively, in spring migration of which 28, 23, 24,
   and 18 days occurred in the CPRV. The majority of the WA-S subpopulation
   settled in the CPRV apparently because of inadequate habitat to support
   more birds upstream, although WA-S cranes accounted for >90\% of birds
   staging in the North Platte River Valley. Crane staging duration in the
   CPRV was negatively correlated with arrival dates; 92\% of cranes stayed
   >7 days. A program of annual mechanical removal of mature stands of
   woody growth and seedlings that began in the early 1980s primarily in
   the main channel of the Platte River has allowed distribution of crane
   roosts to remain relatively stable over the past 2 decades. Most cranes
   returned to nocturnal roost sites used in previous years. Corn residues
   dominated the diet of sandhill cranes in the CPRV, as in the 1970s,
   despite a marked decline in standing crop of corn residues. Only 14\%
   (10 of 74) of PTT-marked migrant cranes stayed at stopovers for >= 5
   days before arriving in the CPRV, which limited the contribution of
   sites south of the CPRV for fat accumulation needed for migration and
   reproduction. Body masses of cranes (after adjusting for body size {[}an
   index of fat]) at arrival in the CPRV varied widely among years
   (1998-2006), indicating the importance of maintaining productive
   habitats on the wintering grounds to condition cranes for migration and
   reproduction. Average rates of fat gain by adult females while in the
   CPRV remained similar from 1978-1979 to 1998-1999 but declined among
   males. Distances cranes flew to feeding grounds in the CPRV increased as
   the percentage of cropland planted to soybeans increased and as density
   of cranes on nocturnal roosts increased. These results suggest that as
   habitats of limited or no value to cranes increase on the landscape,
   more flight time and higher maintenance costs may reduce fat storage. An
   estimated 40\% of diurnal use occurred north of Interstate 80 (I-80)
   where <= 5\% of lands dedicated to crane conservation are located.
   Seventy-four and 40\% of PTT-marked EC-M and WC-A cranes had spring
   migrations that included staging in eastern South Dakota for an average
   of 11 and 10 days, respectively.
   Cranes of the NC-N, WA-S, and WC-A subpopulations staged an average of
   25, 17, and 12 days in central and western Saskatchewan/eastern Alberta.
   Females in these affiliations increased their fat reserves after leaving
   Nebraska by an estimated 450, 451, and 452 g, respectively, underscoring
   the key role of these staging areas in preparing the 3 subpopulations
   for reproduction. After departing Nebraska, MCP cranes roosted primarily
   in basin wetlands. Most of these wetlands are in private ownership and
   lack adequate protection, emphasizing the need for effective laws and
   policies to ensure their long-term protection. The continued success of
   the current management goal of maintaining the MCP at approximately its
   current size and providing diverse recreational opportunities over a
   wide area of midcontinent and western North America is predicated on the
   ability of MCP cranes to continue to store large fat reserves in the
   CPRV in advance of breeding. For the CPRV to remain a key fat storage
   site, active channel maintenance (e. g., clearing of woody vegetation)
   likely will need to continue, along with establishing minimum stream
   flows. These actions would help ensure nocturnal roosting habitat
   remains sufficiently dispersed to provide cranes with daily intake of
   high-energy food adequate for major fat storage and limit risk of high
   mortality from storms and disease. Published 2014. This article is a

Title = {Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Denoising Algorithm Based on Deep
   Learning},
Journal = {ACTA OPTICA SINICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) is a kind of sensor to capture
   microwaves. Its principle is to establish images through the reflection
   of waveforms, so as to solve the problem that traditional optical remote
   sensing radars are affected by weather, air impurities, and other
   environmental factors when collecting images. The most widely used SAR
   is change detection (CD). CD refers to the dynamic acquisition of image
   information from a certain target, which includes three steps: image
   preprocessing, generation of difference maps, and analysis and
   calculation of difference maps. It is applied to the estimation of
   natural disasters, management and allocation of resources, and
   measurement of land topographic characteristics. However, in the process
   of CD, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images will reduce the
   performance of CD. Therefore, the image denoising method has become a
   basic method of preprocessing in CD. How to restore a clean image from a
   noisy SAR image is an urgent problem to be solved.
   Methods Traditional denoising algorithms of SAR images generally use the
   global denoising idea whose principle is to use the global similar
   information in images to perform processing and judgment. In the case of
   the high resolution of images, these algorithms need a series of
   preprocessing such as smoothing and then complete pixel distinction
   through the neighborhood processing of each image block. The algorithms
   usually occupy huge computing resources and have certain spatial and
   temporal limitations in practical applications. In addition, they cannot
   efficiently complete the denoising task. In terms of deep learning, some
   algorithms perform well, but there is still room for improvement in
   network convergence speed, model redundancy, and accuracy. To solve
   these problems, this paper proposes a denoising algorithm based on a
   multi-scale attention cascade convolutional neural network (MALNet). The
   network mainly uses the idea of multi- scale irregular convolution
   kernel and attention. Compared with a single convolution kernel, a
   multi-scale irregular convolution kernel has an excellent image
   receptive field. In other words, it can collect image information from
   different scales to extract more detailed image features. Subsequently,
   the convolution kernels of different scales are concat layers in the
   network, and an attention mechanism is introduced into a concat feature
   map to divide the attention of the features so that the whole model has
   a positive enhancement ability for the main features of the image. In
   the middle of the network, the dense cascade layer is used to further
   strengthen the features. Finally, the image restoration and
   reconstruction are realized by network subtraction.
   Results and Discussions In this paper, qualitative and quantitative
   experiments are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed MALNet model in denoising. The WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-
   CNN algorithms are compared with our proposed method. The clear state
   and complete signs of the denoised images are visually observed. In
   order to make a fair comparison, we use the default settings of the
   three algorithms provided by the authors in the literatures. Peak
   signal-to- noise ratio ( PSNR), structural similarity index measure
   (SSIM), and image entropy are used as objective evaluation indexes. The
   PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy are calculated as error metrics. Three
   denoising algorithms are compared, and airpoirt, mountain, and coast are
   selected as verification images. The denoising effects of airport images
   (Fig. 7), coast images (Fig. 8), and mountain images (Fig. 9) are
   analyzed. It shows the visual effect comparison of denoising results of
   different algorithms. In Figs. 7-9, 6 figures are successively noise-
   free image, noise image, denoised image obtained by WNNM, denoised image
   obtained by SAR-BM3D, denoised image obtained by SAR-CNN and denoised
   image obtained by MALNet. It is obvious that the WNNM denoised image has
   many defects that are not removed completely, and the texture loss is
   quite serious. SAR-BM3D denoised image retains some details, but the
   aircraft fuselage is very vague, and the tail part has gotten most of
   the edge information erased. Although the aircraft wing in the SAR- CNN
   denoised image is recovered, the whole aircraft at the bottom is still
   far from the reference image, and the recovered small objects are
   blurred. It can be seen from Table 3 that the average PSNR value of the
   proposed MALNet is about 9. 25 dB higher than that of SAR-BM3D, about 0.
   75 dB higher than that of SAR-CNN, and about 14. 45 dB higher than that
   of WNNM. Moreover, in terms of the noise level, MALNet is 0. 01 dB less
   than that SAR-CNN. The PSNR value of the proposed MALNet model at each
   noise level is higher than that of other algorithms. Especially, when
   the noise parameter is 20, the proposed method is 2. 56 dB higher than
   that of the SAR- CNN algorithm. In terms of structural similarity (Table
   4), it can be seen that the SSIM of MALNet is mostly the highest among
   all methods. Only when the noise parameter is 50, it is slightly lower
   than that of SAR- CNN, but the average SSIM is still the highest. The
   average information entropy of the denoised images by the four
   algorithms is 7. 113492 bit/pixel for WNNM, 6. 842258 bit/pixel for SAR-
   BM3D, 7. 499375 bit/ pixel for SAR-CNN, and 6. 6917 bit/pixel for
   MALNet. The proposed algorithm outperforms WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-CNN
   by 0. 42179 bit/ pixel, 0. 15056 bit/pixel, and 0. 80768 bit/pixel,
   respectively. Therefore, in terms of the three objective evaluation
   indexes of PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy, the proposed network in this
   paper has better denoising performance than other comparison methods.
   Conclusions In this paper, a new denoising model MALNet is proposed for
   solving the noise in SAR images. This model uses an end-to-end
   architecture and does not require separate subnets or manual
   intervention. The solution includes three modules, i. e., multi-scale
   irregular convolution module, feature extraction module based on
   attention mechanism, and feature enhancement module based on dense
   cascade network. The model also adds batch normalization and global
   average pooling to improve its adaptability. It can complete convergence
   without massive data sets. The image data can complete convergence after
   150 rounds of training. The training efficiency is outstanding, and the
   portability is positive. The experimental results show that compared
   with those of other traditional image denoising algorithms, the PSNR and
   SSIM of the proposed algorithm are improved by 0. 75 dB-14. 45 dB and 0.
   01-0. 16, respectively. The proposed algorithm is superior to other
   algorithms in image entropy and can better recover the details of
   images.},

Abstract = {The Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS) is a comprehensive
   prototype integrated coastal ocean observing system that was established
   in the summer or 2001. its current configuration includes eleven
   solar-powered buoy-monitored locations with physical and optical
   sensors, four shore-based long-range HF radar systems for surface
   current measurement, operational circulation and wave models, satellite
   observations, inshore nutrient monitoring, and hourly web-delivery of
   data. It serves a broad array of real-time oceanographic and marine
   meteorological data and data products to scientists, state and federal
   regulators, the National Weather Service, both the US and Canadian Coast
   Guards, the National Data Buoy Center, educators, regional
   natural-resource managers, the Gulf of Maine fishing and maritime
   industries, local airports and airlines, sailors, and the general
   public. The ocean observing system that can be thought of as consisting
   of four major subsystems: the data acquisition subsystem; the data
   handling, processing, and archiving subsystem; the system of numerical
   nowcast and forecast models; and a web-based data
   distribution/presentation subsystem.
   The Gulf of Maine is a harsh operational environment. Winter storms pose
   severe challenges including the build up of sea ice on buoy, its solar
   panels, and its meteorological sensors. In summer the productive waters
   of the gulf can present severe biofouling problems that affect the
   operation of optical sensors. Thus, the periods of most difficult field
   operations coincide with the periods of greatest data value in terms of
   marine safety, search and rescue, and the monitoring biological
   productivity. Never-the-less, the data returns for the GoMOOS ocean
   sensor array has averaged approximately 90\% over the first seven years
   of operation. This unusually high rate of data return is due in large
   part to our operational six-month duty/maintenance cycle on all
   equipment. We have 22 buoys for I I locations, and 22 complete sets of
   instrumentation that are rotated in and out of service on a six month
   schedule.
   The challenges of the Gulf of Maine physical environment were largely
   understood a priori, and were incorporated into the system design
   criteria and the blueprints for the service and maintenance protocols.
   However, there were unanticipated challenges in the funding process that
   have caused the greatest difficulties, and which continue to pose a
   serious threat to continued operation and success of this ocean
   observing system, as well as others observing systems in the United
   States. Funding for the system has been chronically short and subject to
   the unpredictable fluctuations of a US congressional appropriations
   process. The inadequacy and variability of funding has substantially
   hampered the operations of many of the Integrated Ocean Observing
   Systems (IOOS), including CoMOOS, and has hindered technological
   improvements. The funding crisis has deepened to the point that, unless
   this trend is quickly reversed, the number of monitoring stations will
   be substantially reduced and system will no longer be able to serve many
   of citizens, organizations, and agencies that have come to rely upon the
   data it currently provides.
   Ocean sensors, ocean platform technologies, and modeling and
   visualization techniques are in a period of rapid technical development.
   If stable funding can be achieved, the capabilities of operational ocean
   observing systems could increase dramatically over the next decade.
   Autonomous vehicles could become the fast response survey fleet of the
   IOOS, as well as taking on routine, sustained marine survey functions
   that are already prohibitively expensive to perform using ships, and
   will become even more costly as energy costs rise in the future.
   Practical autonomous vehicles will likely expand beyond gliders and AUVs
   to include surface sail vessels and energy-efficient autonomous aerial
   drones. The combination of time series measurements from profiling
   packages on buoy arrays with the repeatedly spatial surveys of the
   autonomous fleets will provide a new look at our coastal oceans that
   could transform coastal ocean science and management. Coupled with these
   new platform advances will be significant growth in the areas of
   real-time biochemical sensors, sensor miniaturization, high-speed data
   telemetry technologies, increases in onboard data processing
   capabilities, routine two-way communications with submerged sensors, and
   advances in data visualization techniques that will amount to virtual
   presence. The single greatest enabling factor of these broad
   improvements to ocean observing operations and science appears, at
   present, to be the establishment of an adequate, stable, and predictable
   funding process.},
