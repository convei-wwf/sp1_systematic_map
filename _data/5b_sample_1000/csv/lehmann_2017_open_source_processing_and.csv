2,"drones support invasive plant management based industries, such as agriculture and forestry, are negatively small model aircrafts, also called fixed-wing uas, as an affected by non-native tree and shrub invasions (pimentel, 2002; alternative to widely used multirotor drones, have proved bellard et al., 2016)."
2,"consequently, rapid and cost-efficient successful as an environmental remote sensing platform management solutions are in high demand by land managers (laliberte et al., 2011; anderson and gaston, 2013; colomina and across the world."
2,"successful control or eradication depend on molina, 2014; müllerová et al., 2017)."
2,"due to the uplift generated the availability of precise distribution data (e.g., field maps) of by airflow over the wings and more efficient aerodynamics, invasive plants in management areas."
2,"the earlier the populations these platforms provide the advantage of longer flight times of an invasive plant are detected at initial stages of invasion, the at higher speeds and greater payloads and, thus, can cover higher the cost-efficiency and probability of success (rejmánek, larger survey areas per flight compared to multirotor uas."

2,"however, fine-scale field maps requiring regular updates moreover, the simple structure and control electronics are generate high personnel, data, and software costs that often less susceptible to daily usage, reducing maintenance efforts hinder invasive species management efforts (spring et al., 2017). and repair costs."
2,"several companies (e.g., sensefly, questuav, several studies addressing the management of invasive plant gatewing, trimble) offer ready-to-fly fixed-wing uas (including species demonstrate the great potential of remote sensing full autopilot control and camera sensors) which fulfill the criteria techniques for detecting, mapping and predicting the spatial for practical applications in environmental management. spread of plant invaders, in particular when using multispectral however, the number of known practical applications of uas or hyperspectral sensors (huang and asner, 2009; he et al., 2011; by land managers is still relatively low."

2,"additionally, necessary expert knowledge in (bradley and mustard, 2006; vilà and ibáñez, 2011)."
2,"however, image processing and analysis is often lacking, and commercial the precise mapping of invasive trees and shrubs, especially geographic information systems (gis) and remote sensing of small individuals such as seedling and saplings, is still a software are expensive."
2,"as a consequence, interpretation of aerial challenge."
2,"for example, the spatial resolution of satellite-based photography within the field of invasive species management is imagery is often not high enough to facilitate detection of still often limited to time-consuming visual image interpretation. isolated individuals or even small populations."
2,"in contrast, the these circumstances might discourage responsible managers spatial resolution of aerial images collected by conventional from using present uas-based remote sensing methods in their aircrafts may well be sufficient, but customized aerial image daily work routines. flights are expensive and, therefore, not economically viable for the idea behind the work described in this paper is to most invasive species management practitioners, especially when encourage land managers to use uas to map and monitor high repetition rates are required. invasive plant species for eradication and control purposes."
2,"a unmanned aerial systems (uas), popularly known as drones, straightforward, low-cost uas-based approach (total hardware introduce a new remote sensing technique that may become an costs less than 2,000 us dollars) that provides field maps for applicable and affordable alternative to conventional approaches, invasive species management based on easy to handle, affordable as they reduce costs and increase the spatial resolution of equipment and open-source software is presented."
2,"although aerial images (wan et al., 2014; dvořák et al., 2015; chabot this approach does not take varying costs into account (such et al., 2016; hill et al., 2016; müllerová et al., 2016, 2017). as man/hour, perhaps depending on wage-level and skills), it the technical development, component miniaturization, and can be applied by personnel with only basic prior knowledge increased sales in recent years resulted in the rapid growth of of image processing and gis."
2,"besides data acquisition itself, we uas as an environmental remote-sensing platform."
2,"by contrast, present the steps of data processing and image analysis using conventional acquisition of aerial images by airplanes is usually free, open-source image analysis and gis software, and provide more elaborate and expensive, requires more operating personnel a concise workflow scheme."
2,"moreover, we highlight the vast and detailed long-term scheduling."
2,"consequently, its use is potential of uas-acquired remote sensing products to support mostly restricted to surveys that need to cover large areas (50– environmental monitoring and mapping of invasive species. 100 km2 ) with low temporal repetition rates."
2,"however, for an example of acacia mangium (willd.) invasion in a environmental monitoring issues, especially focusing on small savanna-type ecosystem, called mussununga, in the brazilian or mid-sized areas with a certain need for higher coverage atlantic forest domain is used to illustrate our approach. rates, uas technologies are far more economical, flexible, and a. mangium is one of the most aggressive invasive plant species faster, while requiring only one or two persons to conduct the in open ecosystems in southeastern and northern brazil, with survey, which involves image acquisition in the field following substantial negative effects on conservation, agriculture, forestry, set up of the particular mission according to specific needs and land reclamation (aguiar et al., 2014; the horus institute (anderson and gaston, 2013; colomina and molina, 2014)."
