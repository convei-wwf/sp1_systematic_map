1,"recently, satellite imagery has become available accepted 3 september 2011 via the rapideye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in ﬁve broad bands, including the available online 19 october 2011 red-edge region (690–730 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum."
1,"we tested the hypothesis that broadband, keywords: red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll chlorophyll a/b ratio a + b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, forest health blue, and near infrared band reﬂectance spectra."
1,we analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 rapideye piñon-juniper woodland scenes of a piñon-juniper woodland in central new mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by pinus edulis girdling.
1,we found that the normalized difference red-edge index (ndre) allowed stress to be detected juniperus monosperma 13 days after girdling — between and 16 days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the normalized stress detection difference vegetation index (ndvi) and green ndvi traditionally used for satellite based forest health mon- itoring.
1,we conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress mon- itoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems.

5,"chronic decreases in foliar water content decreases plant tran- non-girdled trees, which might have affected the results."
5,"therefore, a spiration and carbon gain, which can lead to higher susceptibility to repeat analysis was conducted after selecting a second independent other plant stresses and result in mortality (breshears et al., 2009). set of treatment and control pixels, which yielded comparable results."
5,"water stressed plants can also be more susceptible to insects and dis- eases (breshears et al., 2009)."
5,"this suggests that a satellite based early warning system in water-limited ecosystems should ideally rely on both — remote sensing matrices that are sensitive to variations in plant water status and chlab (e.g., ndre as has been shown in this study)."
5,"based on our results, the application of a satellite platform that pro- vides red-edge band information appears promising for the develop- ment of a wildland early warning system for land management organizations."
