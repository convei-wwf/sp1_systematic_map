1,this research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning.
1,"while conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present."

2,the application of fertilizers in precision agriculture is an investment to increase the production potential of each plant within the agricultural parcel.
2,"this fact does not justify using a larger amount of fertilizer to achieve high yields, instead of achieving stable crop yields in an economical and efficient manner [6]."
2,fertilization in precision agriculture mainly ensures long-term optimal distribution of nutrients according to crop needs [7].
2,"with technology development, conventional fertilization based on the average values of fertilizer applications within the agricultural land as a homogeneous unit is becoming obsolete."
2,"instead, precision agriculture considers the agricultural parcel as a heterogeneous system, which is often very variable in its local spatial units [8]."
2,"such an approach aims to balance the nutrients in the soil on the entire agricultural plot, so that all its parts enable optimal crop development [4]."
2,"fertilization of agricultural crops is regularly performed in several iterations, following the current crop growth stage and the implementation of agrotechnical operations [9]."
2,"basic fertilization involves the application of mineral and organic fertilizers before sowing, providing a sufficient amount of available nutrients in the soil to develop the plant root system."
2,"supplementary fertilization allows for correcting the previously applied rates in basic fertilization, depending on the crop growth stage."
2,spatial continuous data are crucial for making reliable prescription maps in precision fertilization.
2,"this property primarily refers to basic fertilization, where site-specific pre- scription zones form the basis of practical application based on discrete soil sampling [10]."
2,"supplementary fertilization relies more heavily on indirect nutrient assessment in crops based on remote sensing, with soil sampling being used as a secondary spatial data source."
2,most of the collected data based on soil sampling are in a point vector format.
2,"to determine the continuous areas, it is necessary to estimate the values in non-sampled areas using spatial prediction methods [11]."
2,a conventional postulate is that interpolation is one of the key components of data processing and analysis in the geographic information system (gis) environment and is the subject of the study of statistics and geostatistics [12].
2,"interpo- lation is known as the process of deterministic or geostatistical prediction of the values of non-sampled areas, based on georeferenced soil samples to calculate a continuous surface."
2,"papadopoulus et al. [13] stated that the key component in site-specific crop cultivation is geoinformation technologies, while agricultural land management depends on ecological and natural resources that have a spatial component."
2,"geoinformation technologies are becoming a key factor in precision fertilization, as a basis for integrating discrete spatial data of soil sampling and their spatial prediction [4]."
2,"in addition to the direct application of spatial interpolation methods in precision fertilization, there is a successful long-term application in related soil-related activities."
2,remote sensing data and methods were successfully implemented in various ap- plications within precision agriculture [14–17].
2,"many authors have also used open and commercial satellite data for real-time monitoring of agricultural crops [16,18,19]."
2,"earth observation satellites (e.g., planetscope) enable the daily monitoring of agricultural crops’ condition in large areas without going out into the field [20,21] and many authors give huge importance to developing fully automatic remote sensing methods that lead to com- plete automation of the satellite image-processing process [22,23]."
2,"in this way, end-users without advanced remote sensing knowledge can obtain a final product such as a weed map or soil moisture map automatically, almost in real-time."
2,"remote sensing techniques based on machine learning algorithms can be used to predict and assess the physical and chemical parameters of the soil, which is extremely important for the fertilization process in precision agriculture [23–25], but although remote sensing data and methods are widely used in agriculture today, it is necessary to emphasize and exactly specify the importance of remote sensing applicability in the fertilization process."

7,the importance of selecting the optimal interpolation method and its parameters for fertilization in precision agriculture is manifested by avoiding poor agricultural practices and reducing the consumption of mineral and/or organic fertilizers.
7,this directly impacts the financial savings in production and increases profits by achieving stable yields according to the local needs of crops.
7,"for these reasons, many previous studies have noted the importance of optimization of complete process prescription map creation in precision fertilization, which requires a multidisciplinary approach to obtain the desired result [45,46]."
7,"the selection of an optimal spatial interpolation method, and consequentially the prediction accuracy of soil parameters, depends on the properties of the input data set [47]."
7,"therefore, there is no universally optimal spatial interpolation method, and multiple alternatives should be evaluated for each soil sample set [48]."
8,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 778 8 of 22 the assessment of the accuracy of spatial interpolation methods is a necessary step for determining the optimal interpolation methods and parameters for the creation of a prescription map in precision fertilization [49]."
8,some of the most commonly used methods of the accuracy assessment of spatial interpolation results are the cross-validation and the split-sample methods.
8,the cross-validation method is the most commonly used method of assessing the accuracy of interpolation methods and uses all sampled points to develop and compare models [50].
8,"this method is also a suitable choice with a limited number of input values of soil samples, which is a very common case in agricultural land management conditions with smaller and fragmented agricultural parcels."
8,"the leave-one-out technique is the most common form of cross-evaluation, excluding each individual soil sample from the prediction and iteratively repeating the procedure for the number of input soil samples [51]."
8,the reliability of this procedure particularly occurs for the high number of heterogenous soil sampling values.
8,"the split-sample method evaluates the prediction accuracy and robustness of the interpolation methods by splitting the input data into two parts based on a predefined ratio, forming training and test data [29]."
8,the iteration of the procedure and repetitive accuracy assessment ensures the evaluation of consistency and robustness of the selected interpolation method.
8,"among the variety of statistical indicators of the interpolation accuracy, the coefficient of determination (r2 ) and the root-mean-square error (rmse) are two of the most commonly used values [37], also enabling complementary accuracy assessment [52]."
8,"for the purpose of the accuracy assessment of predicted soil properties used in fertilization in precision agriculture, these are calculated according to equations (2) and (3) [47]: 2 ∑n1 (yi − ŷi ) r2 = 1 − 2 (2) ∑n1 (yi − yi ) s 2 ∑n1 (yi − ŷi ) rmse = (3) n ^ ¯ in which yi are the input sample values, yi are the interpolated values, y i is the average sample value, while n is the number of input samples."
8,"besides their extensive application in conventional interpolation methods, these parameters are highly popular in evaluating the performance of the modern machine learning methods in soil mapping as well [53]."
8,geostatistical spatial interpolation methods the main feature of geostatistical methods is using variograms as a technique for quantifying and modelling continuous soil sampling values [54].
8,"unlike the classical deterministic approach, geostatistics considers the spatial dependence of variables, also known as spatial autocorrelation."
8,"geostatistical interpolation methods assume that, by knowing the soil parameters at the sampled locations, it is possible to establish the relation- ship between these values and the distance from the unknown locations [55]."
8,"although geostatistical methods in previous research have generally enabled a higher interpolation accuracy than deterministic methods, they require normal distribution and stationarity of soil sampling data [56]."
8,"in the absence of normal distribution of input data, the application of logarithmic transformation is recommended, which allows the implementation of kriging for such data sets [57]."
8,"while geostatistics is a straightforward concept, it includes several variations of kriging, which encompass the trends in soil sample data."
8,"besides the spatial autocorrelation, particular multivariate kriging methods utilize independent predictors, unlike univariate methods."
8,"according to the number of scientific papers indexed in the web of science core collection database between 2010 and 2020, the most commonly used kriging methods are ordinary, regression, indicator, simple and universal kriging (figure 5)."

10,"the power parameter and the neighborhood size are chosen arbitrarily, and the most common choice is the power parameter of 2 [61]."
10,"the higher p values decrease local heterogeneity and result in smoother areas, often resulting in lower interpolation accuracy when p is above 3."
10,the spline method belongs to the deterministic interpolation methods defined by polynomial curves [62].
10,"polynomials are used to describe parts of a line or surface, based on a small number of points, which results in the smooth surface by their mutual join."
10,"when choosing the p, the curve takes a linear, square or cubic shape, depending on whether the value of p is 1, 2 or 3, respectively."
10,the third-degree cubic curves are most commonly used [63].
10,the linear spline interpolation method is often used to fill data gaps in tables and is much simpler than the cubic method.
10,"additionally, if there are two spatial dimensions, it is considered a bi-linear method, and in the case of the third dimension, three-linear."
10,"spline results in higher interpolation accuracy on surfaces with a less pronounced local variability, so they are not suitable for use in highly heterogenous or extreme cases, especially for smaller areas [64]."

14,comparative displays of interpolation results produced by conventional interpo- lation methods for p2 o5 and k2 o on the representative soil sample set are shown in figures 9 and 10.
14,"the interpolation results for both soil properties indicated a strong de- pendence of the prediction accuracy on the input parameters, indicating the importance of evaluating multiple methods, as well as their parameters, as noted in [47]."
14,"the r2 of the ok ranged from 0.331 to 0.414 for the p2 o5 and from 0.082 to 0.120 for the k2 o, indicating a proportionally lower accuracy for the input values with lower spatial autocorrelation, which is one of the main constraints of its prediction accuracy [97]."

17,"digitization of the entire procedure, from the collection of field data to the computer processing and production of a fertilization prescription map, is the basis of fertilization in precision agriculture."
17,management information systems are becoming
18,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 778 18 of 22 critical in precision fertilization, and for such reasons, their importance inevitably becomes a priority."
18,technological progress leads to the development of more sophisticated and more accessible software packages that particularly segment the processing and appli- cation of spatial data.
18,"modern fertilization relies on the use of agricultural information technology at an increasing level, which is a rapid development in agricultural practice, which now requires the constant learning and training of users and investment in new technological systems."
18,interpolation methods used for the purpose of precision fertiliza- tion play a very important role in the decision-making process and use of sampled data.
18,"each of the methods described in this paper includes a certain level of uncertainty, but knowledge of their capabilities and utility enables the user to select an optimal method and its parameters to ensure maximum prediction accuracy."
18,"the further implementation of spatial interpolation methods in agricultural practice is expected to accelerate the transition from conventional intensive agriculture to precision agriculture, enabling stable yields and sustainable agricultural production in the future."
18,"modern remote sensing data improve the fertilization process in precision agriculture, as an abundant and freely accessible global data source."
18,"radar and optical satellite imagery has allowed significant advances in cropland monitoring (e.g., soil moisture, phosphorous pentoxide) on a daily basis, while on the other side, uavs equipped with novel hyperspec- tral and multispectral cameras enable the monitoring of crops at a centimeter-level."
18,new radar imagery and satellite or uav-based thermal imagery enables the development of novel algorithms and methods for obtaining crop and soil status.
18,"the novel, hybrid meth- ods for modelling crop and soil quality improve the standard conventional and modern machine learning approaches."
18,they also enable the computationally efficient and accurate integration of remote sensing data and achievements in precision agriculture and would also significantly improve the fertilization process.
18,novel hybrid approaches would enable a better spatial resolution and more accurate crop and soil conditions assessment.
18,"the application of earth observation satellites (e.g., planetscope) enables daily soil and crop status monitoring without going out into the field and novel, robust and automatic remote sensing methods will lead to the complete automation of the satellite image-processing process."
18,"this will enable end-users, without any remote sensing knowledge, to obtain a final product such as a weed map or soil moisture map automatically, almost in real-time."
18,"accordingly, it can be concluded that remote sensing data and methods now have a crucial role in the fertilization process in precision agriculture, and their importance is expected to increase in the future."
