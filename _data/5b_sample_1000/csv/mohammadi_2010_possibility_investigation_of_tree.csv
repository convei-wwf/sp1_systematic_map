1,remote sensing received 28 february 2009 imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial received in revised form 10 january 2010 and temporal scales.
1,"in this paper, we explored the possibility of deﬁning relationships between species accepted 7 february 2010 diversity indices and landsat etm+ reﬂectance values for hyrcanian forests in golestan province of iran."
1,we used the cost model for atmospheric correction of the imagery.
1,linear regression models were implemented keywords: to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of simpson indices) using various tree diversity mapping etm+ combinations of landsat spectral data.
1,"species richness was modeled using the band set etm5, etm7, dvi, modeling wetness and variances of etm1, etm2 and etm5 (adjusted r2 = 0.59, rmse = 1.51)."
1,"reciprocal of simpson hyrcanian forests index was modeled using the band set ndvi, brightness, greenness, variances of etm2, etm5 and etm7 (adjusted r2 = 0.459 rmse = 1.15)."
1,the results demonstrated that spectral reﬂectance from landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity.
1,predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest.
1,the methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern iran.
