2,"given the growing global awareness of the ecological environment, the evaluation and protection of the ecological environment have become crucial tasks in china’s modernization endeavors."
2,"since the reform and opening up, china has witnessed unprecedented development across all fields [8]."
2,"however, simultaneously, the ecological environment in china has suffered more severe damage compared to other countries worldwide [9]."
2,"the rapid economic development has come at the expense of ecological degradation, highlighting a disconnect between urbanization development and ecological protection in china, thereby hindering the achievement of sustainable development goals [10,11]."
2,"this low-coupling phenomenon is a growing concern for both the state and society, particularly as the extent of ecological damage increasingly affects people’s lives."

2,"when it comes to assessing eeq, the oecd (organization for economic cooperation and development) introduced the “pressure-state-response” (psr) model in 1990, which was the world’s first recognized eeq assessment index system [13]."
2,"as scientific progress continues, cross-disciplinary applications are becoming increasingly common."
2,"for instance, mohamed et al. [14] utilized gis and rs to examine the interplay between ecological factors, eeq, and urbanization in the nile delta, revealing that rapid urbanization poses significant threats to both ecology and eeq."

2,"however, there is a notable lack of an internationally accepted standard with high precision for eeq evaluation [24]."
2,"in conclusion, there is a scarcity of studies on eeq evaluation in china, and most of the existing studies are limited to specific regions and time periods."
2,"furthermore, there is a dearth of research on continuous, long-term monitoring of eeq in china since the twenty-first century, which is necessary to comprehensively analyze spatial and temporal changes at a nationwide scale from both horizontal and vertical perspectives."

6,"calculation of eeq different indicators possess distinct dimensions, and thus, it is necessary to convert each indicator into a dimensionless form prior to evaluating the eeq."
6,"in this study, the extreme difference standardization method was employed to transform the eight indicators."
6,these indicators were categorized into positive and negative based on their respective impacts on the eeq.
6,"positive indicators encompassed pre (precipitation), npp (net pri- mary productivity), ndvi (normalized difference vegetation index), dem (digital elevation model), and lucc (land use and land cover change), all of which contribute to the en- hancement of the ecological environment."
6,"conversely, negative indicators, including temp (temperature), pop (population), and pet (potential evapotranspiration), denote factors that are ecologically detrimental."
6,the standardized formulas employed are as follows.
6,"positive indicators: rs+ = ( ij − imin )/( imax − imin ) (1) negative indicators: rs− = ( imax − ij )/( imax − imin ) (2) where, rs+ is the standardized value of the jth indicator; ij is the initial value of the jth indicator; imin , imax are the minimum and maximum values of the jth index."
6,"the indicator weighting model serves as a crucial aspect of the evaluation system, as the chosen model’s merits and limitations can significantly influence the evaluation outcomes."
6,"currently, subjective and objective methods are commonly employed for de- termining the weights."
6,the subjective approach encompasses methods such as the gray relation method (grm) [38] and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) [39].
6,"on the other hand, objective methods include the entropy method (em) [40] and the principal component analysis (pca) [41]."
6,"the subjective method exhibits notable limitations in its application and lacks robust theoretical support, whereas the objective method calculates weights based on the interrelationships among indicators."

19,"discussion in contrast to prior investigations, this study conducted long-term eeq (ecological and environmental quality) monitoring in the chinese region using remote sensing data."
19,this approach effectively addresses the limitations inherent in assessments based solely on statistical data [57].
19,"for instance, chen et al. [58] and lv et al. [59] employed panel data to evaluate the ecological and environmental quality of china."
19,"however, the subjectivity of the statistics and the utilization of data from multiple sources led to controversial findings."
19,"by adopting this approach, the inherent constraints associated with assessments relying solely on statistical data are effectively addressed."
19,"furthermore, by utilizing scenario data generated through earth system models and employing the grid-scale approach proposed in this study, it becomes feasible to forecast future ecosystem quality in china and investigate its evolving attributes."
19,we integrated the shared socioeconomic pathway (ssp) [60] and representative concentration pathway (rcp) [61] frameworks to establish three widely employed scenarios.
19,these scenarios were employed to examine the spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem environmental quality (eeq) in china throughout the 21st century.
19,the analysis was based on comprehensive remote sensing data from multiple sources and data from the coupled model intercomparison project 6 (cmip6) model [62].
19,"figure 15 illustrates the consistent spatial pattern between the simulated future eeq for china and historical eeq, indicating the robust generalizability of the eeq simulations conducted in this study."
19,"in figure 15e,f, it can be observed that the average future eeq for china exhibits a slight upward trend across the three scenarios, but the change is not pronounced."
19,"it is noteworthy that under the ssp5-rcp85 scenario, china’s eeq demonstrates a stable increasing trend (figure 15f), implying that the country’s eeq would remain relatively unaffected by traditional fossil fuel-based pathways."
19,this finding suggests that future human activities would have minimal impact on national eeq.
19,"however, it is important to note certain considerations within this study."
19,"for instance, due to limited ground validation data, it is not possible to provide an accuracy assessment for the entire study area."
19,"furthermore, discrepancies among multiple sources of spatial data introduce some level of uncertainty into the eeq assessment results, an aspect that was not extensively explored in this study."
19,"nevertheless, this study offers a fresh perspective on global grid-based eeq monitoring."
19,"moving forward, our research endeavors will focus on investigating eeq dynamics in rapidly urbanizing countries or regions worldwide, with particular attention to nations such as india and the usa."

20,"for in conclusion, this research paper aimed to address the lack of comprehensive studies instance, due to limited ground validation data, it is not possible to provide an accuracy on the evaluation of eco-environmental quality (eeq) in china, particularly in terms of assessment for the entire study area."
20,"furthermore, discrepancies among multiple sources monitoring its spatial and temporal changes at a national scale."
20,"the study highlighted the of spatial data introduce some level of uncertainty into the eeq assessment results, an limitations of existing evaluation methods based on statistical data and proposed a novel aspect that was not extensively explored in this study."
20,"nevertheless, this study oﬀers a approach using remote sensing data to construct an eeq evaluation system, called the fresh perspective on global grid-based eeq monitoring."
20,"moving forward, our research modified remote sensing eco-environmental quality index (m-rseqi)."
20,"the main findings endeavors will focus on investigating eeq dynamics in rapidly urbanizing countries or of this research provide valuable insights into the eeq trends in china from 2000 to 2017. regions worldwide, with particular attention to nations such as india and the usa."

21,"sci. 2023, 13, 8051 21 of 23 and temporal changes in the yellow river basin, yangtze river basin, and four major cities (beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and nanjing)."
21,"the findings revealed variations in the eeq trends among these regions, with improvements observed in the yangtze and yellow river basins."
21,"additionally, the study highlighted the influence of industrial structure and urbanization on the eeq of beijing, with a significant reduction followed by a stable trend."
21,"guangzhou exhibited the best eeq among the four cities, while shanghai experienced continuous deterioration."
21,"notably, nanjing’s eeq showed steady improvement due to ex- tensive efforts in water pollution prevention and control."
21,"overall, this research contributes to the understanding of china’s ecological environment and provides objective, scien- tific, and reliable data support for ecological protection and pollution prevention policies, thereby helping to mitigate potential ecological risks associated with future urbanization in china."
