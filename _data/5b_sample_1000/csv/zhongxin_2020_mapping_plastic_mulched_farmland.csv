2,accurate map of plastic- accepted 7 march 2020 mulched farmland (pmf) is demanded to monitor the usage of plastic mulches and to mitigate its environmental damages.
2,"however, map­ ping pmf with remote sensing data over large scale is still technically challenging due to its variable spectral characteristic."
2,"this paper proposed a random forest (rf) workflow to map pmf by coupling multi-resource satellite observations, including high- and medium- resolution optical imageries and synthetic aperture radar (sar) ima­ geries."
2,"under the context of two typical pmf regions, jizhou and guyuan, china, we test the performance of the proposed method."
2,results indicated that coupling optical and sar remote sensing data improved the mapping accuracy significantly.
2,there were different strategies for optimal data coupling.
2,"coupling of three data, which are the gaofen-1 (gf-1) data, landsat-8 data and radarsat-2 data, gener­ ated the highest mapping accuracy."
2,"besides, coupling the gf-1 data with sar data produced better accuracy than coupling the landsat-8 data with sar data."
2,"compared with the accuracies derived from the coupling of two data (such as coupling gf-1 data with radarsat-2 data and coupling landsat-8 data with radarsat-2 data), coupling the three data improved the overall accuracies by 0.39 to 4.93%."
2,"compared with the mapping accuracy produced from radarsat-2 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling increased by 20.96 and 26.06%, respectively, in jizhou and guyuan."
2,"when compared with the mapping accuracy of gf-1 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling improved by 4.77% both in jizhou and guyuan."
2,"in general, contribution of optical remote sensing data was greater than that of sar data for mapping pmf."
2,"whereas, the sar data also made great contribution to improve the mapping accuracy of pmf."
2,"introduction the practice of plastic mulching (pm) has been globally conducted to increase food production in the modern agriculture by the alternation of crop micro-environment, contact chen zhongxin zhongxin.chen@fao.org information technology division (cio), food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), rome 00153, italy © 2020 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group"
3,7758 hasituya et al. such as increasing soil temperature and conserving water content (bai et al.
3,2010).
3,"pm can efficiently promote crop growth as well as protect crop from drought, coldness and heat waves."
3,"however, such accumulation of plastic materials in soil has incurred critical environmental concerns."
3,"the existing of plastic waste in soil can shift the community structure and functional properties of soil microbes, rendering further effects on the symbiotic systems between plant and mycorrhizae."
3,"as well, the high-reflective nature of pm is potential to change the radiative balance at the early stage of pm application, resulting in disturbances in the local energy cycling."
3,recent studies also demonstrated that the improved crop growth also changes the diurnal and annual processes of water and nutrient at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere layer.
3,"for this reason, geospatially detailed knowledge of pm distribution is important to assess the pros and cons of plastic film application."
3,remote sensing is powerful for acquiring land surface properties with multiple tempo- spatial scales (nordberg and evertson 2003).
3,"over the past decades, mapping land surface with remote sensing data has been increasingly attended."
3,"coupling passive and active remote sensing data to map one-class land cover is particularly popularized, such as water body (subramaniam, babu, and roy 2011; zhou et al. 2014), impervious surface (zhang, zhang, and lin 2014), crop types (nijland et al."
3,"2009; thompson, paull, and lees 2015), and snow and ice (makynen and simila 2015)."
3,"attempts to map plasticulture agriculture, especially plastic-greenhouses, have also been increasing in recent years."
3,"pixel-based algorithms, such as maximum likelihood, support vector machine (svm) and random forest (rf), to classify high-resolution images, like quick-bird (arcidiacono, porto, and cascone 2012; agüera, aguilar, and aguilar 2006; agüera and liu 2009; carvajal et al."
3,"2006; arcidiacono and porto 2011), ikonos (agüera and liu 2009) and worldview-2 (koc- san 2013) has been broadly tested to map plastic-greenhouse."
3,"more recently, object- oriented algorithms were also used to implement this task (aguilar et al."
3,2015; 2014; 2016).
3,"however, the application of high- resolution imageries is limited by data storage, processing efficiency and costs."
3,"to overcome this difficulty, remote sensing data with medium spatial resolution has been used to map plastic-greenhouse (novelli et al."
3,2016; wu et al.
3,2016; yang et al.
3,2017).
3,"however, the first study of mapping plastic-mulched farmland (pmf) with satellite remote sensing data was conducted in xinjiang, china, based on landsat-5 image and decision-tree classifier (lu, di, and ye 2014)."
3,"compared with landsat, moderate-resolu­ tion imaging spectrometer (modis) satellite can provide data over large region with high revisit frequency and can better capture the phenology characteristic."
3,"to this end, the time series modis-normalized difference vegetation index (modis-ndvi) data were used to establish a threshold methodology for mapping pmf in xinjiang after­ wards (lu, hang, and di 2015)."
3,"whereas, spectral index-based threshold-methods mentioned above were limited by its universality across different regions."
3,"in addition, there were also serious mixed pixels in coarse resolution image when mapping small- patched and fragmented agriculture in china."
3,"to solve this problems, the multi- features including spectral features, textural features, index features (i.e."
3,"ndvi, normalized difference built-up index (ndbi), greenness index (gi), and brightness index (bi)), and thermal features from landsat-8 data (acquired from april to july) were considered for mapping pmf in northern china (hasituya et al. 2016; 2017a)."
3,these mentioned studies suggest that the performance of textural features can be
4,international journal of remote sensing 7759 influenced by the spatial resolution of remote sensing data.
4,"textural features derived from high-resolution data, such as gaofen-1 (gf-1), the first satellite of china’s high- resolution earth observation system, have made greater contribution than that of medium resolution data (hasituya and chen 2017)."
4,"in addition, study of mapping pmf with synthetic aperture radar (sar) data (radarsat-2) reported that mapping accuracy has not reach very high level (hasituya et al. 2017b)."
4,"in general, previous studies of mapping pmf were limited to use the optical remote sensing data alone or sar remote sensing data alone."
4,"although optical remote sensing data providing a plenty of spectral information have been successfully applied into land cover classification, cloudy and rainy weather or atmospheric conditions are still the great challenges for obtaining a temporal and spatial continuous data."
4,"in addition, it is difficult to optical remote sensing data for classifying land cover types with similar spectral characteristics as well."
4,"compared with optical remote sensing, sar remote sensing is almost impervious to atmospheric interference and can penetrate cloud cover (turkar et al."
4,2012).
4,"thus, sar data play an important role in special object mapping and land cover classification due to its day and night data availability (de santiago, kovacs, and lafrance 2013; yang et al. 2015a, 2015b); li et al."
4,2012).
4,a number of studies have proved that the introduction of sar data makes great contribution to distinguish land cover types with similar spectral response and the combination of multi-source remote sensing data can provide higher level of accuracy than each sensor used individually (cervone and haack 2012; yang et al.
4,2015).
4,"thus, integrating multi-source remote sensing data have been becoming an important developing stream in land cover mapping now."
4,"in addition, plastic mulching can change surface roughness and soil moisture."
4,"therefore, we hypothesize that sar data have potential for mapping pmf due to the structural information offering and the dielectric property detection."
4,the main goal of this work was to determine whether the coupling of optical and sar remote sensing data can provide powerful information support for mapping pmf.
4,the specific goals were (1) to improve the mapping accuracy of pmf by coupling optical remote sensing data and sar remote sensing data; (2) to confirm the optimum data combination and (3) to establish the optimum combined feature set for map­ ping pmf.
4,study areas and data 2.1.
4,"study areas we selected two typical pmf regions in china (figure 1), i.e."
4,jizhou (mainly the region in 37°29′n to 37°46′n and 115°18′e to 115°37′e) and guyuan (mainly the region in 35°54′n to 36°11′n and 105°58′ to 106°17′e) for mapping pmf.
4,"jizhou, which is located in north china plain, is the favourable agricultural production area with a temperate monsoon climate zone with hot and rainy summer."
4,"the cotton, winter wheat and corn are the major crops in this region, and cotton is the dominant plastic-mulched crops."
4,white transparent plastic film is widely used for cotton production.
4,"land cover/use types in this area include farmland, woodland, grassland, residential land, industrial land and water body and so on."

5,location of study areas and collected samples: (a) location of the study area in guyuan; and (b) location of the study area in jizhou; two scenes of landsat-8 images are displayed in standard false colour synthesis composition.
5,"guyuan, which is located in north-west china, is also an agricultural region with a temperate continental semi-arid climate with less rainfall and more evaporation."
5,pm has been widely practiced for water-saving and increasing the maize yield in this region.
5,the other land use/land cover types are similar to jizhou except for mountainous area.
5,the plastic- covered agricultural region in our study area includes pmf and plastic greenhouse (figure 2).
5,"data data used in study included optical remote sensing data (gf-1 data, landsat-8 data), sar remote sensing data (radarsat-2 data) and field survey data."

6,radarsat-2 satellite image radarsat-2 (huang et al.
6,2017; moran et al.
6,"2012; vanderhoof et al. 2017) images with a spacing width of 25 × 25 km were acquired on 25 april in jizhou and acquired on 27 april in guyuan, respectively."
6,"the collected single-look complex data (slc) were radiometrically calibrated, speckle filtered and terrain corrected using next european space agency (esa) sar toolbox (nest) to minimize the influence of natural condition and to obtain more accurate information from sar data."
6,original data were converted to backscatter coeffi­ cient data by radiometric calibration.
6,lee-refined filtering method was used to remove the speckle noise in a filtering window of 7 × 7 pixels.
6,"finally, the geometric correction was carried out and the images were re-sampled to 8 m resolution data in db format."
6,2.2.2.
6,gf-1 satellite image gf-1 is a widely used high-resolution earth observation satellite launched by china.
6,gf-1 satellite carries panchromatic multispectral sensor (pms) and wide of field view (wfv) sensors.
6,"the pms image has four multispectral channels of visible and near-infrared (blue band, green band, red band and near infrared band) spectral domain with 8 m resolution and a panchromatic channel with 2 m resolution."
6,gf-1 pms image used in this study and its advantages are the high spatial resolution that provides more detailed structural information and high revisiting frequency that can capture the key period of mapping ground objects.
6,"considering mulching periods, gf-1 image in jizhou is acquired on 5 may and in guyuan is acquired on 8 april."
6,the radiance calibration and atmospheric correction were performed in the environment for visualizing images (envi) software.
6,2.2.3.
6,landsat-8 satellite image medium resolution landsat-8 data were the most frequently used earth observation data for effective mapping of land cover types and quantitative inversion of land surface parameters due to their spatial and temporal advantages.
6,"thus, we also discussed the application of landsat-8 images combining with radarsat-2 images to map pmf."
6,the landsat-8 images taken in jizhou on 16 april and taken in guyuan on 26 april were selected.
6,the radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction were carried out using the fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes (flaash) module of the envi software.
6,then all the landsat-8 images were clipped by the region of selected radarsat-2 images.
6,the pmf appeared differently in optical images and sar images.
6,the differences can be seen from figure 3.

7,"field survey data we conducted field survey during 25 to 30 april and 23 to 26 june in jizhou and guyuan, respectively, to gather the reference samples of land cover types."
7,"in field survey, gps was used to record the location of field samples and label the land cover types."
7,several land cover types in these two study areas are displayed in table 1.
7,a number of point samples for each land cover types were collected randomly.
7,"afterwards, the samples were enlarged to polygon samples with a size of 40 × 40 m by visual interpreting the gf-1 image based on field point samples."
7,the total number of collected samples were 708 in jizhou and 653 in guyuan.
7,the samples of each study area were then equally divided into two groups: training samples and testing samples.
7,methodology an optimum use of features can improve significantly the land cover mapping perfor­ mance.
7,the main idea of this work is to optimize the features for pmf mapping by coupling spectral information derived from optical remote sensing data (gf-1 and landsat-8) with the backscattering information and polarimetric decomposition descrip­ tors derived from radarsat-2 data.
7,"the workflow (figure 4) of this study consists of three steps: feature extraction, feature optimizing and pmf mapping."

8,"features from optical remote sensing data spectral reflectance of gf-1 data (four bands, gf_blue, gf_green, gf_red, gf_near infrared (gf_ nir)) and landsat-8 data (seven bands, lc8_coastal, lc8_blue, lc8_green, lc8_red, lc8_nir, lc8_short wave infrared-1 (lc8_swir1), lc8_swir2) after radiance calibration and atmosphere correction were used as spectral features of optical remote sensing."
8,3.1.2.
8,"features from sar remote sensing data the backscattering intensity of four polarizations, vertical-horizontal (vh), horizontal- vertical (hv), horizontal-horizontal (hh) and vertical-vertical (vv) were used in current study."
8,"in addition, due to the helpful of polarimetric decomposition descriptors for mapping land cover types (http://earth.eo.esa.int/polsarpro/), four polarimetric decom­ position algorithms that are krogager polarimetric decomposition, freeman polarimetric decomposition, entropy/anisotropy/alpha (h/a/alpha) polarimetric decomposition and yamaguchi4 polarimetric decomposition algorithms were applied to extract polarimetric decomposition descriptors from radarsat-2 data in this study."
8,"initially, the 3 × 3 covariance matrix, which allows the polarization intensity of different polarizations to be extracted for further analysis, was calculated from the radarsat-2 full- polarization data."
8,"the coherency matrix t3, which contained all the polarimetric informa­ tion, was extracted by using polarimetric sar data processing and education toolbox"
9,7764 hasituya et al.
9,"(polsarpro) software (van beijma, comber, and lamb 2014, european space agency 2011)."
9,"the different polarimetric decomposition algorithms were applied for t3 (t11, t22, t33) matrix to extract the polarimetric decomposition descriptors."
9,"then, the polarimetric decom­ position descriptors were combined with the features from the optical remote sensing data to form the different feature combinations of optical and sar remote sensing data."
9,the main polarimetric decomposition algorithms were briefly introduced as follows.
9,"the h/a/ alpha decomposition algorithm, which was developed originally by cloude and pottier, provide three decomposition descriptors of alpha (α), entropy (h) and anisotropy (a) (wang et al."
9,2007; you et al.
9,"2014; krogager, boerner, and madsen 1997)."
9,"the value of α ranges from 0° to 90° and denotes physical scattering mechanism. 0° refer to the surface scattering mechanism, 0° < α < 45° refer to the dipole scattering and 45° < α < 90° refer to the dihedral angle scattering."
9,and equal to 90° is the dihedral or helix scattering.
9,h represents the randomness of scattering.
9,its value ranges from 0 to 1 and the scattering mechanism is changed from complete polarization to complete random scattering.
9,the a is a supplement to the h.
9,"in addition to these three polarimetric decomposition descriptors, we also selected the combination_1mh1 ma (the high entropy multiple scattering parameters, c_1mh1 ma), the combination_1mha (the high entropy plane scattering parameters, c_1mha), the combination_h1 ma (the low entropy multiple scattering parameters, c_ h1 ma), and the combination_ha (the low entropy plane scattering parameters, c_ha) from the h/a/alpha decomposition algorithm as input features."
9,"three descriptors derived from krogager decomposition algorithm include helix (kh, helix scattering component, k_ kh), diplane (kd, diplane scattering component, k_ kd) and sphere (ks, surface scattering component, k_ks) (duguay et al."
9,2016).
9,"the freeman decomposition is a method for decomposing the scattering mechanism into surface scattering (f_odd), double-bounce scattering (f_dbl) and volume scattering (f_vol) that can provide features for distinguishing the land cover types with different scattering mechanism (wang et al."
9,2007).
9,"the yamaguchi4 decomposition parameters introduce helix scattering (y_hlx) to the original three decomposition parameters of freeman decomposition (y_odd, y_dbl, y_vol) (yamaguchi et al."
9,"2005; gislason, benediktsson, and sveinsson 2006)."
9,3.1.3.
9,"feature sets developing the efficiency of object recognition is directly related to its electronic wave characteristic, scale size and the data specification."
9,the coupling of multi-source data can make con­ tribution to improve the mapping accuracy in a certain degree (cervone and haack 2012).
9,we developed three strategies for feature combination using the features extracted from optical remote sensing data and sar remote sensing data respectively.
9,"the strategies include coupling features from gf-1 data with the features from radarsat-2 data (includ­ ing 28 features), coupling the features from landsat-8 data with that from radarsat-2 data (including 31 features) and coupling the features from gf-1 data and landsat-8 data with that from radarsat-2 data (including 35 features)."
9,machine learning algorithms and accuracy assessment we used a rf machine-learning algorithm to assess feature importance and to map pmf in our study areas.
10,international journal of remote sensing 7765 3.2.1.
10,"random forest rf, a supervised machine learning classifier developed by breiman in 2001 (mahdianpari et al. 2017), has been extensively used in many applications with respect to the land use/cover classification and landscape ecology, due to the multiple advantages inherent to its basic classifier of a classification tree (rodriguez-galiano et al."
10,2012).
10,"moreover, rf is easy to operate because only two parameters (the number of trees and the number of split variables) are required."
10,optimized result can be obtained by selecting optimum number of trees and split variables.
10,"furthermore, rf can avoid the problem of over-fitting by generating a large number of trees to ensure the generalization of the patterns in the data (guan et al."
10,2013).
10,"additionally, rf can provide variable importance by estimating the accuracy difference between the permuted and original out-of-bag samples."
10,"compared to univariate screening methods, the superiority of rf feature importance measure is that rf not only includes the influence of each variable individually, but also includes the influence of multivariate interactions with other variables (guan et al."
10,2013).
10,this makes rf more efficient and accurate than the other algorithm.
10,a detailed process for measuring the importance of features by rf was presented by guan et al.
10,(2013).
10,"in our experiment, rf was used both to assess the importance of features and to map the pmf."
10,"a total of 500 trees were set for each classification, and the square root of the total number of input features were set as the number of split variables in this study."
10,3.2.2.
10,accuracy assessment the confusion matrix was used to assess mapping accuracy of this study.
10,"overall accuracy (oa) and kappa coefficient (k), producer’s accuracy (pa) and user’s accuracy (ua) were applied in this study."
10,the mapping accuracies were further evaluated by mcnemar test as well.
10,the mcnemar test is used to determine if there are differences on a dichotomous dependent variable between two related groups.
10,"if the statistical significance level (i.e. p-value) is less than 0.05 (i.e. p < 0.05), there have a statistically significant result and significant difference between two different analysis."

10,importance of features from data couplings 4.1.1.
10,"importance of features from gf-1 and radarsat-2 data coupling to explore whether optical remote sensing data (gf-1) and sar remote sensing data (radarsat-2) can show their respective advantages in pmf mapping, we used rf algorithm to assess the importance of features including four spectral reflectance bands from gf-1 data, the backscattering intensity and polarimetric decomposition descriptors from radarsat-2 data."
10,figure 5 shows that the contribution of gf-1 was significantly greater than that of radarsat-2 data for mapping pmf in these two study areas.
10,"in jizhou, the four spectral reflectance bands of gf-1 data ranked in the order of blue band, nir band, green band and red band, respectively."
10,"whereas, in features from radarsat-2 data, the contribution of the descriptors derived from the h/a/alpha polarimetric decomposition was greater than that derived from the other polarimetric decomposition algorithms."
10,"among them, alpha, entropy, c_h1 ma and c_1mh1 ma were the most important features."

11,"in jizhou, the top 10 important features were ranked as lc8_red band, lc8_swir2 band, lc8_nir band, lc8_green band, alpha, lc8_blue band, lc8_coastal band, entropy and f_vol."
11,"in guyuan, lc8_nir band, lc8_coastal band, lc8_green band, lc8_red band, lc8_swir2 band, lc8_blue band, lc8_swir1 band, alpha, vh and hv were listed as the top 10 important features."
11,4.1.3.
11,"importance of features from gf-1 data, landsat-8 data and radarsat-2 data coupling as presented in figure 7, the optical remote sensing data (gf-1 and landsat-8) were more advantageous than the sar remote sensing data (radarsat-2) in mapping pmf as well."
11,"in jizhou, gf-1 data were observed the most important data source, followed by the medium spatial resolution landsat-8 data and radarsat-2 data in the three remote sensing data combination."
11,"among the features from sar data, the h/a/alpha decom­ position descriptors were more important than the other, such as alpha, entropy."
11,"the gf- 1 dominated in mapping pmf, followed by landsat-8 data."
11,it can be observed that the spatial resolution of optical remote sensing data has a great influence on the mapping efficiency.

13,"whereas, the spatial resolution of optical remote sensing data has a great influence on mapping efficiency of pmf with remote sensing data."
13,"mapping accuracies for comparing the efficiency of data couplings, we also applied the same classifier for mapping pmf using single data (gf-1, landsat-8 and radarsat-2 independently)."
13,table 2 and figure 8 demonstrate the mapping accuracies generated different data couplings.
13,the mapping accuracies obtained from multi-source data couplings were higher than that from each individual data.
13,"the studies in these two study areas illustrated the same characteristic that the highest mapping accuracy was obtained by coupling three types of data, followed by the coupling of two types of data (gf-1 data and radarsat-2 data)."
13,"to verify the significance of difference between different data couplings, the mcnemar test (table 3) were applied in this study."
13,it can be seen that all the mcnemar test value were all less than 0.05.
13,this means that the performance of different data couplings was significantly differed from each other and the mapping accuracy was improved consider­ ably by coupling different satellite data.
13,"in jizhou, the mapping accuracies generated from three data coupling were higher than that from the other data source."

15,"therefore, when using single-temporal data, coupling multi-source data can make great contribution to improve the mapping accuracy of pmf."
15,we also can observe that there were differences in accuracy improvement between these two study areas.
15,the accuracy improvement in guyuan was higher than that in jizhou.
15,spatial distribution of pmf obtained from data couplings figure 9 shows the spatial distribution of pmf in jizhou and guyuan respectively obtained from the different couplings of remote sensing data.
15,"the spatial patterns of pmf obtained from the data couplings were similar in a certain degree, but not exactly the same."
15,the results from the data couplings were more reasonable and acceptable in these two study areas.
15,the most obvious differences were observed between the results from data combination and the result from single sar data.
15,there was severe salt-pepper effect in the result from single sar data.
15,that is to say that the commission and omission error were more serious in the result from sar data.
15,"when coupling the optical remote sensing data with sar remote sensing data, the commission and omission error was relieved obviously."
15,"especially, the couplings of three types of data (gf-1, landsat-8 and radarsat-2) can provide the most reasonable results compared with the coupling the two types of data (coupling gf-1 data with radarsat-2 data and coupling landsat-8 data with radarsat-2 data)."
15,"therefore, we can conclude that there were good complementa­ rities between optical remote sensing data and sar remote sensing data for map­ ping pmf in northern china."
15,"discussion recent studies have reported that coupling optical remote sensing data and sar remote sensing data could be beneficial to improve the mapping accuracy of land cover types, particularly to map a special land cover type (cervone and haack 2012)."
15,the optical satellite (gf-1 and landsat-8) can offer valuable data source for mapping pmf in northern china (hasituya et al. 2016; 2017a; hasituya and chen 2017).
15,"thus, we hypothesise that the sar remote sensing has potential for mapping pmf due to its ability to penetrate the cloud cover and to provide structural information."
15,"therefore, in this study, we sought to couple the optical remote sensing data (gf-1 data and landsat-8 data) and sar remote sensing data (radarsat-2 data) (hasituya et al. 2017b) across two different regions in order to determine whether it can improve the pmf mapping accuracy nor not."
15,"effectiveness of coupling optical and sar remote sensing data optical remote sensing data contain the information regarding to the surface reflectance and emissivity characteristics, while sar remote sensing data capture the information concerning to the structure and dielectric properties of earth surface."
15,"because of complementary information contained in these two types of data, the land cover types that are impossible to be separated in optical remote"
16,international journal of remote sensing 7771 figure 9.
16,"the spatial distribution of pmf in jizhou (left column) and in guyuan (right column): (a) and (e) are the results from the coupling the gf-1 and radarsat-2 data; (b) and (f) are the results from the coupling the landsat-8 and radarsat-2 data, (c) and (g) are the result from the coupling the gf-1, landsat-8 and radarsat-2 data; and (d) and (h) are the results from the radarsat-2 data alone respectively in jizhou and guyuan."
17,7772 hasituya et al. sensing data can become distinguishable with the help of sar remote sensing data.
17,optical remote sensing data were hindered by similar spectral reflectance of different land cover types.
17,sar remote sensing data have been limited by inherent speckle noise.
17,"most of plastic film used in china is transparent or white coloured, thus their surface reflectance characteristic is very similar with the bare soil and fallow land in optical image."
17,the confusion between pmf and bare soil or impervious surface was observed to be very severe as presented in previous studies (hasituya et al. 2016; 2017a; hasituya and chen 2017).
17,"however, pmf in northern china have a relatively distinct spatial pattern and one of the effects of pm is to save soil water content."
17,"therefore, its structural characteristics and dielectric properties are differed from bare soil and impervious surface on sar image."
17,"due to the penetration of sar, it can detect the moisture under the plastic film, which is higher than non-plastic-mulched area (such as bare soil)."
17,this makes the differences between pmf and bare soil more detectable in sar image than other data.
17,"thus, by coupling optical data and sar remote sensing data, the inherent speckle noise of sar data has been suppressed in certain level."
17,the significant improvement in mapping accuracy is suffice to prove that sar remote sensing data provide the information which is complementary to that captured by optical remote sensing data.
17,such complementarity of optical and sar remote sensing data have been demonstrated in earlier studies (lehmann et al.
17,2015).
17,"in addition, the all-weather and all-day capability of sar data allow us to obtain more reliable earth observation data in the regions with cloudy and rainy weather and the regions with severe haze pollution."
17,"thus, application of sar data has great potential in mapping pmf in the regions with rainy and cloudy weather, such as southern region of china."
17,contribution of optical and sar remote sensing data the present study indicated that optical remote sensing data were more important than sar remote sensing data in the multi-source data couplings.
17,"that was related to acquiring time of data, land cover classification scheme and the inherent characteristics of different types of data."
17,all data used in this study were acquired in april.
17,"the crops (except for the winter wheat) in these two study areas were still in very early growth stages and, thus, most of the structural features (except for buildings and greenhouses) are not so obvious, while the spectral reflectance of the land cover types is differed significantly, especially reflectance of pmf in april."
17,"in april, the farmland is just after pm and has not been influenced by the dust, rain, irrigation or other elements."
17,"therefore, the surface of pmf is brighter than the other land cover types, and the spectral reflectance characteristic is significantly differed from the other land cover types."
17,the land cover classification scheme includes five land cover types in jizhou and seven land cover types in guyuan.
17,"the reflectance characteristic is more significant than back-scattering characteristics for many land-cover types, such as pmf, water body and bare soil."
17,for vegetation cover and impervious
18,"international journal of remote sensing 7773 surface, there are equal reflectance characteristic and back-scattering characteristics."
18,"in addition, the usage of sar data is influenced by the inherent speckle noise that weaken the prominent characteristics of special land cover type and the difference between different land cover types."
18,"however, there are no such problems in optical remote sensing data."
18,"thus, at the last, the optical remote sensing data have more advantages over the sar remote sensing data for mapping pmf at this period of mulching."
18,"influence of spatial resolution on different optical remote sensing data comparing these two optical remote sensing data, the main differences is the spatial resolution and the spectral bands design."
18,"landsat-8 satellite carries seven bands (the coastal band, blue band, green band, red band, nir band, swir1 and swir2 band) with 30 m spatial resolution."
18,"gf-1 carries four bands (blue band, green band, red band, nir band) with 8 m spatial resolution."
18,"actually, the most difference between these two data is the spatial resolution."
18,"in addition, the farmland in china is small patched and fragmented (no exception to pmf)."
18,"therefore, the mixed pixels existed more frequent and serious in landsat-8 data than that in gf-1 data."
18,many valuable information are blocked by the mixed pixels in pmf mapping using landsat-8 data.
18,"thus, it can be inferred that the high spatial resolution gf-1 data are superior to the medium resolution landsat-8 data for mapping the pmf in northern china."
18,un-mixing the confused pixels in med­ ium resolution remote sensing data for mapping pmf will be the main considera­ tion of the further work.
18,comparison with previous studies table 4 shows the accuracies obtained from the previous research for mapping pmf with remote sensing data.
18,all these studies used the single-source optical remote sensing data.
18,the multi-source remote sensing data have never been used to map pmf until now.
18,"definitely, the mapping accuracies obtained from the single-source optical remote sensing data were acceptable."
18,"however, coupling the sar and optical remote sensing data have their unique advantages over the single-source remote sensing data for mapping land cover types."
18,it is well known that sar data can provide table 4.

19,"in addition, sar data can record the structural information and the dielectric properties of land covers, which is hard to be provided by the optical remote sensing data."
19,"therefore, the sar data can be the important compensation for optical remote sensing in mapping pmf."
19,"the overall, the producer’s and the user’s accuracies generated from this study were higher than or at the equal level with the accuracies from the previous studies."
19,"however, comparing with the other studies, there are a significant differ­ ence that all the overall, producer’s and the user’s accuracies were achieved the same level of 95.00% simultaneously when coupling the sar and optical remote sensing data."
19,"this was not observed in other studies (lu, di, and ye 2014; zhang, zhang, and lin 2014; lu, hang, and di 2015; hasituya et al. 2016; 2017a; 2017b; hasituya and chen 2017)."
19,this illustrated that coupling the multi-source data is beneficial to improve the mapping accuracy and efficiency.
19,"moreover, just the spectral reflectance of optical remote sensing data has been tested in this study, and the other features of textural or indexes have not been considered."
19,this result is sufficient to prove the efficiency of coupling the optical remote sensing data with sar remote sensing data.
19,"conclusion this study presents an approach for mapping pmf by coupling multi-source remote sensing data, including coupling sar remote sensing data with high spatial resolution optical remote sensing data (gf-1 data) and medium spatial resolution remote sensing data (landsat-8 data)."
19,"the results indicated that the most important features are obtained from the optical remote sensing data, especially the features from the high spatial resolution optical remote sensing data."
19,"nonetheless, the inclusion of sar descriptors has been found to improve the mapping accuracy considerably."
19,"according to our study, we suggest: (1) coupling multi-source remote sensing data can effectively improve the mapping accuracy of pmf."
19,the different individual remote sensing data have a significant contribu­ tion for data couplings.
19,(2) there were differences between different data couplings.
19,"the highest mapping accuracy was obtained from the coupling of three data (gf-1 data, landsat-8 data and the radarsat-2 data)."
19,the mapping accuracy from the coupling of gf-1 data and radarsat-2 data was higher than that from the coupling of landsat-8 and radarsat-2 data.
19,(3) the contribution of optical remote sensing data was greater than that of sar remote sensing data in different coupling strategies for pmf mapping.
19,"however, sar data made also great contribution to map pmf."
19,"we recommend that coupling multi-source data from more sensors and more dimensions of features, which complement to each other, can improve the mapping accuracy of pmf significantly."
19,there is a need to make further investigation into the use of multi-source remote sensing data sets with regard to map other land cover types.
