1,species distribution models (sdms) and remote sensing (rs) methods accepted 11 september 2015 have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage.
1,"however, previous available online 22 september 2015 work integrating these two methods has rarely used rs metrics that have biological meaning."
1,"we use rs difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map hemlock woolly keywords: adelgid (hwa), adelges tsugae, locations using maxent in the delaware water gap national recreation hemlock woolly adelgid remote sensing area (dwgnra)."
1,"brightness, greenness, wetness, and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) maxent were calculated from landsat thematic mapper (tm) images for december 1982 and 2010."
1,a difference species distribution model for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value.
1,"we compared two models, wetness one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to ndvi determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance."
1,"variables with low importance were removed from both models, leav- ing ndvi, wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models."
1,"the difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values."
1,"despite this small difference in accu- racy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1% of total area) was approximately ½ of that predicted by the single year model (9.6% of total area)."
1,"these results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50%, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach."
1,this method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat.

6,the greenness difference for all 75 plots was negative (i.e. on the entire study area we compared the mean and standard deviation for our plot rois compared to areas outside of our plots.
6,"areas outside of the plot rois show greenness decreased), and this index was negatively correlated opposite difference in the indices meaning that the vegetation was healthier in these with hemlock damage. areas."
6,"the ndvi difference was likewise negative across all 75 plots index mean sd plot y/n due to hwa caused defoliation, this agrees with the previous research when taking into account that they subtracted the newest ndvi difference 0.14 0.01897 y wetness difference 0.025 0.00100 y from the oldest image (royle and lathrop, 2002)."
6,"however, it was brightness difference 0.041 0.00126 y positively correlated with hemlock damage which differs from greenness difference 0.0027 0.00155 y royle and lathrop (2002), most likely due to the time since hwa ndvi difference 0.085 0.06708 n in the park being 5 years for their study and 20 years for our study."
6,"wetness difference 0.031 0.07616 n ndvi difference became less negative with increasing hemlock brightness difference 0.038 0.07141 n greenness difference 0.0026 0.05831 n damage likely due to the high damage stands having greater light availability to the understory, potentially allowing the r. maximum understory in these forest types to grow rapidly (fig."
6,"2) (ford et al., 2012)."
6,"in contrast, the wetness differential was positive for all 75 plots, indicating less canopy moisture following disturbance, and was positively correlated with hemlock damage (fig."
6,"this is due to the fact the health undamaged conifer stands have a more negative wetness index (song et al., 2007)."
6,thus positive wetness difference corresponds to more severe hwa damage.
6,"although rhododendron is evergreen, retaining high levels of leaf biomass through the winter (thus increasing ndvi values), the leaves do not open their stoma when temperatures are below freezing, as was likely the case in these winter images, and thus appear to have a lower wetness index than other evergreen vegetation (chastain and townsend, 2007)."
6,"this is a possible explanation for why even though ndvi difference declined with increasing hemlock damage, the wetness difference increases with increasing hemlock damage, because r. maximum increases ndvi values in the winter as it is evergreen but has little effect on wetness."
6,"in the future, a study of this nature looking at the temporal aspects hwa spread to see at what time step this method would be most useful would be extremely valuable."

6,this shows that accuracy is improved with the difference model. effects of aspect and slope on hwa infestations.
6,"however, our analysis suggests that there is little effect of these variables in this to the previously mapped hemlock forest types by the usda nps portion of the range."

6,"discussion and conclusions loams, very cobbly sandy loams, and complex; all soil types were in areas classified as extremely stony, very rocky, or rubbly and very for the 75 affected stands, the brightness index increased from acid."

6,"however, highly acidic (rogers, 1980; godman and lancaster, 1990; ward the brightness difference index was negatively correlated with et al., 2004)."
6,the results of the maxent models suggest that using hemlock damage (table 2).
6,"as discussed previously, r. maximum remote sensing difference indices improves model performance grows more rapidly following hemlock loss than other understory slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreased predicted species and is a dominate component in the understory in 3 of the area of forest infestation by about 50%, and decreased amount of 4 hemlock forest types."
6,"this leads us to believe that this rapid area predicted outside of hemlock forest substantially from 39.2% growth of r. maximum is dampening the soil brightness signal in for the 2010 model to 10.94% for the difference model of the total plots that have higher damage, which are predominately in the area predicted by the models."
