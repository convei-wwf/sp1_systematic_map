2,its future will depend upon how the systems meet the demand of monitoring global environment: mapping. charting and geodesy: long-term global change research and assessment; monitoring and managing the renewable and non-renewable resources and national security applications.
2,the future earth obser- vation systems (eos) will have to take into consideration the aspects relate to the globalisation and standardisation of programmes world-over; data continuity and the need to monitor processes rather than events.
2,"technological changes are also going to re-define many of the concepts of ob- servation from space and issues like spatial resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution may no more be a concern for observation systems. in the indian context, with the launch of irs- i c. in december 1995. user services have been significantly enhanced."
2,"presently, plans are onway to define the continuity to these missions."
2,a broad analysis has been done of the observation needs of the future and also what has been achieved today and suggestions are made for the future observation systems design and implemen- tation.
2,the need analysis has been done keeping in mind the global change applications: mapping and cartographic applications: natural resources and environmental management applications etc.
2,the paper discusses the strategy adopted for assessing the future requirements and also for defining the future indian missions.
2,"based on this evaluation and also the need for identifying low-cost. quick turn-around. application specific solutions, candidate payloads for the continuation series have been defined."
2,these candidate payloads cater to a majority of the application needs and specific gap-areas would be taken care of.
2,"a decade profile of indian remote sensing missions has been defined which addresses the concept of continuity, operational missions and the advanced missions up to 2005."
