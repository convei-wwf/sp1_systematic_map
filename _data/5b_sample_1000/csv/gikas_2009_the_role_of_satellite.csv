1,"with recent technological ad- vances in wastewater treatment, it is now possible to produce reclaimed water of any quality."
1,"thus, the use of reclaimed water will depend on the reuse opportunities and the cost of the required infrastructure."
1,"historically, centralized wastewater treatment facilities have served the needs of organized societies since the mid 1800s."
1,"however, as there are limited options for expansion of most existing centralized facilities, the use of satellite and decen- tralized wastewater management systems offers significant advantages including being close both to the source of wastewater generation and to potential water reuse applications."
1,the comparative advantages of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems for a number of water reuse applications are presented and discussed in this paper.
1,selected case studies are presented to demonstrate the utility of satellite and decentralized waste- water management.
1,specific issues associated with the application of such systems in existing and in new developments are examined and discussed.
