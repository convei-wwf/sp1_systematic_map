1,introduction published maps and institutional affil- iations.
1,roads are one of the primary drivers of human-caused environmental change affecting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems globally [1].
1,"there is growing recognition that the ecological implications of roads are complex and far-reaching, and an entirely new scientific field of road ecology has emerged to better understand the direct and indirect effects of roads on ecological systems and wildlife populations [2]."
1,"in particular, there is mounting copyright: © 2021 by the authors. evidence that indirect and cumulative effects of roads on wildlife behaviour and health may licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. be especially pervasive [2]."
1,"central to this understanding is the need to characterize roads this article is an open access article according to their physical attributes (e.g., width, road surface) and how they are used distributed under the terms and conditions of the creative commons by people (e.g., traffic volume, travel speed, vehicle type)."

2,"this is especially true in human dominated landscapes where roads are needed to extract natural resources [3,4]."
2,"road use can dramatically alter direct and indirect impacts on wildlife, irrespective of its physical footprint."
2,"direct effects may include the increased accessibility of landscapes by users, which may increase wildlife mortality from hunting, poaching or road accidents."
2,"indirect effects may include reduced landscape connectivity and permeability, which can make it difficult for wildlife populations—especially species with large home ranges—to access resources, disperse, or find mates [2,5,6]."
2,"for example, in areas where grizzly bear populations are fragmented by roads, limited connectivity can reduce genetic diversity of the metapopulation and therefore threaten the viability of small sub-populations [7]."
2,"similar results have been found for other species (e.g., [8])."
2,"the thresholds of road use at which these direct and indirect impacts occur are likely different across species and landscapes [1], making it imperative to develop practical methods to characterize and quantify road use for mitigation and conservation applications."
2,"there is evidence that north american populations of brown bear (ursus arctos; hereafter grizzly bear) residing in human dominated landscapes are negatively affected by both the direct and indirect impact of roads [5], making them a useful case study to develop and evaluate methods to characterize road use."
2,"for example, roads used for recreation and resource extraction activities are frequently associated with high-value habitat that attracts grizzly bears [5,9–11], which can increase the risk of human-caused mortality [3,12–14]."
2,"this risk is related to both the attractiveness of roadside habitats, as well as the type and intensity of human activity occurring along the road [15]."
2,"there is some evidence that if road traffic is high enough, grizzly bears may begin to avoid roaded areas altogether [12,16], especially during the day [17] and in certain seasons [5]."
2,"if so, bears may be forgoing critical food resources, which can lead to negative impacts on body condition and survival [9,18]."
2,"widespread efforts to track wildlife movement—e.g., using collars equipped with global positioning systems (gps)—have provided insight into the fine-scale behavioural patterns of how individual animals use habitats across large geographic areas."
2,"however, data on road characteristics covering equivalent extents is rarely available and is difficult to update frequently to match animal gps locations."
2,"these challenges are even more pronounced for unpaved rural roads, which are often developed for natural resource ex- traction purposes, but also publicly accessible."
2,"previous studies looking at the behavioural response of wildlife to unpaved roads rarely characterize details about the roads, and instead treat them as equal (e.g., [3,4,19]) or focus on relatively small areas for which road characteristic data can be measured on the ground (e.g., [17,20])."
2,monitoring road characteristics using ground data is difficult to scale up across space and time.
2,industrial and forestry road networks are especially challenging given that they change frequently to access new locations and roads may be deactivated after resource extraction activities are complete [21].
2,"as the field of road ecology grows, and questions increase in urgency and focus around the placement and use of roads by people, there is the need to develop consistent methods to accurately estimate road characteristics and associated human activity at land- scape scales relevant to managers."
2,"large remote sensing archives (e.g., satellite imagery) and other free databases (e.g., social media posts) can provide not only the location of roads [22], but new information to track patterns of human behaviour, which in turn can help to characterize roads."
2,"for example, data from social media platforms have been used to estimate geographic distribution of tourism and recreation in urban areas [23,24], in na- tional parks and protected areas [25,26] and at the global scale [27]."
2,data from smartphone apps have been used to track commuter patterns [28] and road surface quality [29].
2,satellite imagery has been used to estimate the quality [30] and safety [31] of roads.
2,"however, to the best of our knowledge, these datasets and methodologies have not been combined to characterize unpaved roads in a way applicable to wildlife conservation efforts."
2,"in this study, we sought to address the need for characterizing human activity on unpaved roads in critical wildlife habitat."
2,"specifically, we introduce two novel methods to classify off-"
3,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 2547 3 of 21 highway, unpaved roads across a large management area of grizzly bear habitat in alberta, canada using remote sensing, social media, and crowd-sourced data collected from mobile devices."
3,"the first method was a ‘network-based’ approach using circuit theory to estimate the intensity of human activity across the road network by connecting hotspots identified from social media posts, public databases, and remotely detected disturbances."
3,"the second method was an ‘image-based’ approach, in which we modeled road surface conditions and travel speed from spectral attributes derived from high spatial resolution satellite imagery that was trained with crowd-sourced data voluntarily collected from smartphones."
3,our primary research objectives were threefold.
3,"first, we described the two novel methods (network-based and image-based) to characterize road use in critical wildlife habitat where traffic data is not available."
3,"second, we compared these two methods to each other and a ‘reference’ road classification derived from a detailed public database managed by the provincial government."
3,"we note that the reference classification does not represent a true ground-truth, but rather represents the best currently available characterization approach, which is known to be imperfect yet is still rarely available for most regions."
3,"thus, it serves as an informative comparison."
3,"third, we evaluated the utility of all three characterization methods in the context of modeling wildlife (i.e., grizzly bear) behaviour and habitat use compared to the assumption that all off-highway roads have equal human activity."
3,"an in-depth evaluation of how roads and road use influence grizzly bear behaviour and habitat use was beyond this scope of this study, and has been covered elsewhere (e.g., [3,5,17,19,32])."
3,"rather, we sought to understand the degree to which the three road characterization approaches (network-based, image-based and reference) captured infor- mation about roads that is meaningful when evaluating their impact on wildlife, and specifically whether the two new approaches (network-based, and image-based) yielded useful characterizations in the absence of detailed road data (e.g., the reference classifi- cation)."
3,"since grizzly bears are expected to elicit behavioural shifts in response to traffic, including increased nocturnal activity [17], we therefore evaluated if the three road char- acterizations influenced daytime and nighttime movement and habitat selection patterns observed in grizzly bears based on gps collar locations."
3,"for comparison of the three charac- terization approaches, each approach placed individual road segments into rankings of low, medium, or high human activity levels, which are described in the subsequent sections."
3,materials and methods 2.1.
3,"study area this study focused on unpaved roads within the yellowhead bear management area (bma 3), covering approximately 28,774 km2 in west-central alberta, canada for an interior population of grizzly bears."
3,"the area follows a distinct east–west gradient with the western extents comprised of alpine and sub-alpine sections of the canadian rocky mountains, whereas central and eastern sections are comprised of montane forest as well as upper and lower foothills [33]."
3,"the central and eastern portions outside of jasper national park are highly fragmented by unpaved road networks constructed for oil and gas exploration, agri- culture, timber harvesting, coal mining, and wildfire suppression (figure 1)."
3,"recreational activities are varied and widespread throughout the region and include hiking, camping, hunting, biking and off-road motorsports (e.g., atvs, motorcycles)."
3,"many of the unpaved roads have ‘unimproved’ surfaces and are built for short term resource extraction activities rather than permanent access, and recreation activities along these roads may be inhibited by gates, barriers, seasonal closures or complete road deactivation once industrial activities cease."
3,"other unpaved roads built as throughways to towns or to access mines are more permanent with improved gravel surfaces, ongoing maintenance and uninhibited access."

4,"human activity data for use in the network-based classification, we derived locations of human activity representing three types: (1) general activities (e.g., recreation and commerce); (2) oil and gas exploration and development; and (3) forest harvesting."
4,the latter two represent the main natural resource extraction activities that occur in the region.
4,"we located general activities from posts to multiple social media platforms, specifically: flickr, facebook,"
5,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 2547 5 of 21 google and wikilocs."
5,"we chose to combine platforms in order to capture a larger number of users, and account for the possibility of different usage patterns and activity types for different platforms [26]."
5,"in addition to locations of activity, we also quantified the intensity of activity at each location as follows."
5,"for flickr data, we used their application programming interface (api) to extract photos for every centre-point in a 0.005-degree grid over the study area and counted the number of unique users that had posted photos within 500 m of each point."
5,"for facebook data, we used their api to search for every named location within the study area and extracted the coordinates and the number of ‘check-ins’ for each location."
5,"for google data, we used their api to locate every named place in the study area and then programmed a web browser to extract the number of reviews for each named place."
5,"for wikilocs, a website of user-shared trails locations and information, we manually downloaded each available gps track in the study area, extracted the start location of the track and the number of times the track had been downloaded."
5,initial locations and intensity values for each social media platform are shown in supplementary materials: figure s1.
5,we filtered all locations to select those within 1 km of an unpaved road and ‘snapped’ the remaining locations to the nearest unpaved road.
5,"therefore, posts within 1 km of each other were combined into a single location with a summed intensity value."
5,"we scaled the intensity values to the maximum of the study area for each respective social media platform, and combined posts from the four platforms into a single overall intensity value (figure 2a)."
5,"this was done to account for the fact that we did not restrict the time frame of location or intensity data, but rather included all data available on the date that data extraction occurred (approximately december 2018)."
5,"the data, therefore, represent the cumulative activity across the landscape from when social media use became widespread (roughly 2005~2010) through approximately 2018."
5,"by combining datasets only after scaling each dataset separately, we sought to account for the fact that some platforms have been around longer than others and had different numbers of locations with data (supplementary materials: table s1)."
5,"to identify locations of oil and gas activity, we extracted active well sites from the alberta biodiversity monitoring institute’s 2016 human footprint database [34] (figure 2b)."
5,"for locations of recent forest logging, we used satellite-detections of forest harvesting that occurred between 2014 and 2016 from the landsat-derived forest change detection product originally developed in 2015 by [35] and updated in 2018 (figure 2c)."
5,2.3.2.
5,classification method we used “circuit theory” to develop a road classification approach based on the connection between known locations of human activity along the road network.
5,circuit theory is a connectivity model based on the movement of electricity through a connected network and has been applied across a variety of fields [36].
5,the circuit is simply a network of nodes connected by resistors.
5,"in our case, the nodes are locations of human activity and the resistors are the road network."
5,"when voltage is applied across a resistor (i.e., road) connecting two nodes (i.e., activity locations), the amount of current that flows between the two nodes is a function of the voltage applied, the resistance between the two nodes and the configuration of resistors between them."
5,we used an open source software called ‘circuitscape’ to apply circuit theory using spatial raster grids [37].
5,"specifically, we used circuitscape version 4.0, programmed in julia [38], which enabled processing at 5 m spatial resolution [39]."
5,"for a more detailed description of how circuit theory is applied to spatial raster grids, we refer readers to [36,37]."
5,"for each of the three types of activity, we iteratively applied voltage between each activity source and each of the activity locations (i.e., nodes; figure 2)."
5,"for general activities derived from social media posts, we defined sources as any post with an intensity >10th percentile that also overlaid nighttime lights visible in satellite imagery captured by the defense meteorological satellite program/operational linescan system (dmsp/ols) (figure 2a and supplementary materials: figure s1e)."

7,image-based classification 2.4.1.
7,"app-based road data we collected data on road surface conditions and travel speed for a subset of the study area using a free mobile app called roadlab-pro, originally developed by the world bank (see progressana.com accessed on 28 june 2021)."
7,"when activated, the app uses the gps receiver in a mobile device to automatically track location and travel speed and uses the device’s accelerometer to estimate road surface roughness."
7,"six different users working for industrial and non-profit organizations operating in the region agreed to collect data for this project during daily work routines between june 2018 and march 2019 (e.g., checking oil and gas well sites, conducting wildlife surveys, etc.)."
7,"data coverage totalled approximately 1000 km of roads and 771 unique road segments, which we used as training data for the image-based classification."
7,2.4.2.
7,"satellite data for use in the image-based classification, we obtained orthorectified (level 3a) rapid- eye satellite imagery acquired between 8 august and 17 september 2017."
7,"the rapideye constellation of commercial satellites produces moderately high-resolution images (5 m pixels) with the capability of frequent imaging (revisit time of 1.0–5.5 days) over large areas [40], which is a useful platform for road monitoring in rural areas [21]."
7,"rapideye im- agery provides five bands covering the visible blue (440–510 nm), green (520–590 nm) and red (630–685 nm) wavelengths, as well as a red-edge band (690–730 nm) and a near-infrared band (nir; 760–850 nm) that are each highly sensitive to green vegetation."
7,"we mosaicked the rapideye imagery into a single multi-band image, thus representing conditions during late summer 2017."
7,"from the multi-band rapideye imagery, we generated a suite of seven vegetation indices (table 1) related to vegetation cover and soil composition in forested environments [41,42], with the expectation that variation in vegetation and soil reflectance would be associated with road surface conditions and margins that, in turn, are associated with use intensity."
7,"for example, heavily used roads are required to be constructed with gravel and have wider margins cleared of tall vegetation."
7,lightly used or temporary roads are more likely to be unimproved tracks cut into the soil with narrower margins and vegetation regrowth on or along the road surface.
7,we also generated four terrain variables from a 30 m digital elevation model produced from the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) shuttle radar topography mission (srtm) (table 1).
7,"in addition to the simple terrain variables of elevation and slope, we included insolation (a measure of primary energy received from the sun accounting for variation in elevation and aspect; calculated in arcmap 10.6) and a topographic wetness index (a measure of near- and at-surface water accumulation) under the assumption that these represent patterns of snow melt and soil conditions which in turn influence where different types of road are constructed."
7,"for example, primary roads may be less likely to traverse a steep north slope which will hold snow and may become impassable in winter."
7,we calculated descriptive statistic metrics for the seven vegetation indices and four terrain variables for a 25 m buffer around each road segment using feature extraction 2.7 (fetex) software [43] (supplementary materials: table s2).
7,"the 25 m buffer was used to account for roads of differing widths, road margins, and spatial errors that may exist in the gps- derived road vector data and orthorectified satellite imagery."
7,"the fetex 2.7 software was developed to characterize and classify agricultural parcels, but is applicable to any vector overlay and provides a computationally efficient means to extract a variety of spatial metrics."
7,"in addition to the descriptive statistics from the vegetation indices and terrain variables, we also used fetex 2.7 to compute textural and semi-variogram metrics (supplementary materials: table s2) from the nir band, which is sensitive to green vegetation."
7,"within the fetex program, we set the parcel perimeter buffer to 2 pixels and did not specify a minimum parcel size."
7,"for the texture metrics extraction, we set the grey- level co-occurrence matrix (glcm) grey levels at 64 and for the semi-variogram metrics extraction we set the lag size to 20 pixels and the random pixels percentage to 15."

8,"semi-variogram metrics detail the spatial patterns of pixel values, and are useful when performing classification from high resolution imagery in forested landscapes [44,45]."
8,"we expected that these metrics would be helpful to distinguish wider roads with homogenous surfaces and margins (i.e., lower roughness, higher speeds) from narrower roads with variable surfaces that may be occluded by overstory vegetation (i.e., higher roughness, lower speeds)."

8,"classification method using training data collected from roadlab pro and the fetex metrics derived from rapideye imagery as predictors, we classified speed and roughness of road segments using supervised random forest classifications programmed with the caret package in r [46]."
8,"prior to modelling, continuous speed and roughness training data were grouped into three discrete classes (low, medium, and high) based on visual inspections of histograms of the distribution of each variable."
8,the three speed classes were separated at 40 and 65 kph (supplementary materials: figure s3) and the roughness classes at 2.2 and 3.4 (unitless index values; supple- mentary materials: figure s4).
8,predictions were made for all road segments longer than 250 m.
8,"for segments shorter than 250 m, we assigned the majority predicted value of the longest segment they adjoined."
8,"the final three-class road classification of low use, medium use and high use combined the speed and roughness classifications by first ranking each separate prediction from 1–3 (low to high), then summing the two rankings, and finally re-ranking the summed values as low use = 2–3, medium use = 4, and high use = 5–6."

9,"grizzly bears were captured and collared by biologists from the fri research grizzly bear program (hinton, alberta) as part of long-term research and to inform provincial recovery efforts."

9,all animal capture and handling followed the canadian council of animal care guidelines and were permitted annually through the university of saskatchewan animal care committee.
9,see [50] for detailed information about grizzly bear capture and handling.
9,we evaluated population level movements and habitat selection of grizzly bears relative to non-classified roads (“any road”) and roads classified using the three methods described above.
9,"more specifically, we compared how movement rate changed and habitat selection varied by time of day—nocturnally and diurnally—for each road class as a function of distance to road."
9,we predicted that grizzly bears would alter their behaviour when using areas within ~1000 m of high-use roads by increasing nocturnal activity due to some perceived risk attributed to human activity levels.
9,"if grizzly bears were responding to high-use roads in this manner, we expected movement rates would change and selection would be stronger at night [17]."
9,"for each bear-year, when 10 or more consecutive gps relocations were available, we calculated the movement rate (m/hr) and turning angle between each relocation (i.e., step) using the amt package in r [50]."
9,"to analyze changes in typical movement patterns near roads of different classes, we first modeled movement rate across all relocations using a generalized additive model (gam)."
9,"grizzly bear movement tended to follow a diurnal pattern, with reduced activity at night and increased movement during the day, especially in the morning and evening [51], and some variation between age-sex-reproductive classes (figure 3)."
9,"movement also tended to be greater when the turning angle between steps was low, i.e., when grizzly bears are moving more linearly (figure 3)."
9,"based on these observed trends, we modeled movement rate as a function of age-sex-reproductive class, hour of the day and turning angle."
9,we smoothed hour of the day using a cyclic cubic regression spline and included an interaction with age-sex-reproductive class.
9,we cosine-transformed turning angle and used a cubic regression spline for smoothing.
9,"once this model was created, we analyzed deviations from expected movement rates (i.e., model residuals) within 1000 km of unpaved roads in general (i.e., “any road’”), and for each class within each of the three road-use classifications approaches."
9,we were particularly interested in how deviations differed during the day and at night to determine if grizzly bears appeared to be more nocturnal around high-use roads.
9,we also analyzed habitat selection of grizzly bears at the level of the home range (third-order) by generating 100% minimum convex polygons (mcps) for each bear and year.
9,"because we were interested in grizzly bears’ response to unpaved roads, we clipped out areas of the home range where paved roads were closer than unpaved roads."
9,"we then created separate datasets for those gps locations that occurred during day-time hours, which included twilight, versus those that occurred during night based on sunrise, sunset, and civil twilight tables [52]."
9,"for each dataset and use location, we generated 10 random ‘available’ locations within each mcp and extracted the distance to the nearest road of each of the three classes and for each classification approach."
9,"we then transformed each distance variable using an exponential decay of the form 1-(e-αd ) where d was the distance in meters and α was set to either 0.02 (fine scale, within ~200 m) or 0.002 (large scale, within ~2000 m)."

14,discussion we found that the three road classification methods had moderate class agreement and showed similar broad spatial patterns of road use.
14,"despite some inconsistencies, all three methods improved grizzly bear habitat selection modelling compared to using unclassified roads."
14,"additionally, grizzly bears showed similar selection and behavioural responses across the three methods: greater selection near high use roads irrespective of time of day, but a stronger shift in movement rate near high use roads between daytime (lower) versus nighttime (higher) compared to low and medium use roads."
15,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 2547 15 of 21 4.1."
15,"road classification while the reference is not a true ground-truth, it is encouraging that the network- and image-based approaches based on remote observation showed at least some consistency with the reference classes—more than half of the nearly 14,000 km of unpaved roads in the study area were characterized into the same class across the three methods (table 3)."
15,"the government of alberta has devoted immense resources to produce and maintain a provincial database covering a wide range of road types, and there are few places in the world with such detailed information on unpaved rural and resource roads."
15,"however, even when such detailed road data are available, they may not be maintained at a frequency to permit analysis of temporal changes, which may be critical to habitat monitoring (e.g., [21])."
15,"for example, data inconsistencies can arise when data are collected at different time periods or in different jurisdictions."
15,"the network- and image-based approaches developed in this study show promise as cost-effective methods to characterize road use for wildlife conservation applications, although more work is needed to better understand their relative strengths and weaknesses."
15,the relatively consistent response of grizzly bears in our models using all three methods suggests that the road segments for which there was consistent classification agreement are influencing grizzly bear behaviour in this region and even imperfect characterization may be sufficient to improve wildlife modeling.
15,"within this study area, given the lack of traffic data associated with rural roads across the region, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether any of the classifications represent human road use better than the others."
15,"the fact that all three show some agreement and provide more information than treating all unpaved roads as equivalent (e.g., figure 5, table 4) suggests that each of the methods could be used or adapted to the data availability of a given application."
15,each classification approach comes with advantages and disadvantages.
15,"for example, the reference classification is a simple approach when existing road databases provide additional attribute information that can be used as a proxy for road use activity."
15,"this study suggests that, in this region, the reference classes are appropriate elements to include when building grizzly bear habitat models for management purposes, and future research in this region should explore how other species respond to the reference classes."
15,we encourage future studies to test classification systems available for other regions from public or open source datasets.
15,"when pre-existing road classes are not available, or data are found to be inadequate or outdated, the image-based approach is likely the most objective and easily replicable across regions since it relies on spectral information derived from satellites and ground data that can be collected using widely available technology."
15,"the fact that the spatial distribution of high-, medium-, and low-use roads predicted using this approach was similar to the other two approaches suggests that there is a relationship between spectral reflectance patterns of roads captured by satellite and broad patterns of human activity."
15,"the accuracy of predicting surface roughness and travel speed using moderately-high resolution rapideye imagery and the fetex-derived spectral variables was relatively low (table 2), although we note that accurate predictions of road roughness and travel speed were not primary objectives in this study."
15,"however, this shows that more work is needed to predict these individual road features."
15,"deep learning algorithms of higher spatial resolution imagery, both of which are becoming increasingly accessible, would likely improve results."
15,"currently, there are few examples of successful satellite-based monitoring of road conditions (e.g., [30]), and while this study shows promise, more work is needed to develop highly accurate predictions."
15,"the development of such predictions could enable cost-effective monitoring of changes in road use over time, as well as other applications for monitoring road conditions for the purpose of maintenance or emergency response plan- ning."
15,"our study suggests that capturing spatial spectral variability (e.g., fetex-derived semi-variogram metrics) may be particularly useful for characterizing unpaved roads with remotely sensed imagery at this spatial scale."
15,"it is important to note that classifications developed for one region may not be applicable to another region due to differences in road surface materials, as well as differences in the relationships between travel speed,"
16,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 2547 16 of 21 road roughness, spectral reflectance and human activity."
16,"furthermore, additional research is needed to better understand the conditions under which spatial spectral variability is related to road use and conditions."
16,"for example, the relationship may not hold in desert conditions where roadside vegetation is sparse or non-existent, or in urban conditions where roadsides are highly variable and managed for objectives unrelated to road use."
16,the network-based approach provides a framework from which to build innovative methods to translate the vast amount of spatially explicit human activity information shared on social media and available in other public and open databases into meaningful information to improve our understanding of human-environment interaction.
16,our ap- plication of circuitscape—an algorithm developed to predict habitat connectivity—is a novel approach to quantifying road network activity.
16,"the method is uniquely designed to capture pinch points in the road network and, when parametrized with data of known locations of human activity (i.e., social media data), may be especially useful for identifying high-use road segments."
16,"while social media databases represent a massive and rapidly growing source of infor- mation on the nature and intensity of human activity, such datasets are not without their lim- itations and potential biases."
16,"age, socio-economic condition and other geo-demographics likely influence patterns in social media use, which may differ across platforms [26,57,58]."
16,"people engaging in activities where location is sensitive (e.g., hunting, fishing) may be less likely to make geo-tagged posts, whereas photogenic events such as blooming flowers or wildlife sightings could lead to a disproportionate number of posts relative to visitors at specific locations [26]."
16,the latter may help explain why less of the road network was classified as low use with the network-based approach compared to the image-based and reference methods.
16,a biased under-classification of low-use roads may also explain the reversed pattern in relative habitat selection between low and medium use roads in the network-based approach compared to the other two methods.
16,different data sources will likely capture different activities.
16,"we sought to combine data from multiple social media platforms, along with satellite data and public records, in order to account for a wide range of activities."
16,"however, combining data through scaling and classification requires subjective decisions to be made about the relative contribution of each dataset to overall human activity and what level of activity is considered “high” or “low”."
16,grizzly bear response to roads our results suggest that incorporating road classification into habitat models provides additional information to explain grizzly bear response to roads compared to treating all roads as equal.
16,we observed different patterns of movement and habitat selection for roads with different predicted human activity levels.
16,"grizzly bears appear to be more active near high use roads at night, as indicated by greater movement rates (figure 5) and stronger selection (figure 6) for all classification approaches."
16,"indeed, a recent study of more than 2500 individuals showed that grizzly bears inhabiting human-dominated landscapes do not necessarily avoid areas with greater human activity, but rather shift toward more nocturnal behavioural patterns [59]."
16,"our results support this conclusion and suggest that the deviation from typical diel movement observed in figure 5 does not reflect avoidance of high use roads, but rather distinct behavioural patterns."
16,"for example, low movement rates during the day could be an indication of foraging behaviour, or more cautious movements near high use roads, and rapid movement at night may indicate that grizzly bears are using these as travel corridors during that time."
16,"the fact that the probability of selection is greatest near high use roads (figure 6 and supplementary materials: figure s7) suggests that foraging, rather than caution, may be driving the lower daytime movement rates observed near high use roads."
16,"this selection of high use roads contrasts with findings by [17] in southern alberta, where they found grizzly bears avoided roads with high traffic volumes (>100 vehicles per day) during the day."
16,it is possible that traffic volumes on roads classified as high use in our study are still lower than those in more populated
17,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 2547 17 of 21 southern alberta, or that the human activity datasets in our study do not fully capture traffic patterns."
17,"nonetheless, it is concerning that grizzly bears may be especially attracted to high use roads for foraging."
17,"studies in western alberta and eastern british columbia have shown that more than 85% of all human-caused grizzly bear mortalities occurred within about 100 m of a road (most were shot, not hit by vehicles) [5]."
17,"if high use roads are more strongly associated with grizzly bear space-use, this could increase the likelihood of negative human–bear interactions."
17,"it is possible that high use roads are more attractive to bears as a result of site selection, disturbance, or for both reasons."
17,"roads with greater traffic require wider road margins, resulting in more disturbance and more light penetration, both which can lead to enhanced production of grizzly bear foods [11]."
17,"roadkill of small mammals and ungulates, which can attract bears, may be more abundant along the high use roads in this study area."
17,"while these roads are expected to have the greatest travel speeds and traffic volumes of all unpaved roads in the area, speed and traffic are still moderate or low compared to highways and our study shows they do not elicit avoidance in grizzly bears."
17,"such roads with moderate traffic volume, but insufficient to elicit avoidance, are expected to have the largest number of ungulate and small mammal carcasses due to these animals behavioural response to roads [60]."
17,"larger and more frequently travelled roads may also be more likely to be constructed within already existing attractive habitat, for example in flatter terrain and along riparian corridors, which are preferred by grizzly bears [11,61]."
17,"by incorporating spatially explicit estimates of food resources (e.g., from satellite imagery and modeling) along with road classifications into analyses of grizzly bear movement, future studies may reveal whether thresholds of human activity and food resources at which grizzly bear behaviour changes exist."
17,"a better understanding of the timing and nature of potential co-occurrence of grizzly bears and people along roads would enhance the toolkit of land managers to set policies such as temporary and permanent road access closures [5], site selection and construction guidelines for new road development and public outreach and education."
17,analysis at finer temporal scales would likely yield a more nuanced understanding of human activity along road networks and their influence on wildlife behaviour.
17,"in this study, we used gps collar data for grizzly bear movements from 2014–2017, and sought to represent cumulative human activity for approximately this period (i.e., active oil and gas wells in 2016, forest logging from 2014–2016 and cumulative social media activity as of late 2017)."
17,"while our analysis of grizzly bear behaviour tested the assumption that human activity varied between daytime and nighttime, it is also expected that human activity would vary seasonally and year-to-year."
17,"all the datasets used in this study could be analyzed for separate years, while most of the social media datasets could also be analyzed sub-annually since they contain timestamps."
17,"analyzing oil and gas or logging activity at sub-annual temporal scales would be more challenging since data on the timing of activities that may drive more frequent traffic or large-truck traffic are not available, although separate analysis for each human activity by type may show different broad scale grizzly bear responses based on the type of traffic associated with each activity."
17,"such analysis was beyond the scope of this study, which had the primary objective of describing and comparing the newly developed road characterization methods."
17,"however, it is important to note that analysis at finer temporal scales and by type of human activity may reveal different patterns of human activity and grizzly bear behaviour in this study area."
17,conclusions this study demonstrated that remotely sensed and crowd-sourced datasets can be used to estimate human use of unpaved roads within critical wildlife habitat to better understand the behaviour of threatened wildlife and quantify impacts.
17,we found evidence of nocturnal behaviour by grizzly bears near high-use roads that was not evident when roads where unclassified.
17,"perhaps most importantly, for grizzly bears in this study area, including any of the three classifications examined for this research improved the fit of"
18,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 2547 18 of 21 movement and habitat selection models."
18,"this underscores the importance of characterizing road attributes related to indirect effects on wildlife (e.g., human activity), even for unpaved rural roads."
18,"when existing road databases include road attribute information (i.e., the reference in this study), this can be explored to develop proxies for the hypothesized indirect effects specific to a region."
18,"when such information is not available, the network- based and image-based classifications developed in this study provide examples of how emerging large datasets can be utilized for wildlife research and conservation where infrastructure development is widespread."
18,"supplementary materials: the following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/rs13132547/s1, table s1: number of data observations for each social media platform used to derive locations of recreation activity in the network-based classification; table s2: codes and description of the spectral, textural and semi-variogram based features produced by the fetex 2.7 software."

18,"figure s2: current flow outputs from the circuitscape algorithm along the road network for (a) recreation activity represented by social media posts, (b) oil and gas activity represented by active well sites and (c) recent forest logging activity detected by satellite."
18,higher current flow along a given road segment was interpreted as greater human activity.
18,"activity sources where travelers to activity locations are likely to have originated, and are thus the source nodes to which each activity location (i.e., destination node) was iteratively connected during the circuitscape runs for each respective activity type."
