2,introduction efficient use of agricultural water resources is becoming increasingly important for sustainable agricultural water management and global food production [1].
2,"evapotran- spiration (et), one of the major forms of water loss in agricultural landscapes, plays a crucial role in describing crop water use and soil moisture status [2]."
2,"accurate monitoring of et at field or sub-field scales can be used to identify crop stress and increase crop water use efficiency, thereby improving potential for crop production in water-limited regions."
2,"thermal remote sensing has become one of the most effective techniques for et mapping, complementing conventional point-based observational methods including eddy covariance, bowen ratio (br) and lysimeters [3]."
2,"field measurements of et are sparse and localized, and thus of limited use for operational applications, while et models developed on remote sensing data are more suited for mapping the spatial distribution of et at both field and regional scales [4–8]."
2,"over the past few decades, several thermal satellite-based approaches have been developed and widely applied, including the surface energy balance algorithm for land (sebal) [9], the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration (metric) [10], the operational simplified surface energy balance (ssebop) [11] and the atmosphere-land exchange inverse model (alexi) [12,13] and its associated flux disaggregation technique (disalexi) [14,15]."
2,these remote sensing approaches use land surface temperature (lst) retrieved from satellite thermal radiances along with other land surface characteristics such as surface albedo and leaf area index (lai) or other vegetation indices to estimate et via surface energy balance or within-scene scaling [15–18].
2,"the landsat imaging system, with sensors covering the spectrum from visible, near- infrared, shortwave infrared to tir (thermal infrared) and at spatial resolutions from 30–120 m, is a gold standard for field-scale et monitoring [10,19]."
2,"however, the relatively low revisit frequency of 16 days for a single landsat system or 8 days for two combined landsat systems (table 1) limits its applicability for routine generation of daily et esti- mates at field scales, with cloud cover further reducing the actual data availability [19–21]."
2,moderate-resolution sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) and the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (viirs) can provide valuable information about moisture dynamics at coarser scales (~500 m) on a near-daily basis.
2,"to generate spatially and temporally high-resolution et products, spatiotemporal im- age fusion techniques such as spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (starfm) [22] have been employed to produce 30 m daily et estimates from modis and landsat retrievals with mean absolute errors (mae) lower than 1 mm d−1 over a range of land cover types [23–27]."

2,"while data fusion provides a valuable means for temporal interpolation, the accuracy or the resulting daily 30 m timeseries is highly dependent on the frequency and quality of clear-sky landsat-scale et imagery."
2,"in addition, performance for real-time applications may be further limited by latencies in landsat product availability, and the need for extrapolation beyond the last available landsat overpass to the current date."
2,the fusion of et timeseries from landsat 8 and modis for operational applications was tested by [28].
3,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 3420 3 of 31 they found that the 16 day revisit interval of landsat 8, together with the 21.6 day latency, was not sufficient to effectively capture vegetation response to stress onset and suggested that the integration of data from multiple landsat-like sensor platforms and a reduction in data latency could be useful."
3,"as a test of multi-source et mapping capabilities, reference [29] incorporated thermal imaging from the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station (ecostress), with ~70 m spatial resolution and an average 4 day revisit cycle, into the et fusion system."
3,"since ecostress is a thermal-only sensor, vswir (visible to shortwave infrared bands) data from the closest landsat overpass date were used to supply albedo and lai inputs to the et modeling system."
3,"in comparison with flux tower observations, they demonstrated that fusion of the combined dataset of ecostress and landsat (labeled as landsat + ecostress fusion) showed improved performance over landsat-only fusion, particularly over sites impacted by frequent cloud cover."
3,"while ecostress tir and landsat vswir inputs could in most cases be successfully combined within the energy balance model, landsat et retrievals were superior due to better inter- band registration."
3,"furthermore, significant temporal separation between landsat vswir and ecostress tir acquisitions can lead to discrepancies between lst and lai/albedo inputs and impose a source of error in the retrieved et [29]."
3,"the sentinel-2 (s2) satellite series (a and b), initially launched in 2015, provides surface reflectance (sr) data at 10–20 m spatial resolution with a 5 day combined repeat frequency (table 1)."
3,"given the similarity with landsat spectral bands and spatial scale, there has been a strong emphasis put on exploiting these data in combination to enhance temporal sampling."
3,"nasa’s harmonized landsat and sentinel-2 (hls) dataset provides a unified collection of sr data acquired by landsat 8 and s2 [30], with a combined effective revisit of 3–4 days."
3,"the high temporal resolution of hls makes it attractive for et mapping at field scales; however, s2 does not collect the tir data required for surface energy balance."
3,"some studies have used s2 sr data to sharpen sentinel-3 (s3, launched 2016) 1 km resolution tir images for modeling daily et [31]."
3,"however, viirs (see table 1), the follow-on instrument to modis, includes an i5 tir band at 375 m that is closer in resolution to s2 and has been collecting tir data with near-daily temporal frequency since 2013 [32,33]."
3,"reference [34] demonstrated that s2 sr data from the hls-s30 product could be effectively used to sharpen viirs tir data to 30 m resolution, facilitating viirs and s2 combined 30 m et retrieval."
3,selecting viirs data on s2 overpass days relieves the issue of temporal separation encountered using landsat vswir and ecostress tir data [29].
3,"given these considerations, in this study we aim to evaluate the value of adding viirs and s2 data to the existing landsat-only et fusion framework."
3,we first compare the viirs and s2 combined 30 m et retrievals (labeled as viirs-s2 et) with landsat retrievals for consistency both spatially and temporally.
3,"cases with poor viirs-based et retrievals are investigated, specifically focusing on the impact of view angles (range of ±~70◦ ; table 1) and cloud masks on viirs lst."
3,both landsat 30 m et retrievals only (landsat-only fusion) and landsat and viirs-s2 et retrievals together (labeled as landsat + viirs-s2 fusion) are fused with modis 500 m daily et estimates to generate two 30 m daily et datacubes.
3,the added value of additional viirs-s2 temporal sampling for both retrospective and real-time et mapping applications is evaluated using flux measurements from 11 tower sites across a range of crop types in the u.s.
3,"furthermore, we assess the capability of each data stream, alone and in combination, in establishing the temporal behavior of et during periods of rapid change (e.g., rainfall events, flash drought, green-up, and senescence)."
3,methods the multi-scale alexi and disalexi energy balance modeling system was used to generate consistent et layers from multi-source thermal and sr inputs.

4,"corn belt were also mapped: the mead domain (nebraska) in the platte river—high plains (prhp), and the bondville domain (illinois) in the central mississippi river basin (cmrb) region."
4,"these sites are mainly occupied by corn and soybean fields [41,54,59] with continuous monitoring by several long-term ameriflux installations: usne1 (mead) and usne2 (mead) in irrigated fields, and usne3 (mead) and usbo1 (bondville) in rainfed fields [60–63]."
4,"the choptank domain (maryland) and the barc (beltsville agricultural research center) domain (maryland) cover parts of the lower chesapeake bay (lcb) ltar net- work—located in the u.s. eastern shore, mainly occupied by a cropping system with irri- gated and rainfed corn-soybean rotation [25,64]."
4,the flux data used here were collected from the optimizing production inputs for economic and environmental enhancement (ope3) tower in the barc domain and the choptank tower [65–67].
4,"for comparison with modeled daily fluxes, which assume a closed energy budget, the observed tower fluxes were corrected for energy balance closure error, typically on the order of 10–30% for eddy covariance data [5]."
4,"typical closure corrections include the residual method, assigning the energy balance residual to the observed latent heat flux, or the bowen ratio method where the residual is partitioned between the latent and sen- sible heat fluxes based on the observed bowen ratio [5,68–71]."
4,"as suggested by [29], the corrected latent heat flux for the slm001 site was calculated by daytime residual plus the difference between daily (24 h) and daytime-observed latent heat flux since a shift in nighttime wind patterns was found, while the daily latent heat flux for the other tower figure sites was schematic diagram 1."

4,data mining sharpener (dms) the spatial resolution of land surface temperature (lst) data retrieved from thermal infrared (tir) satellite sensors is typically coarser than that of the surface reflectance data collected in vswir bands on the same platform.
4,"for instance, the resolution of landsat 8 and modis vswir bands are 30 m and 250–500 m, while the nominal resolution of tir sensors in these systems are 100 m and 1 km, respectively (table 1)."
4,"for physically based energy balance models such as alexi/disalexi, it is critical that lst, albedo and lai inputs are at a consistent spatial resolution."
4,"rather than degrading the vswir inputs to tir resolution, a thermal band imagery sharpening technique known as the data mining sharpener (dms) approach [35] has been used to sharpen both landsat and modis lst data to the resolution of their corresponding vswir bands."
4,the dms approach employs the cubist regression tree method to build non-linear relationships between sr and lst at lst coarse resolution and then uses these relationships to predict lst at finer sr reso- lution using sr data as inputs.

5,data mining sharpener (dms) the spatial resolution of land surface temperature (lst) data retrieved from thermal infrared (tir) satellite sensors is typically coarser than that of the surface reflectance data collected in vswir bands on the same platform.
5,"for instance, the resolution of landsat 8 and modis vswir bands are 30 m and 250–500 m, while the nominal resolution of tir sensors in these systems are 100 m and 1 km, respectively (table 1)."
5,"for physically based energy balance models such as alexi/disalexi, it is critical that lst, albedo and lai inputs are at a consistent spatial resolution."
5,"rather than degrading the vswir inputs to tir resolution, a thermal band imagery sharpening technique known as the data mining sharpener (dms) approach [35] has been used to sharpen both landsat and modis lst data to the resolution of their corresponding vswir bands."
5,the dms approach employs the cubist regression tree method to build non-linear relationships between sr and lst at lst coarse resolution and then uses these relationships to predict lst at finer sr resolution using sr data as inputs.
5,"the final critical step of the sharpening process, referred to as energy conservation (ec), is to redistribute the residuals between the original and predicted lst at the coarse resolution to the sharpened lst to ensure that it reaggregates to the original lst field at some spatial scale."
5,"for landsat 8 and modis tir sharpening, the ec size scale used in dms is 90 m and 1000 m, respectively."
5,"here, we use s2 sr data to sharpen viirs lst, collected on different platforms with different geolocation accuracies."
5,a modified dms approach [34] was proposed to account for the misregistration between sr and lst data collected from different platforms by relaxing the ec size.
5,"based on that study, we use an ec size of 780 m for viirs lst sharpening to 30 m based on s2 sr from the hls dataset."
5,"one benefit of thermal sharpening is that it improves spatial consistency between lst and albedo/lai inputs to the tseb, especially when these inputs are derived from sensors on different platforms that may suffer from some degree of misregistration."
5,"for further discussion of constraints and performance of the dms approach as applied to viirs and s2 imagery, we refer the reader to [34]."
5,"multiscale et retrieval system the multi-scale et mapping approach used here includes the atmosphere—land exchange inverse (alexi) surface energy balance model [12,13] and the associated disag- gregation algorithm disalexi [14,15]."
5,"both are based on the two-source energy balance (tseb) land-surface representation [36–39] which partitions surface fluxes and radiometric surface temperature into soil and canopy components: trad 4 (θ ) = f c (θ ) · tc4 + [1 − f c (θ )] · ts4 , (1) where trad is the directional radiometric temperature, tc is the canopy temperature and ts is the soil temperature, while f c (θ ) is the fractional vegetation cover apparent at the view zenith angle θ of the thermal sensor, estimated from retrievals of leaf area index (lai)."
5,"the component surface temperatures constrain the net radiation and sensible heat, while the latent heat is estimated as a partial residual to the energy budget, but responds to signals of canopy stress conveyed by the surface temperature inputs."
5,"over the u.s., alexi uses two measurements of morning lst (4 km resolution) obtained from the geostationary operational environmental satellites (goes) and applies the tseb in a time-differential mode to simulate fluxes and atmospheric boundary layer growth over the morning period [12,13]."
5,"daily et (mm day−1 ) is estimated by upscaling the instantaneous latent flux retrieved at the time of the second lst measurement to a daily value (mj m−2 day−1 ) by conserving the ratio of latent heat to insolation during daylight hours [40,41], and then converting to mass flux using the latent heat of vaporization (2.45 mj kg−1 )."
5,"to map et at finer scales, the disalexi algorithm was developed to spatially disaggregate daily alexi fluxes [14,15]."
5,"the disalexi scheme runs tseb at subpixel scales over each alexi pixel using higher-resolution lst and vegetation cover fraction inputs from polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., landsat or modis)."
5,the daily surface fluxes from disalexi are forced to reaggregate to the alexi value at the alexi pixel
6,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 3420 6 of 31 scale by iteratively adjusting air temperature at a nominal blending height (e.g., 50 m)."
6,this constraint to match the alexi daily et flux at coarse resolution provides a baseline for consistency between disaggregated retrievals from different sensors acquiring thermal data at different times of day.
6,"further information on the alexi/disalexi multiscale et modeling scheme can be found in [13,19,42,43]."
6,"multi-source et fusion system to provide field-scale et estimates on a daily basis requires a means for interpolating between retrievals on satellite overpass dates [9,44–46]."
6,"linear and cubic spline interpola- tion are often implemented using a scaling flux such as solar radiation, available energy, or reference et [10,20]."
6,"spatial-temporal fusion of remote sensing images is another approach, combining the high spatial information from sensors such as landsat and high temporal information from sensors such as modis to generate data with high content in both time and space."
6,"the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (starfm) [22,47] has shown its capability in fusing higher-order satellite products such as vegetation in- dex [48–50] and et [23–26,51]."
6,"a number of recent studies have demonstrated that fusing landsat- and modis-disalexi et retrievals using starfm improves performance in comparison with landsat-only interpolation over various land cover types [23–25,51], taking advantage of the high-frequency temporal changes sampled from modis, and the consistency between landsat and modis et is achieved by using alexi et as a common normalization field in disalexi."
6,"in starfm, a weighting function used to describe the spatial, temporal and spectral relationship is employed to downscale modis images to the landsat scale on prediction dates between landsat overpasses with the help of one or two landsat and modis image-pairs before or after the prediction date."
6,starfm is developed with the flexibility to use one or two image-pairs as inputs for the fusion.
6,two-pair starfm uses information from the image-pairs bracketing the prediction date.
6,"in general, two-pair starfm is more robust than one-pair but has higher requirements on data frequency."
6,"most previous et studies used one-pair starfm [25,29,41,52] because it was a simpler configuration and works better for near- real-time predictions when a second (future) image-pair is not yet available."
6,"however, a recent study by [53] fused landsat and modis et retrievals with both one-pair and two-pair starfm and found that two-pair starfm generally produces smaller bias com- paring with flux tower-observed daily et, but the degree of improvement depends on the frequency of fine resolution images that can be used as image-pairs."
6,"one-pair starfm can cause sharp drops/rises in the fused daily et timeseries over land-covers with rapidly changing conditions, while two-pair starfm shows improved performance in this aspect."
6,"here, we compare starfm performance using one-pair and two-pair fusion, but with additional viirs-s2 samples included."
6,"we obtained similar results to [53], with details given in the appendix a for interested readers."
6,"in this study, both the 30 m landsat-only et retrievals and landsat + viirs-s2 et retrievals are fused with 500 m modis et time series based on two-pair starfm to generate et datacubes at sub-field scales (30 m) and daily timesteps."
6,the two datacubes are compared with flux tower observations to evaluate the value added by the additional temporal sampling from viirs-s2.
6,"more details regarding the multi-source et fusion system can be found in previous work [24,25,51,54]."
6,study area and datasets 3.1.
6,"study domain and flux tower sites following the landsat + ecostress fusion study of [29], the alexi/disalexi et modeling system was applied to landsat + viirs-s2 for the year 2018 over seven study areas across the u.s., sampling a variety of climate conditions, cloud cover percentages and crop types (figure 2)."
6,the area of each domain is around 90 km × 90 km.
6,the accuracy of the modeled energy balance fluxes was evaluated at eleven flux towers distributed in
7,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 3420 7 of 31 the seven domains."
7,each tower was equipped with an eddy covariance system collecting energy fluxes and other micrometeorological data.
7,"most towers are part of the usda-ars long-term agroecosystem research (ltar) network, offering a rich archive of biophysical and micrometeorological ground truth data [55]."
7,"these sites include three vineyard domains within california, usa, part of the usda- ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment (grapex) [56], including the barrelli vineyard in sonoma county near cloverdale, sierra loma near lodi in sacramento county, and ripperdan in madera county near fresno."
7,"the domains sample a north-south climate gradient due to variations in cloud cover, temperature, and humidity [24,26,28,57,58]."
7,"this study uses three flux towers installed in irrigated vineyards in the three domains as part of grapex: bar012 (barrelli), slm001 (sierra loma), and rip760 (ripperdan)."
7,"in addition, two ameriflux towers located in the california delta region, in the western part of sierra loma domain, were also used."
7,"these towers, usbi1 and usbi2, sampled fields cultivated in 2018 with irrigated alfalfa and corn, respectively [29]."
7,two cropland sites across the midwest within the u.s.
7,"corn belt were also mapped: the mead domain (nebraska) in the platte river—high plains (prhp), and the bondville domain (illinois) in the central mississippi river basin (cmrb) region."
7,"these sites are mainly occupied by corn and soybean fields [41,54,59] with continuous monitoring by several long-term ameriflux installations: usne1 (mead) and usne2 (mead) in irrigated fields, and usne3 (mead) and usbo1 (bondville) in rainfed fields [60–63]."

7,the flux data used here were collected from the optimizing production inputs for economic and environmental enhancement (ope3) tower in the barc domain and the choptank tower [65–67].
7,"for comparison with modeled daily fluxes, which assume a closed energy budget, the observed tower fluxes were corrected for energy balance closure error, typically on the order of 10–30% for eddy covariance data [5]."
7,"typical closure corrections include the residual method, assigning the energy balance residual to the observed latent heat flux, or the bowen ratio method where the residual is partitioned between the latent and sensible heat fluxes based on the observed bowen ratio [5,68–71]."
7,"as suggested by [29], the corrected latent heat flux for the slm001 site was calculated by daytime residual plus the difference between daily (24 h) and daytime-observed latent heat flux since a shift in nighttime wind patterns was found, while the daily latent heat flux for the other tower sites was computed as the 24 h residual."

7,"in addition, alexi/disalexi also requires landcover classification information to specify surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties."
7,global land cover dataset at 1 km resolution from university of maryland (umd) was used in alexi [73].
7,"the 2006 30 m national land cover dataset (nlcd) [74,75] was employed for disalexi running at 30 m resolution using landsat and viirs-s2 data as inputs, and resampled to 1 km resolution assigned by the majority class within each modis pixel for modis disaggregation using disalexi."

8,"near-daily modis et retrievals at 500 m resolution were generated with disalexi by disaggregating the alexi et estimates (i.e., disalexi-modis et) using data from several modis standard products including lst (mod11_l2), ndvi (mod13a1), lai (mcd15a3h) and albedo (mcd43a3)."
8,temporal gaps in the disalexi-modis et retrievals due to clouds or swath limitations were filled using methods described by [25].
8,more details about the alexi-goes and disalexi-modis processing can be found in [51].

8,"disalexi-landsat for landsat disaggregation, the 30 m lai inputs on landsat overpass dates were retrieved from landsat 7 and 8 vswir data and modis 500 m lai samples using a regression tree approach developed by [76]."
8,albedo at 30 m resolution was calculated based on the narrowband to broadband conversion formulae for landsat developed in [77].
8,landsat level-1 thermal band top-of-atmosphere temperatures were downloaded from usgs and atmospherically corrected using modtran [78].
8,the resulting lst data at the native resolution of 100 m were sharpened to the 30 m resolution of the vswir bands using the dms method described in section 2.1 [35].
8,3.2.4.
8,"disalexi-viirs remote sensing data from landsat 7 and 8, s2a and s2b, and viirs were used to run disalexi at 30 m spatial resolution on landsat and sentinel-2 overpass days."
8,the landsat collection 1 level-2 surface reflectance was downloaded from usgs.
8,"the s2 data were produced by the nasa’s hls project (http://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/, last accessed on 10 october 2020)."
8,the hls dataset provides a unified collection of sr data acquired by landsat 8 and s2.
8,"the s30 product was used in this study, providing s2 sr data that have been calibrated, atmospherically corrected, brdf normalized, co-registered with landsat 8, and resampled to 30 m spatial resolution [30]."
8,the hls production system uses the s2 gridding scheme with a fixed tile extent; study domains covering more than one tile were mosaicked.
8,"hls data (v1.4) also provide cloud masks (qa band), in which the s2 (s30) mask is a union of a mask derived from the lasrc atmospheric correction tool [79] and a mask generated from the fmask algorithm [80]."
8,it is reported that lasrc cloud mask often confuses clouds with bright urban areas.
8,"in addition, while fmask works well for landsat, this does not guarantee similar performance with s2 and may generate erroneous results, particularly for hazy conditions, thin clouds, cloud edges, and bright urban and snow areas due to the lack of thermal infrared bands [30]."
8,"this concern regarding cloud detections, reported as one of the main issues in the nasa’s harmonized product, was also found to be significant in this study (see section 4.3.3.2 for details)."
8,vswir inputs from s2 (s30) were used for disalexi-viirs disaggregation on the common overpass dates between s2 and viirs.
8,"s2 30 m lai data were estimated in a similar way to landsat, using modis lai samples."
8,the surface reflectance from vswir bands in the hls s30 dataset has been spectrally adjusted to match l30 spectral response (oli) using a band-to-band linear regression approach [30].
8,"therefore, the s2 albedo data was computed similarly to landsat [81] using the narrow-to-broadband equation proposed by [77]."
8,viirs i5 at-sensor brightness temperature observations resampled to a 0.004 degree resolution were downloaded from nasa lance and atmospherically corrected using a single channel inversion [82] based on atmospheric profiles of temperature and moisture from the cfsr v2 [72].
8,"using s2 vswir data as inputs, geometrically calibrated viirs lst data were gridded to the same utm projection and sharpened to 30 m using the modified dms approach with an ec box size of 780 m as described in section 2.1 [34]."
8,"the cloud mask used for viirs is associated with the fire product (375 m i-band), and the impact of this mask was also evaluated in this study (see section 4.3.3.1)."
8,it should be noted that the cloud contamination in the s2 vswir data and viirs lst can be different since their
9,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 3420 9 of 31 acquisition times are different."
9,"thus, the cloud issues in the viirs et retrievals are a union of cloud contaminated pixels from both the s2 vswir data and the viirs lst."
9,the viirs scanning radiometer has a field-of-view ±56.28◦ in the cross-track direction to provide a full daily coverage of the earth.
9,"in order to restrict the growth of pixel size at off-nadir view, viirs employed a unique sample aggregation scheme, so that the viirs i-band pixels at the edge of scan (0.83 × 0.86 km) are only 2–4 times the size of nadir pixels (0.38 × 0.39 km), in contrast to modis exhibiting a growth factor of 10 [83,84]."
9,"three ag- gregation zones were defined based on the segmentation of scan angle: “3 × 1 aggregation (from nadir to ±31.72◦ ),” “2 × 1 aggregation (from 31.72◦ to 44.86◦ ),” and “no aggrega- tion (also called 1 × 1 aggregation; from 44.86◦ to 56.28◦ )” zones, that is, three samples, two samples, and one sample are aggregated along the scan direction to form one single pixel, respectively [85,86]."
9,"by employing such a scheme, viirs shows a stepwise resolution degradation as a function of view angle [32,87]."
9,it should be noted that the difference in acquisition times between s2 vswir and viirs lst data (table 1) may also introduce inconsistencies due to changes in view angle and topographic shadowing and impact the performance of viirs lst sharpening and et retrievals.
9,the effect of view angle on the accuracy of et retrievals was assessed in this study (see section 4.3.2).
9,"analyses performance of the new disalexi-viirs et retrievals was evaluated on satellite over- pass dates in comparison with disalexi-landsat (section 4.1) which has been successfully applied in several studies over varied landcover [25,41,51,58,88]."
9,"this comparison was performed (1) on landsat overpass dates, using landsat (l30) vswir to sharpen viirs lst (sierra loma domain, section 4.1.1), and (2) on common landsat and s2 overpass dates using s2 vswir data for viirs sharpening (all domains, section 4.1.2)."
9,"et retrievals from (1) and (2) are referred to as viirs-landsat and viirs-s2 et, respectively."
9,performance of the fused timeseries was also evaluated with respect to flux tower observations (section 4.2).
9,daily et datacubes were constructed by fusing modis 500 m daily et time series with (1) landsat 30 m et only (landsat-only) and (2) landsat and viirs-s2 et together (landsat + viirs-s2).
9,for each domain we compared the two et datacubes with flux tower observations to quantitatively assess the value added by viirs- s2 in improving estimates of daily et and the ability to capture rapid changes.
9,"we further investigated factors that may influence the value, including fusion strategy, temporal sampling (revisit interval), view angle, and cloud masking."
9,"for comparison with tower observations, model fluxes were averaged over a 3 × 3 pixel-area (90 × 90 m) centered on the tower location, approximating the flux source area footprint on the order of 100 m depending on tower height and surface conditions [5,89]."
9,"for sites where the towers lay at field edges, the center of extraction was moved a few pixels in-field to avoid edge effects."
9,"in previous studies, the et fusion methods have typically been conducted in a ret- rospective manner, which means for each target date, all direct et retrievals (up to and beyond the date) are available as inputs."
9,"in real-time applications, this will not be the case and value added by additional et samples may be larger than in the retrospective case in that the interval of extrapolation from the last available sample and the prediction date is reduced."
9,"we tested this scenario, focusing on weekly et estimation for irrigation management, following conventions developed for a variable rate drip irrigation (vrdi) system by [28]."
9,"in that study, weekly et was defined as a summation of daily et from the prior friday to thursday for delivery friday morning for the next week’s irrigation scheduling."
9,"here, pseudo real-time test runs were conducted using only direct 30 m et retrievals available prior to friday to predict the daily et for that week based on one- pair starfm and generate the weekly et total."
9,et for all days in the week beyond the last available satellite overpass date were projected forward by starfm.
9,"for simplicity, the data latency issue was not addressed here, so the fusion results represent the upper bound of the operational test."
9,"it should be noted that the temporal differences between landsat-only and landsat + viirs-s2 fusion should become more pronounced (i.e., more"

21,"examination of model output showing discrepant et estimates, both in comparison with tower fluxes and landsat retrievals, identified several scenes with obvious cloud contaminations in the lst inputs that were not captured in the fire product cloud mask."
21,an additional cloud screening technique was developed by calculating a pixel-based baseline climatology based on the entire viirs lst data from year 2013 to 2019.
21,"then, an anomaly is calculated for each pixel, and the pixel is assumed to be cloud contaminated when the anomaly is less than −2.5 standard deviations."
21,this screening is applied with the current cloud mask.
21,"the new cloud screening method (named as new mask hereafter) was more effective in flagging cloud-impacted et retrievals, which tend to be biased high with respect to landsat retrievals and et measurements."

24,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 3420 24 of 31 to provide guidance for effective strategies for viirs-s2 usage, we further discussed several potential limits in applying viirs lst and s2 sr data as inputs for sub-field et mapping."
24,"unflagged clouds in both viirs and s2 bands due to faulty cloud masking, as shown in section 4.3.3 (e.g., doy 166 at usbo1/choptank site), can result in large retrieval errors and thus limit the practical utility of et estimates."
24,"the overpass times for viirs and s2 are different, so cloud cover at either acquisition time will affect the image coverage, increasing limitations in the data availability."
24,the viirs cloud mask associated with the fire product (i-bands) was improved in this study by applying a baseline climatology-based threshold.
24,future studies may take advantage of the cloud mask associated with m-bands to help flag anomalous pixels.
24,"as reported by [30] and discussed in section 4.3.3.2, the fmask used in s2 product of hls v1.4 may generate erroneous results particularly for hazy conditions, thin clouds and cloud edges since there are no thermal bands."
24,"the hls v1.5 version employing fmask 4.2, an update of fmask 4.0 [97] has been released since late 2020, as reported by nasa [98]."
24,future studies will update to the new hls version.
24,decreased accuracy of et retrievals using ecostress lst at high view angles was found to be associated with spatial resolution degradation and misregistration errors in the sharpening process [29].
24,"the spatial resolution of viirs degrades with view angle in a stepwise manner, also impacting the accuracy of retrieved et."
24,"we also found viirs lst data retrieved at high off-nadir view angles (e.g., >52◦ ) in some cases were systematically lower than same-day landsat retrievals, resulting in anomalously high et estimates."
24,"directional effects may have a significant influence on the measured lst with a large field of view [93,99]."
24,"angular variations of lst may have several causes [92,95,100]."
24,"one is related to the angular anisotropy of surface emissivity associated with different components of the land covers and water status (e.g., soil moisture)."
24,"in addition, the structured (3d) surface (e.g., canopy) can have a significant impact on the directional effects of lst through the geometry (e.g., sunlit and shaded elements within the canopy) and viewing more vegetation and less soil than from near nadir [101]."
24,canopy structural impacts on directional temperature are nominally accommodated in the tseb model structure via equation (1).
24,topography that leads to shadow changes with varying solar and viewing directions can also contribute to angular effects.
24,"finally, nonlinear effects of the longer atmospheric path lengths at higher view angles in the radiative transfer process can be another important factor [94]."
24,"the simplified single-channel atmospheric compensation method used here does not account for angular path differences, and is a likely source of bias at high view angles."
24,"to reduce uncertainties in et estimations, viirs lst at high sensor view angles should be used with caution."
24,the value added by the viirs-s2 et data layers as a supplement to landsat was found to be site- and application-specific.
24,"the improvement to et timeseries was found to be most significant at the usbi1 alfalfa site where et exhibits multiple seasonal peaks due to monthly cutting, and at the ope3 site where landsat data availability in the growing season is limited due to frequent cloud cover."
24,"the improvement in timeseries developed in retrospective mode was not significant for a few sites (e.g., rip760) which had a relatively small mean pair-prediction temporal offset (~5 days) over the peak growing season in the landsat-only case."
24,"this finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting that 5 days or lower revisit frequency is necessary for daily et mapping with reasonable accuracy [20,21]."
24,"however, an experiment simulating real-time et estimate generation further highlighted the added value afforded by viirs-s2 for operational applications, and will become more pronounced considering the latency in data delivery [28]."
24,a reduction in data latency and integration of data from multi-satellite platforms provide useful ways to reduce et errors in operational settings for crop irrigation management.
24,"in general, sharpening of viirs i5 tir band data appears to be an effective and feasible means for supplementing the hls dataset with thermal data on s2 overpass dates prior to the anticipated launch of the landsat surface temperature monitoring (lstm) mission (sentinel 8) by the european space agency."
24,"replacement of landsat 7 by landsat 9, scheduled for launch in september 2021, will further improve hls utility, providing an"
25,"remote sens. 2021, 13, 3420 25 of 31 additional source of single-platform sampling unencumbered by the scan-line corrector gaps associated with landsat 7."
25,"the ecostress mission has been extended to 2023, collecting thermal data with a nearly 4 day revisit and ~70 m spatial resolution [29]."
25,"in combination, these multiple landsat and landsat-like et data sources will improve our capability to capture rapidly changing et dynamics (e.g., flash drought) at sub-field scales."
25,"conclusions in this study, we evaluated the value for field-scale et retrieval added by augmenting the hls dataset using viirs lst sharpened with sentinel-2 sr data as a 30 m thermal proxy source on sentinel-2 overpass dates."
25,values were assessed in improving landsat-only 30 m daily et mapping based on the alexi + disalexi model across a range of crop types in the continental us through validation against landsat et baseline and in-site measurements from eleven flux tower sites.
25,"daily et maps from landsat and viirs-s2 on the common dates showed similar spatial patterns, regardless of the slightly lower spatial contrast and fewer details observed in viirs-s2 et."
25,evaluation with flux tower measurements shows comparable accuracy between landsat and viirs-s2 et estimates directly retrieved on the common overpass dates.
25,"for all eleven sites combined, the improvement of fused daily et timeseries from the fusion of landsat + viirs-s2 over the landsat-only case is not very significant (3% for daily and 6% for weekly in terms of rmse)."
25,"however, large improvement was observed at several individual sites where the temporal trend of et showed large variation (e.g., 18% in usbi1 site) or clear-sky landsat data were not available during periods of rapid changes (e.g., 16% in ope3 site)."
25,the fusion error tends to decrease with respect to an increased temporal sampling of et retrievals for fusion.
25,"the accuracy of fused et in the peak growing season shows a large drop when the offset between input and target dates reaches close to a month, highlighting the value of increased sampling provided by viirs-s2 in capturing the large temporal variability of et associated with rapid phenology change."
25,"for real-time et estimates, the improvement by landsat + viirs-s2 fusion can be more pronounced (27% in terms of r2) than the retrospective simulation (17%) with improved temporal sampling, highlighting the potential of landsat + viirs-s2 fusion in operational applications."
25,"the temporal dynamics of weekly et were better captured with extra viirs samples included (e.g., doy 260 at usbi1 site)."
25,"the accuracy of viirs-s2 et retrievals decreased with increasing view angles but in a stepwise manner, resembling the change in spatial resolution degradation of viirs lst."
25,"in addition, we found cases with large underestimation of viirs lst (as large as 6 k) at view angles of approximately 52◦ , leading to anomalously high et retrievals, likely related to spatial resolution degradation and misregistration errors in the sharpening process, angular effects in atmospheric correction, and directional temperature variations over partially vegetated surfaces."
25,these results highlight the need of a careful screening before using viirs-s2 et estimated at high view angles for fusion.
25,"we also found cases demonstrating the imperfection of cloud masks from both viirs and s2 in detecting clouds, leading to large errors in retrieved et."
25,a new cloud screening technique for viirs developed based on the baseline climatology shows improved performance in this study.
