1,bekaert research impact statement: interferometric synthetic aperture radar was shown to be a cost-effective means for monitoring large-scale land subsidence and localized subsidence affecting critical water infrastructure.
1,abstract: land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction in california’s san joaquin valley has been occurring for many decades.
1,in situ monitoring of subsidence in this large geographic area has historically been limited.
1,the california department of water resources (cdwr) sought the national aeronautics and space administration’s assistance for satellite- and aircraft-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (insar) monitoring of subsidence during the 2012–2016 drought.
1,insar was successful in cost-effectively providing first- ever synoptic measurement of land subsidence over the entire san joaquin valley.
1,the purpose of the monitor- ing was screening or hotspot detection of impact areas affecting critical water infrastructure.
1,"long-term cumula- tive land subsidence has substantially reduced the conveyance capacity of sections of major valley canals and the monitoring revealed that subsidence rates observed during the drought ranked with maximum historically observed rates, highlighting risks to water infrastructure."
1,insar also identified new and rapidly emerging hot- spots adjacent to critical water infrastructure.
1,the success of the insar monitoring for drought response resulted in cdwr’s decision to subsequently provide insar data as technical assistance to local agencies required to comply with recent state groundwater management legislation.
