1,previous studies have used data collected from either satellite or acoustic telemetry but rarely accepted 30 november 2014 both.
1,"in this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efﬁcacy of satellite available online 26 december 2014 and acoustic telemetry to deﬁne dugong movement patterns; compare the beneﬁts and limitations of each keywords: approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate acoustic telemetry data to the boundaries of a go slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike dugong dugon within an urbanised coastal embayment (moreton bay, queensland, australia)."
1,twenty-one dugongs were cap- gps tured in seagrass habitats on the eastern banks of moreton bay in july–september 2012 and july 2013 and ﬁtted marine wildlife with gps and acoustic transmitters.
1,both satellite and acoustic telemetry produced reliable presence and move- satellite ment data for individual dugongs.
1,"when the dugongs were within the range of the acoustic array, there was rel- telemetry atively good correspondence between the overall space use measures derived from gps and acoustic transmitters, demonstrating that acoustic tracking is a potentially valuable and cost-effective tool for monitoring local dugong habitat use in environments equipped with acoustic receiver arrays."
1,acoustic technology may be particularly useful for species that establish home ranges with stable residency especially near large urban or port environs.
1,"however, the relative merits of the two technologies depend on the research question in the con- text of the species of interest, the location of the study and whether the study site has an established acoustic array."
