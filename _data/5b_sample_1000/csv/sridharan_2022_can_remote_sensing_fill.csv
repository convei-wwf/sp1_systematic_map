1,"abstract: remote sensing has been heralded as the silver bullet in water quality modeling and watershed management, and yet a quantitative mapping of where its applicability is likely and most useful has not been undertaken so far."
1,"here, we combine geospatial models of cloud cover as a proxy for the likelihood of acquiring remote scenes and the shortest time of travel to population centers as a proxy for accessibility to ground-truth remote sensing data for water quality monitoring and produce maps of the potential of remote sensing in watershed management in the united states."
1,we generate several maps with different cost-payoff relationships to help stakeholders plan and incentivize remote sensing-based monitoring campaigns.
1,"additionally, we combine these remote sensing potential maps with spatial indices of population, water demand, ecosystem services, pollution risk, and monitoring coverage deficits to identify where remote sensing likely has the greatest role to play."
1,"we find that the southwestern united states and the central plains regions are generally suitable for remote sensing for watershed management even under the most stringent costing projections, but that the potential for using remote sensing can extend further north and east as constraints are relaxed."

3,"water 2022, 14, 1985 3 of 16 hyperspectral imagery [11], lidar and airborne laser scanning [12] can be used to infer crop characteristics and tree canopies in agrarian and forested watersheds."
3,"within water- sheds, indices developed by using reflectances from different spectral bands are useful for classifying land cover and land use types [13]."
3,"also within watersheds, the state of best management practices such as low impact developments and green infrastructure can be monitored using visible and thermal imagery and spectral reflectance-based indices [14]."
3,"authors have developed an array of methods ranging from the well-established to the experimental frontier have emerged to quantify watershed loading and receiving water quality pertaining to various types of impairment [15,16]."
3,"broadly, for land surface processes such as crop cycles, land cover and land use changes, observations of surface reflectances and ratios of reflectance across multiple spectral bands are used with validation datasets such as land use classification maps or photographs are common (e.g., [17])."
3,"for water quality parameters that affect the inherent and apparent optical properties of the water column and spectral properties of the reflectances, such as total suspended solids, chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic carbon, turbidity, and water surface temperature, statistical models linking observations of surface reflectances and ratios of reflectance across multiple spectral bands with the water quality parameters are popular [18]."
3,"for such processes, bio-optical and bio-geo-optical models that mechanistically link the irradiance- reflectance ratio across multiple spectral bands to the bulk water column properties are a reliable alternative [19]."
3,"for impairments such as harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion, more sophisticated statistical (e.g., [20]) or mechanistic models (e.g., [21]) are used to relate watershed nutrient loads with impairment."
3,"for water quality parameters that do not directly affect the optical properties of the water column and spectral properties of the reflectances (e.g., mercury and heavy metals), statistical, machine learning and artificial intelligence models relating the quantities of interest with other water constituents (e.g., turbidity) are becoming increasingly common [15]."
3,"two unifying requirements of all of these approaches are that for a given location, (i) it must be possible to obtain remotely sensed spectral imagery in the first place, and (ii) the land surface process such as fertilizer application, presence of a pollutant load attenuation best management practice like a detention pond or bioswale, and the receiving water quality must all be ground-truthed with in-situ observations [22–24]."
3,"this means that the vast potential of remote sensing can only truly be exploited in those areas where atmospheric conditions are generally conducive to remote sensing, and where some access to the watershed is possible."
3,we leverage geospatial datasets containing information on atmospheric conditions and accessibility to rank subwatersheds according to their propensity to being amenable to remote sensing for water quality monitoring under a variety of cost-payoff scenarios.
3,"reasons for the gap between the number of this assessment and monitored waterbod- ies and the total number of waterbodies in the united states can include (i) applicability, (ii) accessibility, (iii) resource constrains and (iv) socioeconomics."
3,"first, in most cases, waterbodies might be located in remote, locations with minimal human development and limited beneficial uses to society apart from preserving pristine natural beauty and bounty."
3,"second, there may be access issues due to rugged landforms, impassable land use features and limited mobility networks which make monitoring difficult or even impos- sible."
3,"third, state, tribal and local agencies tasked with assessing and programmatically attaining designated uses for waterbodies may be hampered by resource constraints that make regular ambient monitoring and synoptic data collection difficult or even impossible in all watersheds."
3,"fourth, there may be environmental justice issues with impairment being linked to socioeconomic and demographic conditions (e.g., [25])."
3,"in this paper, we only look at the first three factors, as we are only interested in the technical constraints of feasibility of using remote sensing for water quality monitoring and data collection here."
3,"the advantage of remote sensing over conventional monitoring programs is that for areas where the former is applicable, ground-truthing need not be performed very often, and in"
4,"water 2022, 14, 1985 4 of 16 the overall life cycle of monitoring and data collection programs, can be significantly less expensive to implement, particularly if public domain data and tools are used."
4,"the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we describe our classification approach, the datasets we used and the geostatistical methods we adopted."
4,"in section 3, we showcase the remote sensing potential map."
4,"in section 4, we discuss where in the country gaps need to be filled, given the potential for remote sensing by looking at the applicability and accessibility of the subwatersheds and the intersection of quantified risks of impairment, ecological vulnerability and lack of coverage."
4,"finally, also in section 4, we outline the caveats in our approach, and chart our future trajectory in making these classifications more robust and readily accessible to the watershed management community."
4,materials and methods our fundamental premise is that we can determine the potential of remote sensing to be useful for ambient monitoring and synoptic data collection in a given waterbody by mapping this potential at the usgs’ hydrologic unit code 12 (huc-12) subwatershed scale.
4,"the huc-12 subwatershed classification allows us to analyze watersheds at the 1:24,000 scale."
4,"at this scale, these subwatersheds typically contain four stream segments, except in a few larger subwatersheds in the northeast and the great lakes."
4,"we feel that this spatial scale is sufficient to identify the potential for remote sensing, as the streams encompassed within these subwatersheds are usually higher order distributaries or small areal bodies with similar climate, land use and terrain characteristics."
4,"in total, there are 102,973 huc-12 subwatersheds in the conterminous united states."
4,we discuss our approach in section 2.1 below.
4,"we used numerous geographical information system (gis) resources in this study to map access, acquisition, constraints and risks of impairment."
4,"all gis operations and visualizations were performed in qgis [26], while the model development was performed in matlab [27]."
4,"in determining the potential for remote sensing and its applications, we used existing accessibility and image acquisition conditions, and did not account for the effects of land use and land cover change or climate change."
4,"after determining the potential of remote sensing as a data source within each subwatershed, we subsequently subset subwatersheds on the basis of applicability and resource constraints as described in section 2.2 below."

5,potential for remote sensing as a tool to collect data on the subwatershed scale we used the mean annual fraction of cloudy days from the earthenv global cloud cover model dataset [28] as a surrogate to indicate how likely it is to acquire remote sensing imagery of a 1 km2 scene and how hard it is to process this imagery for use (figure 2a).
5,this dataset includes 1 km resolution mean conditions between the period of 2001 and 2014.
5,"we used the global map of minimum travel times from a location to a population center (defined as a city or township with more than 50,000 people) produced by the malaria atlas project [29] as a surrogate for accessibility to a given 1 km2 grid cell (figure 2b)."
5,"this raster map is the outcome of a geospatial travel time model that takes existing road and rail networks, land cover and 30 m resolution digital terrain models of the entire globe."
5,"the combination of these two datasets, respectively indicate how likely it is to acquire a scene remotely, and how easy it is to ground-truth reflectances to link the remotely sensed data to land cover characteristics and water quality impairments."
5,"the tacit assumption is that it will be possible for stakeholders tasked with managing the watershed to reach any major population center, and then travel from there to perform in-situ sampling work."
5,"to link these datasets to the hydrological units of interest, we used the usgs’ national hydrography dataset’s (nhdplus) huc-12 layer [3]."

7,"water 2022, 14, 1985 7 of 16 values of the acquisition and access variables (table 3)."
7,"these weights effectively lower the τshortest max and µcloud cover threshold values, respectively for the accessibility and acquisition criteria for the different categories going from conservative to normal to optimistic estimates of the cost-payoff relationships (table 3)."
7,"for example, one regulatory agency may be willing to send an engineer on a six-hour long journey to collect water quality data."
7,"so, any value of τshortest max,i smaller than six hours for a subwatershed within the jurisdiction of this agency would get a c τshortest  max value of 3."
7,another agency may decide that it does not want its engineers to spend more than one hour traveling to a remote site.
7,"in this case, the c τshortest shortest larger  max for any τ max than one hour would be 2 or lower."
7,"similarly, a consultant may be willing to invest the effort into building robust processing pipelines to deal with largely cloudy scenes or invest time and resources in data fusion-based cloud removal algorithms that are becoming more popular across various platforms [30,31]."
7,this consultant would perhaps be willing to assign a c(µcloud cover ) value of 2 or higher for a subwatershed where the sky is likely to be cloudy for almost 75% of the days in the year.
7,another consultant who is perhaps geared to directly use analysis-ready products may assign a c(µcloud cover ) value of 3 for their subwatershed only if the sky is likely to be clear for 75% of the days in the year.
7,"by presenting maps of the categorical levels of the potential across a range of c(·) values, we allow decision-makers to choose the cost-payoff level they are comfortable with to plan their workflows accordingly."
7,quantifying benefits of remote sensing in watershed monitoring we modeled the potential for remote sensing using equation (1) and surrogates for accessibility and acquisition.
7,"however, these maps in themselves provide only one piece of the puzzle."
7,it is only when the potential for watershed monitoring using remote sensing is combined with risk maps and lack of coverage by conventional monitoring that areas can be identified where remote sensing can play a crucial role.
7,"to do this, we developed maps of five metrics of risk using published gis data from the enviroatlas [32] (table 2): (i) the human footprint, (ii) anthropogenic water demand, (iii) ecosystem vulnerability, (iv) impairment, and (v) conventional monitoring and assessment coverage gaps."
7,"as the units of these metrics are different from one another, we simply overlaid these maps and determined the intersecting areas to determine where the remote sensing role would be most useful."
7,human footprint: we collected the human population in each subwatershed.
7,the conventional wisdom is that impairment and watershed management matter most where human settlements are prevalent.
7,the subwatersheds populations were then ranked from 0 to 6 with decadal increase from less than 10 to more than one million people.
7,"anthropogenic water demand: we combined the domestic, agricultural, industrial and thermoelectric water demand in each subwatershed to estimate the total water demand from each subwatershed."
7,watersheds with greater demand are likely to experience larger ecological deficit flows and a higher propensity for critical conditions of impairment.
7,"the subwatershed demands were then ranked from 0 to 6 with decadal increase from less than 12,000 gallons per day (gpd) [the per capital daily water demand is 1200 gpd estimated by dividing the total water demand by the total population]."
7,ecosystem vulnerability: we combined three key ecosystem services with equal weigh- tage to each to estimate an overall vulnerability index.
7,"first, we summed the average number of days in a year that hunting, fishing, and recreational activities are typically engaged in within a subwatershed to obtain a fractional recreation time, f recreation ."
7,large values of this number indicate greater pressure for recreational activities.
7,"second, we com- bined the total fraction of land cover earmarked for conservation by both the international union for nature conservation (iucn) and the united states government, f conservation ."
7,"large values of this number indicate that additional monitoring, assessment, and restora- tion effort must be expended in these subwatersheds."
7,"third, we collected the native aquatic species vulnerability index, f vulnerability , a key measure of how many endangered, native"
8,"water 2022, 14, 1985 8 of 16 species are threatened [33]."
8,this index is also a proxy for ecosystem health in general.
8,higher values of this index imply generally poorer ecosystem health.
8,all these numbers range from 0 to 1.
8,"the overall ecosystem vulnerability of the subwatershed is then   f = w f recreation irecreation + f conservation iconservation + f vulnerability ivulnerability (2) where ii is an indicator that can either be 0 or 1 depending on whether the service i, i.e., recreation, conservation or species vulnerability, is being provided by the subwatershed or not, and w is 1, 0.5 or 0.33 if there are one, two or all three of the services being provided by the subwatershed."
8,"the subwatersheds ecosystem vulnerability indicator was then ranked 0 for no vulnerability, and then from 1 to 4 in increments of 0.25."
8,"impairment risk: we developed subindex curves of the total wastewater discharge in million gallons per day (mgd), the total permitted pollutant load in pounds per year, and the total agricultural overland, tile and non-tile subsurface runoff in mm as described in walsh and wheeler [34]."
8,we then combined these subindices using a maximum subindex measure as the overall index of impairment within a subwatershed.
8,this index was deemed to represent the impairment risk in the subwatershed.
8,"to develop these subindex curves the following approach was adopted: first, we summed the total load in each class, i.e., wastewater, permitted sources, and agricultural runoff, and divided it by the total surface area of waterbodies within the watershed to normalize loads across subwatersheds."
8,"then we omitted zero values and obtained the 25th, 50th and 75th quantiles of these normalized loads across all the subwatersheds in the country and assigned rank values from 0 to 4 depending on whether there was no impairment from that loading class to whatever quantile range the normalized loads fell into."
8,this effectively positioned the normalized loads in each load class onto a subindex curve.
8,"then, as the nature of impairment is likely to vary depending on the dominant economic sector, human activity, and land surface processes in each subwatershed, we took the overall impairment risk to be the maximum of the three rank values."
8,"thus, higher values of this index (ranging from 0 to 4) represents higher risk of impairment."
8,"conventional monitoring and assessment coverage gaps: for each subwatershed, we es- timated the total length of assessed stream segments, lstream , the total area of assessed ponds, lakes, and estuaries, abody , and the total number of monitoring stations, nstation , from the assessment and total maximum daily load tracking and implementation system (attains) database [4]."
8,a subwatershed was determined to have a monitoring gap if lstream + abody + nstation = 0.
8,"finally, we also produced a remote sensing monitoring potential map using the normal cost-payoff estimates from table 3 to indicate where remote sensing would be likely feasible."
8,"subwatersheds where the role of remote sensing is likely to be most crucial were then classified as those that met the decision tree in figure 3, that is, where all the layers after suitable thresholding to represent various risks intersect with at least good potential for remote sensing."

13,"water 2022, 14, 1985 13 of 16 are monitored regularly, and even when they are, in-situ monitoring costs can typically exceed several hundred thousands of dollars a year within a small watershed [38], and (ii) remote sensing can provide long-term cost savings."
13,remote sensing potential maps could be constructed for specific applications outlined in the introduction by suitably modifying the factors considered in the model presented in section 2.1.
13,"for example, if a consultant proposes a data fusion pipeline using sentinel 2, modis, and planet imagery [39] to study watershed health, heavy metal concentrations in a nearby lake, and the role of watershed best management practices, then the principal costs of image acquisition will likely be the cost of procuring high-resolution planet imagery, while in-situ monitoring costs will likely be driven by personnel costs rather than access time."
13,there are several caveats to the maps we have produced here.
13,"first, the assumptions built into the earthenv cloud cover and the malaria atlas travel time databases carry over to our maps."
13,"while these data sources are excellent for global coverage at the kilometer-scale, our pipeline may be refined with source dems and spectral imagery for specific watersheds to systematically downscale our national coverage maps."
13,"the shortest time to reach a population center, while somewhat ad-hoc, is an appropriate metric to characterize the difficulty of ground-truthing remote sensing imagery because typically waterbodies outside major population centers are not monitored."
13,"however, as we show in figure 5d, such areas are also at high risk of impairment."
13,"second, our remote sensing potential model is extremely simple and steady state, and yet captures the underlying tradeoff between scene acquisition and ground-truthing."
13,"within a watershed, multiple process-scales exist, ranging from storms and coastal upwelling events that happen on hourly to daily timescales, land use and land cover changes that happen on annual to decadal timescales, and landform changes that happen over many decades to centuries [40]."
13,our maps do not factor in these different timescales.
13,"more sophisticated models, including spatial kriging approaches and gaussian process models that incorporate seasonal variability in scene acquisition and travel time can be developed."
13,"cloud cover, for instance, can vary seasonally so that even in areas with many cloudy days, there can be periods with clear skies during which period field campaigns could be planned."
13,we do not capture such nuances here.
13,"for simple applications that require only a single remote sensing image such as a national agricultural image program [41] or landsat scene, cloud cover may not even be an issue if the acquisition window can be carefully determined."
13,"although many non-dimensional metrics for land use and land cover classification for characterizing the environment can be derived from multi- and hyperspectral imagery in most locations within the united states, as we showed in figure 1, there are still significant data gaps that require physical ground-truthing for which our maps will be useful."
13,"third, we have operated at the huc-12 subwatershed scale in this project for computational tractability."
13,"however, much finer reach-scale resolution of the impaired waterbodies can be incorporated within our pipeline by combining the nhdplus and attains datasets using cloud platforms such as google’s earth engine [37]."
13,"fourth, our thresholds for cloud cover and minimum travel time to population centers for the various cost-payoff scenarios are somewhat arbitrary, but still indicate sensible and meaningful trends in the remote sensing potential maps."
13,this is a reflection of the fact that we have sacrificed specificity to different remote sensing technologies for the generality of our guidance maps.
13,these thresholds can be more rigorously defined for different types of remote sensing platforms by combining the atmospheric conditions and ground-truthing needs of specific technologies.
13,"fifth, while we have chosen risk metrics that largely encompass most risk factors for watershed impairments, a more thorough exploration of available datasets, particularly socioeconomic data, is possible to identify other, transdisciplinary benefits of remote sensing within a watershed."
13,"it is likely that such exhaustive inclusion must be done on a local municipal, county, or state scale than on the national scale for disparate factors to sensibly be combined at meaningful physical scales."
13,"in subsequent iterations of these products, we will tackle these advances."
13,"sixth, we only considered terrestrial subwatersheds in our current pipeline, and excluded all coastal and"
14,"water 2022, 14, 1985 14 of 16 great lakes impairments."
14,"in subsequent iterations of these maps, we will include these areas as well."
14,"while we have developed the pipeline for the united states, a similar workflow could be developed anywhere in the world, or even for the entire planet."
14,"the only consideration is that while earth explorer, the united states environmental protection agency, and the enviroatlas catalog a wide array of geospatial datasets for immediate use, such data may be difficult to find in the international landscape, and may have to be stitched together from disparate sources of information."
14,"nonetheless, for any serious, reproducible, and scalable application of remote sensing for monitoring and data collection on watershed loads and impairments, this is a necessary first step."
14,"for the first time ever, a product is available that will allow researchers and managers to evaluate the potential of remote sensing to augment, or even fulfill ambient monitoring and data collection needs throughout the united states."
14,"we hope that our maps will be useful for the watershed managers within the united states, even as we continue to improve them with finer granularity and additional factors."
