1,abstract: shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (iczm).
1,"it provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides in- formation necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones."
1,"shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability."
1,"for monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could beneﬁt policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern."
1,"however, various gnss methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difﬁcult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach."
1,"using a case study of the pernambuco state iczm in brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used gnss-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (rk), real-time kinematic (rtk), and precise point positioning (ppp) methods."
1,it also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations.
1,"the results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable gnss method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for support- ing iczm policies."

4,the basic configuration for this technique consists of a receiver fixed at a point a with known coordinates and a rover at a point b [similar to the configuration of the rk method in fig. 2(a)].
4,"the dif- ference between rtk and rk methods, however, is that rtk is ca- pable of delivering real-time positions in the field as opposed to rk, thus alleviating the need for postprocessing the data."
4,"similar to the rk technique discussed previously, rtk also requires more than two receivers, with one placed at a reference (base station) sta- tion and both measuring carrier phases."
4,"for rtk, the receiver at the control station attached to a radio transmitter samples data every second and transmits these raw data together with its position (along with the antenna height) via the communication link (e.g., satellites, mobile phones, radio) to the roving receiver attached to a radio receiver (awange 2012)."
4,"using its radio receiver, the rover receives the transmitted data from the base receiver and uses its built-in software to combine and process the gnss measurements obtained at both the base and roving re- ceiver to obtain its position in real time (el-rabbany 2006, p."

8,"however, the precision of the methods must be interpreted with caution because standard errors of gnss measurements tend to be overambitious in practice."
