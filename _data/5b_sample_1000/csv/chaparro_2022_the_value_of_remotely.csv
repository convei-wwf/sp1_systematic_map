1,this led to the development of species distribution models (sdms) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables.
1,"so far, sdms rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determi- nant of bird distributions."
1,"while remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys."
1,"in this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance."
1,"specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in south-western germany."
1,‘remote sensing sdms’ related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees.
1,alternative ‘field survey sdms’ related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees.
1,"additionally, both remote sensing and field survey sdms included climate and land use variables."
1,accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use.
1,"the impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species."
1,"the remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abun- dance of seven species."
1,"in contrast, multiple field-surveyed variables had similar effect strength, with the overall strongest effect found for pear tree density, to which seven bird species showed a unimodal response."
1,these analyses have conservation implications since they predict expected responses of bird species to ongoing changes in orchard structure.
1,"moreover, they identify structural variables that will be most promising to measure via remote sensing data in the future."

2,beide modelle enthielten zusätzlich klima- und landnutzungsvariablen.
2,"generell verbesserte die berücksichtigung von detaillierten strukturvariablen die abundanzvorhersage für sieben der neun untersuchten vogelarten im vergleich zu modellen, die lediglich klima- und landnutzungsvariablen enthalten."
2,fernerkundungs- und geländevariablen unterschieden sich erheblich in ihrem einfluss auf die modellgüte.
2,"fernerkundungsvariablen verbesserten die modellgüte für den großteil der untersuchten vogelarten (n = 7), während geländevariablen variableren einfluss zeigten und die modellgüte für fünf arten sogar verringerten."
2,"die fernerkundungsvariable mit dem stärksten effekt ist die gesamtbaumdichte, die sich positiv auf die abundanz von sieben arten auswirkte."
2,"im gegensatz dazu hatten mehrere geländevariablen ähnliche effektstärken, wobei der stärkste effekt für die birnbaumdichte resultierte, auf die sieben arten eine unimodale reaktion zeigten."

3,a suitable system for studying effects of habitat structure on bird distribution and abundance are traditional orchards.
