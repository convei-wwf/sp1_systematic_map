1,multispectral imagery by the landsat program has been an invaluable landsat resource for forest type characterization for several decades.
1,"as an alternative to traditional classiﬁcation ap- central hardwoods proaches dominating these eﬀorts, we instead employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping forest gradient mapping composition as ﬂoristic gradients across a ∼5000-km2 forestland in southeastern ohio’s central hardwoods."
1,plot ordination-regression data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) from a comprehensive sample of both overstory and understory woody plants across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) ordination solution.
1,"floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reﬂectance provided by a multitemporal landsat 8-operational land imager (oli) image and various terrain variables using random forests models."
1,"approximately 61%, 49%, and 25% of the ﬂoristic variation among the three axes of the nmds ordination were related to the remotely-sensed vari- ables during regression modeling."
1,"the axes were predicted onto three images and merged to a rgb color composite for the ﬁnal ﬂoristic gradient map, displaying multivariate vegetation variation across the landscape in terms of variation in color."
1,"the color values, by referencing ordination space position within the original solution, provide a statistical approximation of the taxonomic composition of individual forest stands in relation to the plot data."
1,we found this approach highly eﬀective and an attractive alternative to traditional classiﬁca- tions.
1,"it is time-eﬃcient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is expressed in continuous ﬁelds rather than arbitrary breaks, and less subjective, overcoming the generalization problem inherent in categorizing ve- getation assemblages a priori."
1,"moving forward, our model will be a valuable tool in developing suitable man- agement options on individual forest stands for the restoration of desired species, adapting to a changing climate, and improving wildlife habitat in forestlands across the central hardwoods."
