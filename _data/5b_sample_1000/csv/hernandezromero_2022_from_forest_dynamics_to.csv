2,"introduction as water is the most valuable and limited resource for biodiversity, comprehensive knowledge of water-related ecosystem functioning is essential for developing an integrated management scheme that assures its sustainability [1–3]."
2,"to establish priority actions on water resources worldwide, spatial assessment and environmental mapping play an essential role in defining critical areas for conservation and ecological restoration [4,5]."
2,"in the context of global change, land use and land cover (lulc) changes resulting from urban, farmland and livestock expansion [6,7] have led to the destruction of habitats, ecosystem functionality and the historical services they offer to society [8,9]."
2,"ecosystem services (es) are the direct and indirect contributions that ecosystems provide to human well-being and quality of life [10,11]."
2,they are essential for sustaining life on earth and represent an accurate indicator of an ecosystem’s health [12–15].
2,"the most important disturbances are related to (i) the loss of forest stands [16,17]; (ii) fragmentation of extensive, original forests in patched mosaics [18,19]; and (iii) soil erosion and water and soil contamination [20–22]."
2,"therefore, understanding how es responds to anthropogenic changes is necessary to assess and balance short-term needs with long-term sustainability goals [23,24]."
2,"aquatic ecosystems, including wetlands and water bodies, provide different and essential functions and es, such as habitat for wildlife, water filtration, flood protection or carbon storage [25,26]."
2,wetlands are typically located at defined depressions in the ground or where the water table is close to the surface [27].
2,"there is extensive evidence that aquatic ecosystem functions can be impaired by modification of the adjacent lulc change, bringing on siltation processes at different levels [28,29]."
2,"in this regard, forests play an essential role in maintaining ecosystem functions relevant to aquatic ecosystems, such as modifying soil structure, allowing better infiltration and water retention, maintaining more stable runoff levels during drying season [30], playing a decisive role in the overall water cycle by balancing infiltration–evapotranspiration–runoff [31] and reducing soil erosion and sediment transport towards receiving streams [32]."
2,"in developed countries, woodlands and shrublands have regenerated naturally since the 19th century because of rural depopulation and land abandonment in marginal ar- eas [33,34]."
2,"this involved the expansion of forest land and an increase in the maturity of forest ecosystems and, therefore, their capacity to provide regulating es such as ero- sion protection, hydrological stability or water quality maintenance [35]."
2,"consequently, land management strategies such as rewilding are currently at the forefront of european adaptation policies as a way to recover forest cover [36,37]."
2,rewilding implies passive management of ecological succession to restore natural ecosystem processes and minimise human control of landscapes.
2,"this allows for maximising environmental and socioeco- nomic benefits in rural areas undergoing changes such as land abandonment [38,39]."
2,"we focused on soil erosion because it is one of the biggest threats to wetland conser- vation, involving negative impacts such as eutrophication and increased risk of flooding and landslides [40,41]."
2,"in this regard, regulating ecosystem services for soil erosion pre- vention is paramount in mountainous areas [42]."
2,"we evaluated, in this work, soil erosion at three stages concerning natural and human drivers."
2,"the first stage consists of an initial detachment of individual particles from the soil mass, subsequent transportation by erosion agents—principally wind and water—and final siltation into land depressions or delivery to water bodies."
2,"sediment detachment is not exclusively the result of raindrop impacts [43,44] but also originates in the overland flow as an erosive agent [45]."
2,"both factors generate shear stress on the soil surface: if the cohesive soil strength is exceeded, sediment detachment occurs [46]."
2,"sediment enters the river dissolved or as fragments eroded from the adjacent hills, banks or channels [47]."
2,"at the same time, streamflow provides the driving force that transports the sediment downstream within river corridors."
2,"hence, surface and subsurface water fluxes are strongly influenced by river characteristics, including valley and channel ge- ometry, vegetation, biota and human activities [48]."
2,"wetland siltation occurs when the eroded material transported by river channels or overland flow settles out of the water column onto the surface as the water flow slows down [49,50]."
2,"when this occurs, the presence of sediment"
3,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 1864 3 of 22 often significantly reduces water and the quality of the aquatic habitat for biota [51]."
3,it makes water bodies more turbid and does not allow light to penetrate the water column [52].
3,"furthermore, suspended sediment can clog the gills of aquatic organisms, cover the stream bottom leading to the suffocation of fish eggs and benthic macroinvertebrates [53] and reduce dissolved oxygen levels due to higher water temperatures [54]."
3,"additionally, pesticides, some metals and other pollutants may cling to suspended sediment in the water and increase the concentration of the contaminants and toxins [55,56]."
3,"therefore, there is a need for direct and indirect management actions to avoid diffuse sources of sediment and pollutants, mainly related to soil erosion and runoff after rainfall events in deforested areas [57]."
3,"in cases where rainfall erosion occurs, these downstream effects are often significant and can cause severe environmental and economic damages [58]."
3,"nowadays, nature-based solutions (nbs) are gaining considerable socio-political trac- tion as evidence mounts regarding the multiple regulating es and the biodiversity they provide [59]."
3,nbs is used as an umbrella framework encompassing multiple conservation and restoration managing strategies applied over natural and semi-natural ecosystems to enhance es provision and biodiversity [60].
3,"the standard approach is mainly based on using natural processes and cycles of organisms, matter and energy, taking advantage of the ecosystem’s properties and following their seasonal and temporal dynamics [61]."
3,"therefore, they are sustainable over time for potentially maintaining multiple ecosystem functions alternatively or simultaneously [62]."
3,"in this sense, nbs might be able to improve the ecosys- tem where they are embedded."
3,"their effects might span across ecosystem boundaries (i.e., meta-ecosystem) [63]."
3,"as shown in [64], these properties make them particularly recom- mendable for managing aquatic ecosystems based on their biotic and abiotic exchanges with terrestrial habitats."
3,"to identify areas for nbs implementation, we can use different tools for semiautomatic analyses at a regional scale, characterising landscape patterns and pro- cesses at a geographical scale and temporal resolution to match the ecosystem processes of interest."
3,"in this sense, rs is a source of earth observation data of great interest in landscape studies given its ability to follow dynamic processes [65,66]."
3,"rs has become a critical tool for landscape monitoring given its capacity to generate spatially continuous, regular and repeatable observations over large areas."
3,"it is a primary source of information for global monitoring of ecosystem processes, along with national statistics, field-based observations and numerical modelling [67,68]."
3,"among its applications, lulc characterisation is one of the most developed branches in conjunction with geographic information systems (gis), computational capabilities and statistical techniques developed over the last decades."
3,"all have turned ecological models into powerful tools for spatial analysis aimed at (i) exploring the various mechanisms that force changes in lulc, as well as their social and economic driving forces, (ii) projecting the potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts de- rived from these changes across future scenarios, and (iii) assessing the influence of policy alternatives and management regimes on ecosystems functionality [65]."
3,"much of the work to protect aquatic ecosystems, particularly from siltation effects, is based on creating vegetated buffer strips for stream management [69,70]."
3,"beyond this, the quality of the services generated depends largely on the conservation state of forest stands [71,72]."
3,"therefore, the ecosystem function is defined by the extension, structure and composition of forest patches and the optimal distribution across the landscape of these vegetation barriers [73–75]."
3,"however, very few publications address this problem from a comprehensive point of view, including reducing sediment production in the headwaters, sediment transport in river channels or diffuse runoff and final siltation in receiving water bodies."
3,"objectives the main objective of this work is to apply an rs-based framework to identify suitable locations related to the conservation and restoration of natural forests in hillslopes and riparian areas that reduce the risk of soil erosion and increase sediment filtering, respectively."
3,this approach will allow analysis of the vulnerability of siltation on wetland ecosystems

4,"to do so, we carried out a series of specific steps: • mapping lulc dynamics from 1989 to 2019 by coupling landsat and sentinel 2 imagery."
4,• modelling forest distribution in a future scenario for 2049 based on a reliable maximum forest cover increment defined for the study area.
4,• mapping current wetlands distribution supported by extensive fieldwork and photo- interpretation.

4,"study area the study area covers the sella, cares and deva catchments, which extend across the northern slopes of the cantabrian cordillera (spain) with a total surface area of 2485.20 km2 that spans more than 400 km parallel to the cantabrian sea [33] (figure 1)."
4,"the current morphology results from small-scale tectonic movements and the action of wind, fluvial and glacier erosive agents, thus forming very active geosystems that gave rise to a great diversity of landscapes [76]."
4,"the climate is humid, oceanic and temperate [73], and the region is subdivided into different biogeographical provinces distributed along the colino, montano, subalpine and alpine bioclimatic floors [77]."
4,"combined with steep terrain and sharp altitudinal gradients, they make the mountain range a longitudinal, and sometimes a transversal, border for species transit [76]."
4,"this heterogeneity of conditions means that the region is home to one of the greatest botanical richnesses of the european mountain regions [78], as well as an enormous wealth of fauna, including 18 species of amphibians, 22 reptiles, 190 breeding birds and 67 mammals [79–81]."
4,"in addition, the above-mentioned border effect translates into a high percentage of endemism [82]."
4,"due to the borderline na- ture, i.e., where different ecosystems converge between the atlantic and the mediterranean regions, the area is highly sensitive to climate change [76]."
4,short and steep rivers with great erosive power [83] and frequent floods of varying magnitude [84] characterise the area’s hydrology.
4,"the biodiversity of aquatic systems in the region, including river networks and lentic elements such as lagoons, lakes, springs and peat bogs (i.e., wetlands from now on), show a high richness of diatoms, macroinvertebrates and amphibians [76,78]."
4,"local endorheic lakes formed by the action of glacial ice during the pleistocene [85] created complex hydrological networks with streams, wetlands and other water bodies which are highly connected and interdependent [86]."
4,"wetlands are more complex to identify and characterise, and are usually former glacial lakes or the result of an outcrop of water in flat terrain, which is very common due to the predominance of limestone materials throughout the territory [26,86]."
4,"the land cover gradient is characterised by the legacy of human management and land- use practices, which dates from the neolithic [87] and whose influence on the forest has been prominent since the 13th and 14th centuries [88]."
4,"in the last 400 years, this influence has been based on deforestation for stockbreeding, agriculture and wood production through the combined use of fire and traditional agricultural techniques."
4,"these heavily managed landscapes [88,89] suffered further transformations during recent decades because of land abandonment and rural exodus [90], with the subsequent increase in the occupied area and density of forests and shrublands [91,92] and the decrease of crops, pastures and grasslands [89,93]."
4,"in contrast, large parts of the study area have not experienced major historical deforestation and present mature eurosiberian forest patches of beech (fagus sylvatica), birches (betula ssp.), oaks (quercus robur) and mediterranean vegetation in lowlands (quercus pyrenaica or q. ilex)."
4,"here, the presence of brown bear (ursus arctos) and cantabrian capercaillie (tetrao urogallus cantabricus) demonstrates a better landscape conservation status [76,94,95]."

5,"some data were also validated through google street view to assure this [99,100]."

7,"in turn, lulc classification in the past was developed over a time series of 41 cloud-free landsat images collected from 1989 to 2019, processed with nasa’s landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system (ledaps)."
7,"such data were obtained from the us geological survey (usgs) earth explorer archive (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed on 21 september 2020)."
7,"similar to the previous process, a minimum amount of cloud cover and high elevation angles were required, which focused the search on images taken during the summer period of each year."
7,"we used the same s2 mosaic to map wetland distribution, but corrected it with the icor algorithm as it presents a better performance for water-related ecosystems [105,106]."
7,we generated two specific spectral indices related to water presence—the normal difference water index (ndmi) and the automated water extraction index (aweinsh) [107–109].
7,"furthermore, we created the topographic wetness index (twi), derived from topographical attributes, to define the areas with the highest potential for moisture accumulation [110]."
7,mapping lulc trends and wetlands distribution lulc classification has been made for three time periods spanning 30 years (1989–2019–2049).
7,"the beginning of any supervised classification involves the definition of the legend, i.e., in which categories the image is going to be classified."
7,table 1 shows the legend for the present study based on the typologies used in [111] according to vegetation physiognomic units that assure an optimal classification with medium resolution sensors in heterogeneous and mountainous environments.
7,we then applied a per-pixel supervised classification using a support vector machine algorithm (svm) which collected in situ data and the predictors explained above.
7,"the svm algorithm generates a hard map, assuming homogeneous pixels across the landscape continuum and creating a complete classification for the s2 mosaic."
7,"when one pixel does not belong entirely to any defined class, the algorithm assigns it as “not evaluated” or to the category with the highest probability of belonging [112]."
7,"therefore, the process calculates an uncertainty that can be evaluated by complementary soft-classification approaches and used to refine lulc patterns and trends [111]."
7,the analysis of lulc dynamics requires assuring spectral coherence between landsat and sentinel images.
7,"radiometric differences must be considered due to aspects such as phenology and vegetation growth rates, varying atmospheric conditions, soil moisture or the presence of aerosols that may modify boa reflectance and therefore affect the post- classification comparison of lulc patterns."
7,"without a high temporal resolution of lulc maps over time, the performance of an adequate atmospheric and topographic correction, the quality of the training data or even the selection of images during the summer period do not guarantee lulc comparability over time, which may result in inconsistent change detection [65,101]."
7,"here, we applied a sensitivity analysis that calculates the averaged values of ndvi for each lulc category defined in the legend for the year 2019 and searched the most spectrally similar image in the past, even when dealing with different sensors, thus guaranteeing comparability of maps over time."
7,"we then calculated the ndvi value for each in situ data point for the whole series of landsat and s2 images, together with the 25th and 75th percentiles between which the interquartile range is found, i.e., 50% of the sample values (see figure 3)."
7,"these averages are then calculated for each category and landsat image in the time series, identifying all in situ data points within the current image’s interquartile range."
7,"in this way, the june 1989 scene was selected as the one that assures a larger consistency in the time series for the lulc change analysis."
7,"after selecting the scene, lulc classification was performed similarly to s2, applying the svm algorithm and using only the reference points of each category with ndvi values within the interquartile range"
8,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 1864 8 of 22 to keep the spectral unmixing of lulc categories as much as possible."

13,"discussion in this work, we applied a novel rs-based modelling approach that couples forest dynamics and potential wetlands siltation to identify optimal areas for implementing nbs that regulate sediment flows in mountainous systems."
13,landscape modelling approach lulc mapping has been based on sensitivity analysis to detect spectrally comparable satellite images from different sensors within a time series of landsat and s2 scenes.
13,"various studies showed that both sensors are directly comparable after a toa correction when the images were taken on the same date [129,130]."
13,other studies developed a time-series- based reflectance adjustment (tra) approach for reducing the reflectance differences between both sensor observations after a toa correction [131] and linear regression models to adjust reflectance differences between sensors for each pixel and spectral band.
13,"we developed here a simplified, conservative approach that maintains the original values of band images."
13,"to achieve this, we based our analyses on a sensitivity selection by ndvi according to the lulc legend to obtain comparable data at the boa level."
13,"the rs-based modelling of wetlands allows assessing the uncertainty of boundaries ex- tracted by automated algorithms in complex landscapes against expert-based data collected on the ground [101,132,133]."
13,these rs-based models’ uncertainties can be linked to several issues.
13,one deals with the nature of wetland typologies.
13,"among the 282 wetlands reference points, we have different typologies including lagoons, lakes and peat bogs."
13,"with the 10 m pixel size of the s2 images, we are, in principle, able to identify some of these aquatic systems [134,135]."
13,"nevertheless, other aquatic ecosystems such as cattle watering holes or springs are locations where the image pixel’s size and spectral uncertainty may preclude mapping their occurrence on the ground."
13,"a second reason can be related to the need for the temporal dynamics (i.e., phenology or seasonal trends) of satellite information to catch up with the systems’ properties that allow for reliable mapping exercises."
13,"in [136,137], among studies, has been demonstrated the capability of using satellite image time series to map and monitor biodiversity patterns at a large scale."
13,"moving beyond the validation of wetland occurrences (i.e., made here by overlying modelled patterns and reference points), we assessed the method’s capability for matching the spatial pattern of wetlands mapped using expert criteria and aerial photographs."
13,"in general, we observed an overestimation"
14,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 1864 14 of 22 of the models over photointerpretation patterns."
14,"nevertheless, assessing local boundary uncertainty or fuzzy boundary width in wetlands may result in artificial and not wholly reliable in the base of existing images of known class characteristics and locations, and this may hamper discrimination and variability [138,139]."
14,discrimination consists of the ability of the photointerpreter (or an algorithm) to detect a difference in texture.
14,"vari- ability consists on the intrinsic spatial variability of the texture itself because of the fuzzy boundaries [138,140]."
14,"acknowledging these complexities, we determine that rs-based modelling of wetlands may help examine the effect of context on boundary uncertainty in complex landscapes, i.e., how one might assess the uncertainty of boundaries extracted by automated algorithms based on rs against reliable data collected on the ground to advance more reliable and automatic mapping procedures."
14,"nevertheless, this issue needs further research to determine the omission and commission errors of both techniques."
14,the combination of lulc and wetland distributions in this work allowed assessing the potential flow of sediment following a meta-ecosystem perspective [63].
14,"this identified, on the one hand, all potential pathways of sediment through terrestrial landforms to wetlands, but also depicted where terrestrial ecosystems are connected to these abiotic flows in order to reduce the magnitude of the sedimentation processes in target wetlands."
14,"in this sense, erosion at the source, sediment transport and sediment deposition has been analysed independently."
14,"this is a major advance over other approaches that either consider only some of the processes in isolation, or cannot spatially discretise them to assess accurately in which terrestrial structures they occur [141–143]."
14,"in this way, our methodology identifies not only different forest habitats (e.g., riparian forests or hillside forests), but also different managing strategies (e.g., conservation or restoration), that could be applied at various scales and locations to reduce the sediment transfer between terrestrial and wetland ecosystems."
14,"therefore, using the proposed approach, we could first prioritise which locations need urgent actions and which are not at risk from erosive sediment inputs."
14,"furthermore, we could identify over which process and locations we can act more effectively, e.g., erosion production at the source, sediment transport by rills and channels or sedimentation in flat areas."
14,"implications for landscape management our results show that, in the study area, most of the sediment is generated in the headwaters."
14,"this is in agreement with other studies carried out in mountainous territories where slope steepness and convergence cause surface and subsurface flow to become concentrated and thus contribute to soil erosion [117,118,144]."
14,"in this sense, vegetation is an important agent for stabilizing steep regolith-mantled slopes."
14,"vegetation reinforces the regolith with roots [145,146] and, to a lesser extent, modifies soil moisture and subsurface hydrology through transpiration, canopy interception, the redistribution of rainwater and the development of preferential flow paths via root systems [147,148]."
14,"from an ecological point of view, more complex ecosystems and mature vegetation contribute to greater protection of the soil properties [40]."
14,"in fact, woody vegetation stabilizes soil surfaces by impeding soil movement, generating lower losses in comparison to other vegetation types [149–151]."
14,"in our study area, forest conservation actions would not affect large extents (around 4% of the total area implied in sediment flows), so fully preserving its current adequate condition should be a priority."
14,"however, as has been quantified by [64] for the same study area, an important part of the sediment is generated in areas where forests are not present, now nor in the future, because of limiting abiotic factors such as altitude, slopes and climatic conditions [101]."
14,"in this sense, the total area of sediment generation is significantly larger than the 229.96 ha (table 3) identified in our study as a potential area to reduce the production of sediment in wetlands."
14,"in these cases, management should focus on reducing sediment transport and deposition by means of, e.g., riparian vegetation, in order to regulate sediment flows that are difficult to mitigate at the source."
14,"for example, according to some studies, riparian areas covered by dense and mature forests were ≥75% effective in trapping sediment before reaching a water body in agricultural"
15,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 1864 15 of 22 land [127], and 53% to 96% in piedmont areas [152,153]."
15,"for this purpose, our methodology allows us to locate not only the temporary and secondary channels with a high capacity to transport sediment from the production areas to the wetlands, but also the areas where sediment arrives at the wetlands (table 3)."
15,"however, during high-intensity precipitation events, which are expected to increase in frequency because of climate change [154], the effectiveness of these buffering systems may be limited by the concentration of the surface flow of water and sediment before they even reach the delivery channels [155–157]."
15,"under these circumstances, conservation and restoration of hillside forest in areas of low and medium transport capacity become of paramount importance (table 3): the increase in the roughness of the initialization rills of water and sediment flow can contribute to making it more diffuse, which increases the effectiveness of the riparian filters [158]."
15,"in terms of landscape dynamics, we observed in the study area a widespread and intense forest expansion that can be read as an opportunity to provide erosion regula- tion [159,160]."
15,"our results about forest dynamics were compared to another study in a similar area [87], which provides an average annual forest cover increment rate for the period between 1956 and 2004 of 0.54%, representing an increment of 1.94 ha/year."
15,"if we extrapolate this value to our study area, we get a forest expansion rate of 1342.01 ha/year."
15,"with these data, we estimate that the average area occupied by forests for the year 1983 was 32.01% and 47.53% in 2004, which implies an increment of 2.94 ha/year."
15,"extrapolating these rates to our study area, it represents 2029.58 ha/year."
15,"this reinforced our estimation of future lulc for the year 2049, which is also coherent with the dynamics observed in other mountain regions [111,161,162]."
15,"in the base on these results, the reactivation of secondary succession processes would allow creating, in the next 30 years, a total of 597.01 ha of new forest stands for the study area, which represents a 115% increase compared to the current forest that, in turn, is linked to the erosion regulation and subsequent sediment delivery to the wetlands (see table 3)."
15,"considering these trends, therefore, passive management of forest expansion (i.e., rewilding) seems to be a very cost-effective adaptive strategy for improving wetland conditions and functioning."
15,"apart of that, other restoration tech- niques such as sediment trapping [163] or human-made afforestation could be also applied when erosion effects are more important."
15,"this would assure wetland conditions in case a wetland is close to clogging or receives sediment with a large amount of nutrients [164], or simply when future forests will not be able to reach specific critical locations at the base of our potential simulation [91]."
15,"however, several authors pointed out the negative effects that rewilding may have on preserving the rich diversity of european cultural landscapes [165,166], as well as its impact on traditional agrarian activities and, conse- quently, some food-provisioning es [167]."
15,"in fact, in our study area, forest expansion is driven by a decrease in livestock pressure, which may involve the loss of highly productive grasslands [94]."
15,"in this context, our methodology could contribute to decision-making by identifying areas where the process of secondary succession is most favorable to wetland conservation with minimum area requirements to be managed by nbs implementation (e.g., rewilding)."
15,"furthermore, the framework is suitable to be inserted in integrative approaches that seek to design effective landscapes in response to not only social demands but also environmental conditions of the territory (e.g., blue and green infrastructure networks) [64]."
15,"in this sense, the erosion regulation es for wetland protection would be considered together with other es such as flood regulation, food provision or aesthetic values."
15,"by simultaneously assessing factors associated with wetland conservation such as biodiversity or water body connectivity, and the relationships with other es (e.g., synergies or trade-offs; [167]), the areas of the territory for nbs implementation would be prioritized in a multivariate and cost-effective manner."
15,"conclusions the combination of information about lulc dynamics, wetland distribution and erosion processes has allowed establishing an innovative spatially explicit rs-based work- flow that allows addressing potential ecological and hydrological problems of wetlands in"
16,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 1864 16 of 22 mountainous environments by using nbs related to forest ecosystems."
16,"in the context of this work, ecosystem management actions should be focused on conserving current forest stands and applying passive restoration techniques in areas where future forests could be established near receiving areas where the delivery of sediment from streamflow or surface runoff may reach the aquatic ecosystems of interest."
16,"the general purpose of the stratified approach would tackle not only slowing down erosion processes in the short to long term, but doing so more efficiently, thus ensuring a better ecosystem functionality that could be executed under limited available funding opportunities for ecological restoration."
