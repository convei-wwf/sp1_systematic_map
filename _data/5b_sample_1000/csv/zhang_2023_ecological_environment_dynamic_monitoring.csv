1,abstract: the evaluation and monitoring of the ecological environment quality of heritage sites can help provide sustainable and healthy development strategies for heritage management organizations.
1,"in this study, an ecological evaluation model based on the remote sensing ecological index (rsei) was used to measure the ecological environment of the shibing karst world heritage site and its buffer zone and the moran index and geographic probe model were combined to quantify the ecological environment."
1,"the results show that, (1) from 2013 to 2020, the ecological environment quality of the heritage site and buffer zone was moderate to high and the mean rsei values in the three periods studied were 0.720, 0.723 and 0.742, showing an overall upward and improving trend; (2) ecological environment quality grades of moderate and good accounted for more than 70% of the area, the distribution pattern of ecological environment quality is significantly better at the heritage site than in the buffer zone and the southwest is better than the northeast; (3) the moran index increased from 0.600 in 2013 to 0.661 in 2020, residing in the first and third quadrants, respectively, with significantly spatial aggregation; and (4) greenness and humidity were shown to play a positive feedback role on the ecological environment quality and the spatial influence ability of humidity and dryness was greater."

2,"land 2023, 12, 184 2 of 15 karst is one of the most remarkable landscapes in the world, mainly consisting of spe- cial topography and associated ecosystems developed on carbonate rocks, characterized by vadose flows, caves, dark rivers, canyons, depressions and conical and towering peaks [7]."
2,"china is one of the countries with the most extensive karst distribution in the world, with 1.25 million km2 of carbonate rock outcrops [8] accounting for 13% of the total land area of china."
2,"the “south china karst” is a series of heritage sites, the first phase of which consists of three constituent sites: shilin karst (yunnan), libo karst (guizhou) and wulong karst (chongqing), which were inscribed on the world heritage list in 2007 for meeting world heritage criteria (vii) and (viii) [9]."
2,"the second phase of heritage sites consists of guilin karst (guangxi), shibing karst (guizhou) and jinfo mountain karst (chongqing), which were inscribed on the world heritage list in 2014 for meeting world heritage criteria (vii) and (viii)."
2,"as karst areas are characterized by soil vulnerability, hydrological vulnerability, vegetation vulnerability and human vulnerability [10], it is necessary to monitor them regularly and to protect the sustainability of karst wnhs."
2,"to protect world heritage properties, the world heritage centre developed a program of periodic monitoring reports, conservation status reports, etc., in the 1970s to investigate and track the health of natural world heritage properties [11]."
2,"monitoring is the process of collecting information, analyzing data [12] and subsequently using the information to assess the status, threat factors and severity of resources [13]."
2,"current research applications to monitor ecological quality through integrated survey data by remote sensing [14], psr models [15], urbanization factors [16] and natural succession of the landscape [17] are also common."
2,"however, in the process of monitoring heritage sites, it is important to consider human and financial constraints and to choose an appropriate strategy."
2,"with the development of remote sensing science, multi-source remote sensing technology is frequently applied in the monitoring of wnhs [18], especially the combination of gis and remote sensing technology, which enables researchers and managers of heritage sites to effectively and reliably monitor the ecological environment quality [19,20]."
2,"currently, one method for measuring ecological quality is single-factor change analysis, including analysis of land use change [21,22], npp [23] and eco-efficiency change [24], as well as other factor changes closely related to the ecological environment."
2,"another method is integrated multi-factor change analysis, which is more comprehensive and accurate compared with single-factor analysis, and scholars have proposed various evaluation index systems for this purpose [25,26]."
2,"xu hanqiu et al. [27] proposed a pure remote sensing-driven remote sensing based ecological index (rsei) to reflect the ecological status comprehensively, which was normalized and subjected to principal component analysis from four aspects: greenness ndvi, heat lst, humidity wet and dryness ndisi, to achieve remote sensing ecological status evaluation."
2,"subsequently, several scholars have conducted practical studies in areas such as bayinbrook wnhs and karajun-kurdening wnhs in xinjiang, china [28]."
2,"although this method has been successfully applied in different regions, no remote sensing ecological evaluation study on karst wnhs have been conducted."
2,"as a typical representative of dolomite karst landscapes, this study uses landsat remote sensing images as the data source, explores the characteristics of ecological en- vironment quality changes in the heritage site by constructing a rsei model and using principal component analysis, moran index [29] and geographic probe, further analyzes the driving factors of its ecological environment changes and provides a reference basis for the ecological environmental protection and sustainable development of karst heritage sites."

4,the degree of soil drying is an important factor that affects the ecological environment and is positively related to it [32].
4,"however, in practice, the presence of certain building sites in the area is also an important factor affecting the ecological environment."
4,"therefore, the normalized difference imperviousness and soil index (ndisi) is synthesized using both the bare soil index (si) and the impervious built-up index (ibi)."
4,si + ibi ndisi = (3) 2 ( ρ3 + ρ5 ) − ( ρ1 + ρ4 ) si = (4) ( ρ3 + ρ5 ) + ( ρ1 + ρ4 ) 2ρ5 /(ρ5 + ρ4 ) − [ρ4 /(ρ4 + ρ3 ) + ρ2 /(ρ2 + ρ5 )] ibi = (5) 2ρ5 /(ρ5 + ρ4 ) + [ρ4 /(ρ4 + ρ3 ) + ρ2 /(ρ2 + ρ5 )] heat.
4,land surface temperatures (lst) were calculated using the landsat user manual model [33] and the surface temperature was chosen to represent the heat index.

4,construction of rsei.
4,the above four indicators were standardized in order to facilitate comparisons under the same system and the standardization formula was as follows: ( ii − imin ) n ii = (9) ( imax − imin ) where nii is the index value after the normalization of an image element; ii is the dn value of the index at an image element i; imax is the maximum value of the index; and imin is the minimum value of the index.
4,"the four standardized images were then synthesized and the four indicators were coupled using principal component analysis (pca), a multidimensional data compression technique that selects a few important variables via the orthogonal linear transformation of multiple variables that has the advantages of integrating the weights of each indicator, avoiding human determination and automatically and objectively determining each indica- tor based on the nature of the data themselves and the contribution of each indicator to each principal component."
4,"the following equation was used for the initial rsei calculation: rsei = 1 − pca[ f ( ndv i, wet, ndbsi, lst )] (10) similarly, the calculated rsei values were standardized to obtain the final rsei."

5,"a model consists of four main detectors: the divergence and factor detector, interaction, risk and ecological detector."

7,"together, the four indicators of rsei produce a quantitative signal of response to ecological stressors."
7,the strength of rsei lies not only in its ability to provide a specific area final score but also in its interpretation of the scores of four indica- tors representing specific spatial characteristics of ecological states.

11,data integration of dependent and independent variables was performed before model construction.
11,geographic detectors generally use a grid to represent spatial statistical units.
11,"therefore, in this study, the natural interruption method was used to classify the independent variables into five classes and a 300*300 image element grid was created in the study area to obtain the grid center points as sample points, of which there were 3135 in total."
11,"additionally, the values of the dependent and independent variables in the three periods were factor-probed."
11,"the q value represents the degree of influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable, i.e., the explanatory power of the spatially divergent characteristics of the rsei (table 4)."
11,the results showed that the q-statistics of the factors detected in 2007 were ranked as follows: wet (0.970) > ndisi (0.823) > lucc (0.612) > ndvi (0.418) > lst (0.279) > dem (0.011).
11,the q-statistics in 2016 were ranked as follows: ndisi (0.900) > wet (0.750) > ndvi (0.611) > lucc (0.341) > lst (0.271) > dem (0.033).
11,the q-statistic ranking in 2020 was as follows: wet (0.834) > ndisi (0.798) > lucc (0.655) > lst (0.531) > ndvi (0.364) > dem (0.129).
11,"wet and ndisi have a greater ability to spatially influence the quality of the ecological environment, while elevation has a smaller ability to influence the quality of the ecological environment."
11,3.4.2.
11,"risk detection risk area detection refers to the degree of influence of each factor on rsei at different levels and the results indicate that ndvi and wet positively affect ecological environment quality, indicating that areas with higher vegetation cover and higher humidity have a greater influence on the ecological environment quality."
11,"additionally, ndisi and lst have a negative feedback effect on the ecological environment quality, indicating that the higher the dryness value and the higher the surface temperature, the higher the ecological pressure and the poorer the area’s quality."
11,"the risk area detection of land use shows that shrubs, grasslands, water bodies and woodlands play a positive feedback role in ecological quality and building land plays a negative feedback role."
11,altitude-specific risk zone detection shows that areas at sufficiently high or low elevations negatively affect ecological quality.
11,"conversely, areas at intermediate elevations have a positive feedback effect."
11,discussion there are numerous methods for monitoring and evaluating the ecological environ- ment quality.
11,"li hailong et al. established an urban evaluation index system from five target layers: resource conservation, environmental friendliness, economic sustainability, social harmony, economic sustainability and social harmony [37]; peng tao et al. established an ecological evaluation system for coastal wetlands including 17 specific indicators such as population density, degree of eutrophication of water bodies, biodiversity and awareness of wetland protection [38]."
11,"in recent years, national and regional government agencies have also established some ecological evaluation index systems, such as the ecological environment status index (ei) proposed by the chinese ministry of environmental pro- tection in 2006."
11,remote sensing images are used to select indicators as well as to evaluate the ecological environment quality of heritage sites so as to visualize and analyze them spatially.
11,"with the development of remote sensing data, the development of large-scale remote sensing satellites, medium-scale uav monitoring and small-scale ground moni- toring stations provides a multi-scale, multi-data source approach for the monitoring of the ecological environment quality of heritage sites."
11,"many scholars also obtained spatial data of ecological environment in cities, economic circles and mining areas by remote sensing technology, selected indicators of natural environmental conditions, environmental quality, natural landscape pattern and urbanization impact and assimilated environmental"
12,"land 2023, 12, 184 12 of 15 pollution monitoring data and socioeconomic statistics by using gis spatial analysis tech- nology to make a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological environment status [39–41]."
12,"currently, the rsei is mainly applied to the evaluation of ecological environment quality in urban and mining areas."
12,there are fewer applications in karst areas.
12,"it is challenging to apply rsei to monitor and evaluate the ecological quality of karst areas with a fragile ecological background, unique hydrogeological dichotomy development and particularly contradictory human-land relationship."
12,"in this study, the monitoring and evaluation of the ecological environment quality of shibing karst wnhs was carried out using the rsei index model, the indicators of heat, humidity, dryness and greenness were selected as evaluation indicators and the weight was determined by the contribution rate of each indicator to the first principal component, which was found to be above 80% by measurement."
12,this indicates that pc1 concentrates most of the information of the four indicators.
12,the selection of indicators and the determination of weights are more reasonable.
12,"an analysis of table 4 reveals that the greenness index and humidity index are the preferred factors affecting the ecological environment quality of the heritage site, which is strongly related to the vegetation cover and precipitation of the shibing karst wnhs and increases in temperature and precipitation are favorable to the growth of vegetation."
12,this finding is also consistent with the relevant studies of wangguo-qing et al. [42] and chen-juan et al.
12,"in this paper, satellite images were used to invert surface temperature instead of air temperature and humidity to represent precipitation, which were used to analyze the effects of changes in air temperature and precipitation on ecological environment quality."
12,"the shibing karst has the properties of a wnhs and a scenic area for conservation and heritage display as one of the important functions [44] and is mainly concentrated in the heritage showcase area, including the sugimu river and yuntai mountain scenic areas in the southern part of the nominated site."
12,"the ecological environment in this area is well maintained, the geological and geomorphological features are outstanding, the science and research development is in its early stages and the conditions for carrying out science and education tourism are relatively mature."
12,"as shibing belongs to a karst region, its fragile ecological environment is vulnerable to the natural environment and human activities."
12,"however, this study reveals that since the listing of shibing karst as a world heritage site, the heritage management departments at all levels of government have protected and managed the site in accordance with the law and the local aboriginal village rules and regulations and the ecological quality of the site has been well preserved, in line with the sustainable heritage tourism advocated by unesco."
12,karst is mainly composed of a special topography developed in carbonate rocks and related ecosystems [45].
12,"in this study, lithological data were not used as the main evaluation index due to the high vegetation cover in the shibing karst wnhs and the surface morphology of the peak canyon and peak valley in the shibing karst wnhs and thus elevation was used as an important index to study its spatial differentiation."
12,"in this paper, we considered that there are only a few human activities in the heritage site, all of them are at the junction of the heritage site and the buffer zone and most of them involve tourists and tourism employees, because the study year was 2020, the development of the tourism industry was suspended due to the impact of the covid-19 epidemic and thus the population and economic data were not used as evaluation indexes [46]."
12,"unlike other regions, there is not only surface loss but also subsurface leakage of soil and water in karst areas [47]."
12,"therefore, in the future environmental monitoring of the karst world natural heritage, we should focus on the above-ground and below-ground monitoring in the field, in order to protect the ecological environment of the heritage sites more comprehensively."
12,remote sensing images were used to select indicators as well as to evaluate the ecological and environmental quality of heritage sites so as to visualize and analyze them spatially.
12,"with the development of remote sensing data, large-scale remote sensing satellites, medium-scale uav monitoring and small-scale ground monitoring stations have been developed to provide a multi-scale, multi-data source approach to monitoring the ecological and environmental quality of"
13,"land 2023, 12, 184 13 of 15 heritage sites."
13,"in future ecological environment quality monitoring, full consideration should be given to uav monitoring as well as ground monitoring stations to give full play to the synergy of sky–ground integration [48,49] and provide effective solutions for the conservation and sustainable development of wnhs."
13,"conclusions the proposed method for karst-like heritage sites using rsei and the geo-detector model, combined with gis spatial analysis and statistical methods, provides a quantifiable and visualized method with large temporal and spatial scales for assessing and monitoring the ecological environment quality, which can be used for monitoring the ecological envi- ronment quality of wnhs, especially karst-like wnhs with a more fragile ecology."
13,"the evaluation of ecological environment quality is important for the management, conserva- tion and sustainable development of heritage sites."
13,"this study uses remote sensing data and geospatial analysis methods to evaluate the ecological environment quality of karst heritage sites, taking the pre-application, post-application and current conditions of the heritage sites as the temporal research scale."
13,"the study found that: (1) in the evaluation of the ecological environment quality of the three phases of the karst heritage site in shibing, the contribution of the pc1 principal component eigenvalues reached more than 80% and the rsei was applicable to the ecological environment quality assessment of the karst wnhs."
13,"(2) the proportion of the areas with good and excellent ecological quality rose from 88.24% in 2013 to 91.82% in 2020, while the proportion of areas with poor rsei grades de- clined period by period, from 1.15% in 2013 to 0.04% in 2020, showing a significant decline."
13,(3) the ecological environment quality shows a positive spatial correlation and the moran index value is steadily increasing.
13,"the ecological environment quality has significant spatial aggregation characteristics, generally showing that the west side of the heritage site is more aggregated than the east side of the heritage site."
13,the high–high aggregation is mainly distributed in the heritage site and low–low aggregation is mainly distributed in the buffer zone.
13,(4) the results based on the geo-detectors model show that wet and ndisi have greater explanatory power for the spatially divergent features of ecological environmental quality in single-factor detection and are the dominant factors of environmental quality in shibing wnhs.
13,ndvi and wet were found to play a positive feedback role in ecological environmental quality in terms of risk area detection and ndisi and lst play a negative feedback role in terms of ecological environmental quality.
