1,with great opportunity comes great challenges regarding efficient and effective data management clustering property because earth observation data is of different scales and characterized by complexity in spatial relationships data management related to the real world.
1,"to overcome the challenges is crucial for, for instance, data mining, land surveying, big earth observation data and especially emergency mapping for disaster response."
1,"to improve the querying efficiency of big earth ob- spatial indexing and querying servation data, we proposed a novel data management approach: global multi-scale grid integer coding and spatial indexing."
1,"among our contributions are: (1) proposing global multi-scale grid integer coding model (gmgicm), which presents clustering property in both the scale dimension and spatial dimension, and theo- retically facilitates an efficient querying; (2) deliberately applying gmgicm on multi-scale earth observation data spatial indexing, which results in one-dimensional data index, which can be queried using simple b-tree, inversion, and other one-dimensional indexes; (3) designing a strategy to assure the completeness of spatial querying, which is not well solved by existing grid-based coding models."
1,"the advantages of our proposed ap- proach have been demonstrated with both simulated and real remote sensing data, with spatial operation 20 times as fast as geohash and spatial querying 10 times as fast as oracle spatial on average."
1,the proposed approach can be easily adapted for three or higher-dimensional earth observation data and bring potential benefit to all big earth observation data analytic projects.

2,"in this but does not consider whether the target area is included by a candidate case, it is difficult to retrieve, integrate and share eo data in the same grid."

2,"in addition, the which a spatial indexing and querying approach is designed for big eo generation of the pyramid images, will not only produce lots of data data of different scales (section 3)."
2,"the core design of our approach is to tiles, resulting in much demand of data storage space (yin et al., 2017); relate eo data to the proposed integer code with three reasonable re- but also raise up the time consumption of data preprocessing."

2,multi-scale grid subdividing and coding methods image retrieving and spatial querying can be performed on basis of the encoded grid index.
2,"for instance, researchers have employed grid index the proposed global multi-scale grid integer coding model based on linear quadtree for global remote sensing data subdivision (gmgicm) mainly includes multi-scale grid subdividing and coding organization (song et al.,2014), proposed a multi-level grid model for methods."
2,"the grid subdividing method of gmgicm is based on quad- massive remote sensing data storage and management (li, et al., 2016), tree and longitude-latitude grid subdivision (hartmann et al., 2016), as studied query evaluations over multi-dimensional geospatial datasets is shown in fig."
2,"considering that longitude-latitude grids are not (malensek et al., 2017), investigated the retrieval strategy for massive symmetrical and quad-tree requires symmetry in both directions, the remote sensing metadata based on geohash coding (huang and wang, north–south extent (latitude direction) of the earth surface is extended 2018), and proposed a geographic meshing and coding method based from latitude 90° and latitude −90° to latitude 180° and latitude on adaptive hilbert-geohash (guo et al., 2019)."

2,take the commonly used dimension.
2,"geohash (moussalli et al., 2015; malensek et al., 2017) and world geodetic system 1984 (wgs-84) as an example, the first level, geosot (lin et al., 2015; li, et al., 2016) are both based on quad-tree level 0, consisting only one grid centered in (0°, 0°), represents the grid model, which recursively divides the space into sub-space of whole sphere."
2,"by partitioning the grid into four sub-grids, we can ob- multiple levels, and they use space filling curve and level of grids to tain the second level, level 1, consisting four grids, each of them re- encode multi-scale grids."
2,this kind of coding methods is of good spatial presenting 1/4 of the whole sphere.
2,"similarly, level 2, consisting of 16 locality within the same level of sub-space, but not across different grids, represents 1/8 of the whole surface."
2,"following this method, level levels, which causes bad continuity of space filling curve in multi-scale 31 represents 1/8 × 1/429 of the whole surface, corresponding to 45°/ grid model, i.e., the spatial relationships of the encoded grids are 429 × 45°/429 area, which is 1.86 cm × 1.86 cm at the earth’s equator missing, meanwhile, hinders the operational efficiency of the coded when the earth radius is 6378.140 km."
2,"this 31th level is sufficient for index. the position accuracy of all state-of-the-art satellite images (zhong secondly, linear tree-based indexing does not support data with et al., 2018). complex spatial relationships well (jensen et al., 2006)."
2,it is suitable for the multi-scale grid coding method of gmgicm employs a m-bit managing grid codes of different scales.
2,"however, it is more appropriate unsigned integer to uniformly identify each grid at each level, where for point objects at a specified grid level (davis et al., 2018), instead of the integer is a gmgicm code."

2,"this is because it only directions in fig. 1 can use 31 bits, and the left two bits is to identify the uses the leaf node for management, not the root nodes or intermediate levels. child nodes."
2,"this leads to its limitation of being used in structuring big the encoding and decoding methods of gmgicm codes in 31th level eo data.

3,"given a gmgicm code mc , its level n can be determined by: using the cross-bit method (griffiths, 1986), and codes for hilbert curve are usually mapping transformed form z-curve codes, or calculated (1) if mc is an even number, i.e., mc&1 = 0 , then n = 31; using recursive algorithms (liu and schrack, 1996)."

11,"additionally, it is stable this paper provides significant solutions for existing challenges for and not susceptible to the shape and size of querying areas."
11,"for oracle big eo data management, and is supportive for effective and accurate spatial, by contrast, the more complex the shape of the querying region, services related to eo data such as data sharing."

11,"this is because oracle spatial tioned that methods in this study have been successfully applied in one is mainly based on vector and floating-point calculations, which is satellite data center in china, whose management system has been much more un-efficient than grid and integer calculations."
11,"it needs to upgraded with this proposed low-cost, feasible and efficient solution. mention that the querying accuracy is a little lower when using the future work includes further improving the querying accuracy and proposed method than oracle spatial."
11,this is due to the precision loss extending this work for spatial–temporal big data by exploiting spa- tial–temporal index mechanism.
