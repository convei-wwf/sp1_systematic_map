7,this is consistent with the fact that the estimated temperatures exhibited smaller mean errors with respect to the true ones in the cases of “lst-avhrr-mesonet” (mean error below 0.1 k) and “sst” (mean error below 0.2 k) than in the case of “lst-msg-arsia” (mean error around 0.7 k).
7,"similarly, the intercepts of the linear regression of the estimated temperatures with respect to the true ones were larger with “lst-msg-arsia” than with “lst-avhrr-mesonet” and “sst.”"
7,this is interpreted as a consequence of the lower correlation of the satellite infrared observations with the in situ even smaller differences can be noted between the regression measurements for “lst-msg-arsia.”
