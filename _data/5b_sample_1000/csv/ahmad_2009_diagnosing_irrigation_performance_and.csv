1,"a principle benefit of surface energy balance the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural perfor- mance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner."
1,"to demonstrate the advantages, the approach was applied in rechna doab irrigation system of pakistan’s punjab province."
