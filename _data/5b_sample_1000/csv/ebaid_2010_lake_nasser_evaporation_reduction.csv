1,"this evaluation inte- landsat; grates remote sensing, geographic information system (gis) techniques, aerodynamic principles, gis; and landsat7 etm+ images."
1,"three main procedures were carried out in this study; the ﬁrst evaporation; derived the surface temperature from landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth lake nasser and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantiﬁed evaporation loss to the sec- ondary channels’ level over one month (march) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface tem- perature of the raster data; the third procedure applied gis suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected."
1,the results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2.73 mm/day at the middle of the lake to 9.58 mm/day at the edge.
1,the evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0.86 billion m3/month (march).
1,"the analysis suggests that it is possible to save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19.7 million m3/ month (march), and thus 2.4 billion m3/year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate con- struction heights of 8 m and 15 m."
1,"in conclusion, remote sensing and gis are useful for applications in remote locations where ﬁeld-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management. ª 2010 cairo university."

5,evaporation depth in mm/day reached maximum values near secondary channels due to proximity to land where the temperature is higher.
5,"fig. 6 shows evaporation depth values, which ranged approximately from 5 to 10 at secondary chan- nels locations, and from 2 to 5 at the middle of the lake."
5,"from the previous analysis, it was clear that there is a strong correlation (r2 = 0.98, coefﬁcient of determination) between surface temperature in c and evaporation depth in mm/day."
5,"also, it is possible to reduce evaporation loss and conse- quently save some of the lake’s water by disconnecting some of the secondary channels (khors) where the evapora- tion losses are higher."
