1,one approach to improving the efﬁcacy of natural forest conservation received in revised form 19 january 2014 efforts is to reﬁne local forest conservation policies based on insights from the place-based study of accepted 26 january 2014 conservation policies and land-use and land-cover change (lulc) dynamics.
1,"to demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of lulc and conservation policies on the forest frontier of madre de dios, peru."
1,"the main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efﬁcacy of keywords: designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conservation land conﬂict ecosystem conversion of granting conﬂicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation additionality conservation areas."
1,"using statistical matching and a gis-based analysis of lulc, this research shows that matching for the period 2006–2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of madre de dios remote sensing signiﬁcantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly frontier variable across conservation designations."
1,"also, when present, conﬂicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, speciﬁcally overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation."
1,this ﬁnding demonstrates that authorizing conﬂicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes.
1,"this case study also provides examples of how local forest conservation policies can be improved through detailed and frequent analyses of lulc and conservation policies, particularly in dynamic frontier landscapes where lulc and socio-economic conditions are rapidly changing."

2,"since the discovery of gold, an estimated 30,000 artisanal rights within conservation areas suggests that conservation miners have migrated to madre de dios (webster, 2012)."
2,it is outcomes should be sensitive to the inﬂuence of conﬂicting land- thought that 95% of gold mining operations in the region are use authorizations.
2,"in the amazon region alone, many large-scale illegal because the miners either lack the proper permits to run and conﬂicting land-use authorizations have already been imple- their operations or because they are working outside authorized mented on designated conservation lands."

2,"at the same time, 94% of the study and management of forests globally, this research examines this area was covered by natural ecosystems, including mature lowland issue locally in madre de dios, peru."
2,"in madre de dios, various rainforests, which comprised 69% of existing natural ecosystems, affected land users have already identiﬁed overlapping land desig- followed by montane forests, which were the second most abun- nations as problematic."

4,"the ﬁnal matching and the inﬂuence of conﬂicting land authorizations on the efﬁcacy analysis included seven spatially explicit variables that were of designated conservation areas, statistical matching was used collinear with regional ecosystem conversion from 2006 to 2011 (ho et al., 2007; ferraro, 2009)."
4,matching is a robust statistical (appendix a).
4,"all the covariates created and tested in the data approach that can be used to assess the additionality of conserva- creation process were independently correlated with regional tion designations because it provides an unbiased estimate of the ecosystem conversion and thus included in the ﬁnal matching treatment effect of land designation policies and allows for the analyses. user to control for the nonrandom distribution of designated the covariate variables used in this study were developed from conservation areas (alix-garcia et al., 2008; joppa and pfaff, a spatially explicit dataset created from a variety of sources, 2010), which is particularly important given the tendency of including public agencies in peru and the united states (see protected areas to be located in more remote locations with lower table 2)."
4,"most of the variables representing land-use designations risks of ecosystem loss (pfaff et al., 2009; joppa and pfaff, 2009). were current in the year 2011 and thus may contain an incomplete matching works in practice by using software to combine random record of land-use distribution in the year 2006."
4,"the effect of this samples of treatment and control variables into matched pairs to time lag in available data is unknown, but likely to be minimal undertake an ‘‘apples-to-apples’’ comparison of their differential due to the low number of major changes in land-use designation outcomes."
4,this comparison is then used to estimate the treatment 2006–2011.
4,"also, due to the high level of land-use overlap in the effect of the policy intervention (joppa and pfaff, 2011; blackman, study area, a caveat of this research is that some pixels used in 2013). the matching analyses were assigned several land-use classes."
4,"to account for other factors that drive conservation outcomes however, the potential inﬂuence on the matching analyses of dual besides the policy treatment, such as distance to major roads and land-use classiﬁcations for the same pixel is likely to be low due to population centers, pixel pairs are matched based on all observed the matching sampling design and the speciﬁc analyses under- covariates of ecosystem loss."

8,"unraveling the reasons for this shift is difﬁcult with this conservation strategies requires the intelligent combination of study design, but the reasons likely rest on the relative economic mutually supporting conservation and development policies returns of gold mining compared to agriculture."

8,"given the high wage disparity between gold juan obesso, chris kirkby, bethzabe guevara, yadira cipriani, miners and low skilled labors outside the mining industry, it is antonio velazco, samantha zwicker, miles logsdon, daniel vogt, likely that the higher wages and proﬁts earned by gold mining amanda rasmussen, bethany drahota, morgan hoenig, sam was a major factor driving the shift in lulc dynamics from agricul- scullion, and the nonproﬁt organizations the amazon conservation ture to mining."
