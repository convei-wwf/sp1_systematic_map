2,today’s extended fire seasons and large fire footprints have prompted state and federal land management agencies to devote increasingly larger portions of their budgets to wildfire management.
2,"as fire costs continue to rise, timely and comprehensive fire information becomes increasingly critical to response and rehabilitation efforts."
2,the nasa rehabilitation capability convergence for ecosystem recovery (recover) post-fire decision support system is a server-based application designed to rapidly provide land managers with the information needed to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan.
2,this study evaluated the efficacy of recover through structured interviews with land managers (n=19) who used recover and were responsible for post-fire rehabilitation efforts on over 715 000 ha of fire-affected lands.
2,"although the benefit of better-informed decisions is difficult to quantify, the results of this study illustrate that recover’s decision support capabilities provided information to land managers that either validated or altered their decisions on post-fire treatments estimated at over $1.2 million (usd) and saved nearly 800 hours of staff time by streamlining data collection as well as communication with local stakeholders and partnering agencies."
2,brief summary.
2,the nasa rehabilitation capability convergence for ecosystem recovery (recover) post-fire decision support system is designed to rapidly assist land managers with developing a rehabilitation plan.
2,"through structured interviews with land managers using recover, this study revealed a significant cost- and time- savings to these agencies."
2,these benefits rest in streamlining data collection and improving cross-organizational communication.
2,"additional keywords: communication, planning, remote sensing, decision support 1"
3,"use and benefits of nasa’s recover introduction after a large fire is contained, land managers often assess post-fire conditions and develop a stabilization and rehabilitation plan."
3,"due to regulatory time constraints, land managers are tasked with rapid data assembly, analysis, and decision making (robichaud et al."
3,2009).
3,"currently, information used for post-fire planning may be limited by the availability of staff time, funding, or consistent and site specific data for a given fire (dombeck et al."
3,2003; schnase et al.
3,2014).
3,this lack of information or quality data may result in key knowledge gaps hindering post-fire planning efforts (venn and calkin 2008; thompson and calkin 2011).
3,"given the potential importance of post-fire stabilization and rehabilitation for ecosystem recovery, rapidly acquiring critical data such as fire severity or debris-flow probability becomes essential for the decision making process (venn and calkin 2008; robichaud 2009; curth et al."
3,2012; schnase et al.
3,2014).
3,although there is a wide variety of geospatial tools designed to support post-fire decision making– i.e.
3,usgs debris flow modeling (staley et al.
3,"2016), rapid response erosion database (miller et al. 2016), and usda forest service tools (lew et al. 2017) – none comprehensively address the need of stabilization and rehabilitation planning (calkin et al."
3,2011; schnase et al.
3,2014).
3,"through the rapid collection and deployment of the actionable information needed to submitting a rehabilitation plan, access to fire-specific geospatial data can reduce uncertainty in the post-fire planning environment, facilitating better-informed decisions that may reduce direct and indirect costs (macauley 2006; kangas et al."
3,2010).
3,these better-informed decisions are not only beneficial to the individual or agency tasked with post-fire rehabilitation but also to community members impacted in a variety of ways (wigtil et al.
3,2016).
3,"to help illustrate the potential societal value of geospatial tools and earth observing satellite imagery, this research used the nasa rehabilitation capability convergence for ecosystem recovery (recover) post-fire decision support system (dss) as a case study."
3,"through semi-structured stakeholder interviews, this project sought to identify the actual impact of rapid assembly and deployment of geospatial data in wildfire emergency response planning in order to assess the value of information derived from recover’s geospatial data layers (n=26) and how these data influence and improve post-fire decision making."
3,"these data layers include roads, hydrography, soils, critical habitat, past fires, land cover, and topography."
3,an analysis of the value of information derived from recover provided a rich contextual comparison to those decisions made in the absence of geospatial tools.
3,this approach also assisted in determining a monetary value for the immediate outcomes of land managers’ better- informed decisions enabled by recover-based data.
3,"in addition, we hoped these interviews would highlight any time- and cost-savings for decision makers and support staff who utilized recover, which are expressed later as approximate dollars saved."
3,"finally, although more difficult to quantify, the ultimate social benefits of better-informed decisions – i.e. impacts on the ecosystem, recreation, and land use – are also considered in the final estimation of recover’s overall socioeconomic impact in the post-fire emergency response planning process."
3,background recover decision support system the recover dss is made up of a recover server and a recover client.
3,the recover server is highly automated using python scripting within the arcgis platform (esri 2018).
3,the recover client is a full-featured web map/gis analysis environment.
3,"when provided a wildfire name and geospatial extent, the recover server aggregates site-specific 2"
4,use and benefits of nasa’s recover data residing on the server and exposes it to the recover client through web services.
4,recover reduces the time required to assemble and deliver crucial post-fire related data from days to minutes (schnase et al.
4,2014).
4,"recover’s purpose according to agency partners – primarily the idaho department of lands, forest service (usfs), and bureau of land management (blm), prior to recover, data assembly was the most significant bottleneck in post-fire related decision making (schnase et al."
4,2014).
4,"after a major wildfire event, federal land management agencies are required to develop and certify a comprehensive plan for public safety, burned area stabilization, resource protection, and site recovery within 21 days of fire containment (usfws 2001)."
4,"initial rehabilitation plans, however, must be submitted within one week of when the fire was contained, which places a substantial burden on the agencies’ resources, mainly staff time and availability, to collect and synthesize the necessary data for the decision making process."
4,"recover benefits the land manager by providing the manager with actionable information very quickly and providing him/her with additional post-fire data describing the event (e.g., fire severity (dnbr)), identifying areas in need of reseeding or other post-fire treatment, and monitoring subsequent ecosystem recovery in response to prescribed treatments (schnase et al."
4,2014).
4,"given the potential importance of reseeding after a significant fire event – i.e. to stabilize hydrophobic soils in order to minimize the probability of a debris-flow or to restore wildlife habitat and livestock rangeland to productive levels – recover’s features can significantly reduce the costs associated with assessment and planning phases, as well as better improve the land through rapid and accurate assessments of the effects of a fire event."
4,"during the early phases of recover’s development, efforts were taken to develop system requirements that accounted for the actual decision making process of the land manager in response to a fire event."
4,"through the rapid acquisition of data, one of the objectives of recover was to allow fire managers to shift their attention to more important and potentially impactful tasks of analysis, planning, and monitoring (schnase et al."
4,2014).
4,"since the 2013 fire season, recover has been called upon to provide web maps for 60 wildland fires in seven states (table 1) and has supported and improved the work and decision making of sixteen different state and federal agencies throughout the western united states."
4,"methodology interview process nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with personnel from federal, state, and local agencies, representing a wide range of job functions and responsibilities, who had used recover as part of their duties."
4,"these nineteen participants represent 78% (n=47) of the fires mapped by recover, an area covering over 715 000 ha."
4,"through the semi-structured interviews we sought to acquire insight into how recover was being used, which features were thought to be most beneficial, whether uncertainty in the post-fire decision making process was reduced, and whether the individual or agency intended to adopt the tool (table 2)."
4,"further, we requested the participants attempt to quantify the total staff time or dollars saved, as well as to highlight specific instances where recover data enabled the user to make a better-informed decision that either prevented or validated a potentially expensive rehabilitation treatment."
4,"although attempting to quantify the indirect benefits of recover proved a difficult task, 3"
5,"use and benefits of nasa’s recover several respondents provided data that could be aggregated and analyzed for trends, which helped assess the economic value of recover’s use."
5,"calculations the participants’ responses to questions about the value of information provided and whether staff time and related expenses were saved by using recover were not easily quantifiable, because, to our knowledge, there are no universally accepted approaches."
5,"therefore, we took the following approach."
5,"where respondents gave ambiguous answers or rough estimates – i.e. “several days,” “ten to twelve staff,” and “a few hours” – we took the liberty of assigning values to these responses."
5,"where public records were available, we used the actual hourly wage reported for the previous fiscal year (fy 2016-17) of the participants who provided measurable data and when public records were unavailable we used the 2016 us general schedule (gs) pay rates for mid-level federal employees."
5,findings several recurring themes and trends consistently emerged throughout the interviews that strongly indicated the use of recover played a critical role for land management personnel and agencies in their post-fire rehabilitation efforts.
5,"all nineteen respondents, regardless of actual level of use, initially sought to employ recover for a variety of duties and objectives."
5,"for instance, attaining data and information on burn severity, debris-flow probability, and pre-fire vegetative cover were the most common responses (n=14)."
5,"land managers finding these specific web maps to be of value is not surprising as land rehabilitation and recovery is their primary concern, and these web maps directly address the health and status of the affected ecosystem."
5,"further, 94% (n=18) of the interviewees reported they plan to use recover in future fire seasons, potentially highlighting recover’s usability and perceived effectiveness assisting in the post-fire decision making."
5,"assistance in reducing uncertainty as recover was designed to support the development of blm’s emergency stabilization and rehabilitation (es&r) plans and usfs baer plans, ascertaining whether its use actually reduced uncertainty in core areas of rehabilitation planning was crucial."
5,"over 30% (n=6) of respondents reported they were able to mitigate some sort of post-fire hazard, like a debris-flow, by utilizing in a timely manner recover’s web maps."
5,"quantifying the ultimate benefit of avoiding a post-fire hazard like a debris-flow is difficult because of the unique circumstances of each wildfire, but the occurrence of such an event can easily have catastrophic social and economic repercussions totaling in the millions of dollars (usd) (de graff, 2014)."
5,"furthermore, over 36% (n=7) of users agreed that recover assisted with the overall planning of reseeding efforts and 63% (n=12) relied on recover to help determine burn severity."
5,reducing uncertainty in these areas has the potential to save the agency costs and increase the effectiveness of their ecosystem stabilization and rehabilitation efforts.
5,"finally, over 30% (n=6) of users reported that recover significantly improved their ability to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan."
5,"without recover, these land managers would have likely had to rely exclusively on field observations and invested significant agency resources over several days to acquire the data necessary to submit their plan."
6,"use and benefits of nasa’s recover staff time and related costs saved based on our interviews, twelve participants stated that recover had saved their agencies a cumulative 800 hours of staff time, or roughly $43 000 (usd), of data collection expenses related to the rehabilitation plans."
6,"similarly, 63% (n=12) of users stated recover improved overall communications by providing comprehensive and reliable maps automatically."
6,twenty- six percent (n=5) recorded improvements within the agency and 52% (n=10) with partnering agencies as well as with the public.
6,"improved communication between partnering agencies is particularly important because wildfires typically expand into multiple jurisdictions – i.e. federal, state, and private – where several different landowners may be affected."
6,cooperation and information sharing among the affected landowners will benefit the lead agency responsible for the rehabilitation planning as well as the primary users of the land.
6,"in total, participants determined approximately $2 000 (usd) of staff time were saved using recover for communications instead of previous methods."
6,better-informed decisions almost eighty percent (n=15) of recover users reported the information recover provided helped personnel make better-informed decisions that both directly and indirectly affected the roughly 715 000 ha of land they managed or monitored.
6,three users attempted to place a monetary value on the benefits of recover’s use and value of information by citing approximate staff time savings and immediate outcomes enabled by recover.
6,one participant stated they had requested recover’s debris-flow probability feature before finalizing a $500 000 (usd) wood mulch aerial application.
6,"after analyzing recover’s data with the results from the field observation assessment, they determined the probability of a debris-flow event occurring was minimal and no longer justified the expense, thus saving $500 000 (usd)."
6,"a second interviewee explained the value of information provided by recover would have taken several support staff working an entire week, or 280 hours, an expense we estimate at $15 814 (usd), to gather all of the data recover can rapidly deliver in a matter of minutes."
6,a third participant discussed how recover was used to validate a $700 000 (usd) wood mulch application treatment and confirm the accuracy of field observation assessments.
6,"in all, the actionable data and information recover supported decisions that had a minimum economic value of over $1.2 million (usd) to its users."
6,"discussion and conclusion the sample of interviewees, although relatively small, represents a substantial number of the larger fires that occurred in the targeted states and a majority of land managers who used recover."
6,"these participants were responsible for over 715 000 ha of fire-affected land, including the subsequent post-fire planning and rehabilitation to ensure ecosystem recovery."
6,participants reported recover’s rapidly assembled and site-specific data provided key decision-makers with the information needed to identify sites that had the greatest potential for negatively impacting the fire affected area and helped them determine appropriate treatment plans.
6,this rapid acquisition of data may also benefit the public by allowing land managers more time to focus their attention on more important aspects of the rehabilitation and recovery process.
6,"due to the tight time constraint on reporting and the competition for funding these agencies face, recover’s ability to reduce data collection time by hundreds of hours per fire makes it a valuable and cost-effective tool for adoption by land management agencies."
7,use and benefits of nasa’s recover recover’s greatest potential benefit arises from the better-informed decisions it enables.
7,recover allows land managers to effectively identify areas of high risk and determine more efficient treatments or management strategies that will restore or improve the land.
7,"by providing critical data quickly, land managers can complete thorough analyses in time to meet critical deadlines."
7,"without this ability, land management agencies run the risk of recommending unnecessary and expensive treatment strategies, or foregoing a much needed rehabilitation technique."
7,"these results illustrate a significant social and economic value for land management agencies, as well as for the land and land users, in using recover and other geospatial data to assist in post-fire rehabilitation planning."
7,"although much of the added value is found in improved communication and decision making by recover users, a significant portion arises from staff time and cost savings from the reduction of data collection duties."
7,"in total, recover saved 788.75 hours of staff time and had a minimum positive economic impact of $1.2 million (usd) on land management agencies."
