1,an accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface flood inundation mapping water distribution.
1,"in this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm landsat 8 operational land imager (oli) optimization (smdpso) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in landsat 8 operational land imager surface water extraction (oli) images."
1,"only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered."
1,these parameters are suﬃciently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for diﬀerent conditions.
1,"by contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions."
1,"eight test sites covering various water types in diﬀerent climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (oa), kappa coeﬃcients (kc), commission error (ce) and omission error (oe)."
1,"the results show that: (1) smdpso achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) smdpso has lower oe but higher ce than the supervised method, which means that smdpso is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) smdpso has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as dem."
1,"in addition, a case of ﬂooding in north- eastern china is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of smdpso in water inundation mapping."
1,"the ﬁndings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisﬁes the require- ments of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management."

1,"the social, economic and ecological responses to surface water inundation have been studied in recent literature (marton and kapelan, terrestrial water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds, puddles and 2014; tang et al., 2016; ten brinke et al., 2017; zhang et al., 2017), artiﬁcial reservoirs play important roles in inland water cycles and providing guidance for government oﬃcials and decision-makers in ecosystem balance and provide essential resources for animals and policy and management. vegetation."

2,"this paper continues the research (yang of landsat tm to compute the ndwi to reduce signature variability in et al., 2015; pekel et al., 2016) on water-speciﬁc classiﬁcation and unmixed coastal marshes."
2,"because of the inﬂuence of built-up land, proposes a new water extraction method called spectrum matching vegetation and soil, xu (2006) used bands 2 (green) and 5 (mir) of based on discrete particle swarm optimization (smdpso)."

17,seasonal melt land is characterized by ice or snow that covers the land in winter and melts into water in spring.

17,"for 2016; sheng et al., 2016)."
17,"another important step is to reconstruct and example, if landsat 5 and landsat 7 are suitable, all landsat images analyze time series data."
17,"various water types (e.g., permanent water, with continuous time series (wulder et al., 2016) over decades can be seasonal water and inundated areas) must be identiﬁed and noise, such used to reconstruct water inundation frequencies from the 1980s to the as from cloud shadows cast on the surface, which are diﬃcult to handle present."
17,"sentinel-2 has similar spectral and spatial characteristics as in the spatial domain, must be removed."
17,"time series analysis in the time those of landsat 8 (storey et al., 2016), and their combined datasets domain is an alternative method to reduce noise, but some important provide more frequent temporal observations globally."
17,"some previous information, such data from extreme events (e.g., ﬂoods), is lost in the studies (zhu et al., 2015; novelli et al., 2016) have been conducted with process. a combination of landsat series and sentinel-2 images."
