1,suspended particulate matter (spm) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management.
1,"in-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering spm variability are yet to be understood."
1,this study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data.
1,"turbidity and spm of the agoufou lake in sahelian mali were measured from october 2014 to present, providing a large range of ‘values (spm ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/l)."
1,"these data are compared to satellite reflectance from landsat (etm+, oli) and modis (mod09gq, myd09gq)."
1,"for each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and spm, up to very high values (r2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies."
1,the satellite estimates are then employed to assess the spm dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors.
1,the main spm seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (june to september) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport.
1,"a second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of spm."
1,"three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when spm decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in january-march; and lastly, an spm deposition period in april–may, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind."
1,"overall, a significant increase of 27% in spm values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the agoufou lake."
1,the significant spatio-temporal variability in spm revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.
1,keywords: spm; turbidity; surface water; remote sensing; west africa highlights: • extremely high and varying amounts of suspended particulate matter found in sahelian ponds and lakes.
1,• the near infrared band is well suited to retrieve suspended particulate matter and turbidity from both modis and landsat.
1,• an important increase in suspended particulate matter due to resuspension mechanisms is driven by wind in the dry season.

2,"remote sens. 2017, 9, 1272 2 of 22 • a significant upward trend in suspended particulate matter is found for the agoufou lake between 2000 and 2016."
2,"introduction over the past 50 years, the sahel has undergone significant climatic and hydrological changes."
2,"among them, the “sahelian paradox” refers to the observed increase in surface runoff in a context of reduced rainfall that started in the 1970s ([1–3] among others)."
2,"indeed, the sahel drought, being the longest multi-decadal drought of the 20th century, had the unexpected consequence of more water ending up in rivers and ponds, and even in some water tables, as a result of increased preferential infiltration in ponds and gullies."
2,"the first observations of this phenomenon took place in cultivated areas of the sahel, but, more recently, gardelle et al. [4] and gal et al. [5] described a spectacular increase in ponds and lakes in pastoral sahel, in the gourma region in northern mali."
2,the change was particularly important for ponds and lakes with a high turbidity and low aquatic vegetation [4].
2,"the increase in concentrated runoff, the overall vegetation decay, and the soil erosion over shallow soils have been identified as the main factors responsible for the increase of surface water in this region [6,7]."
2,"in addition, a recent trend towards increasing daily precipitation extremes has also been detected in the sahel [8–10]."
2,"the increase in runoff and erosion, as well as the precipitation intensification, points towards a possible increase in turbidity and suspended particulate matter (spm) in sahelian lakes and ponds."
2,"beyond their importance for hydrology, sediments also impact the ecology of inland water and potentially also human health."
2,"indeed, spm commonly favors bacteria development and, at the same time, decreases their mortality through ultraviolet protection [11]."
2,"some of these bacteria or microbes cause widespread water diseases like diarrhea, which is one of the major causes of mortality in children under five years in developing countries [12]."
2,"in the gourma, like in most rural areas in the sahel, surface water, in addition to being a fundamental resource for livestock, is largely employed for domestic activities [13,14]."
2,"developing methods to monitor turbidity and spm in this region, where environmental monitoring is limited, is therefore essential."
2,"in-situ information in the sahel is scarce, hence the distribution and the dynamics of spm in lakes and ponds (spm level, seasonal cycles, and inter-annual variability) are poorly known."
2,"the use of satellite data to monitor spm and water turbidity has mainly been focused in temperate coastal areas (e.g., [15,16]), with some studies also addressing tropical areas (e.g., [17–19]) or ocean water (e.g., [20–23])."
2,"however, satellite data has proved useful to track spm and turbidity variability in inland water in different tropical areas."
2,"martinez et al. [24,25], for instance, used modis images to monitor rivers in latin america."
2,feng et al. [26] also used modis data to study spm dynamics in the poyang lake in china.
2,"in africa, kaba et al. [27] studied the temporal dynamics of an ethiopian lake using landsat images, and robert et al. [28] used modis data to document spm and turbidity in a large reservoir in southern burkina faso."
2,"these promising results suggest that a satellite survey may also be developed for the sahel, even if remote sensing in this area may be challenging for several reasons."
2,"first, the sahel is characterized by convective heavy rainfalls, resulting from the large squall lines of the west-african monsoon [29]."
2,"the rainy season is short, extending typically from late june to mid-september, and displays a large inter- and intra-annual variability."
2,"vegetation growth is triggered by rainfall, but plant canopies are usually not very dense, especially in the early rainy season, so soils are prone to water erosion."
2,"all these factors favor high turbidity and spm concentrations, and possibly also high temporal dynamics."
2,"so far, few remote sensing studies [30,31] have addressed the case of extremely turbid inland water."
2,"second, the dry season in the sahel is marked by very high aerosol loadings (mostly mineral dust), whereas atmospheric water vapor is very low in the dry season and very high in the monsoon season."
2,"atmospheric corrections, which impact the quality of surface reflectance retrieval over water, may thus be challenging."
2,all these factors may be detrimental to spm and turbidity monitoring from space.

4,"the agoufou lake is the outlet of an endorheic watershed covering 183.5 km2 [5], which is typical of this region where endoreism (the hydrographic network does not connect to a river) is dominant."
4,its size varies between about 50–70 ha at the end of dry season and 250 ha at the end of the rainy season.
4,"the agoufou lake, following the ecohydrological evolution of the landscape after the major droughts in the 1970s and the 1980s, changed from a seasonal to permanent regime in the 1990s [7]."
4,"two main types of soil are found in the watershed: deep sandy soils covering the downstream portion of the watershed, on which annual herbaceous vegetation develops and some cultivation occurs, and shallow soils (silt layers or sand sheets) on bedrock (sandstones, schist, or iron pans) in the upstream part (soil map in dardel et al."

4,in-situ measurements 2.2.1.
4,"turbidity, spm and granulometry water samples (taken just under the surface of the water) were routinely collected every 7-10 days from october 2014 on the shore of the agoufou lake to perform turbidity and spm measurements."
4,"for security reasons, the sampling was not always performed at exactly the same location (for each sample, the coordinates were recorded with a gps)."
4,"in total, 81 water samples, collected between october 2014 and october 2016, were used for this study."
4,"twenty-four additional water samples, collected between november 2016 and october 2017, were employed to validate the relationship between spm and satellite reflectance."
4,"given the upper limit of the portable turbidimeter used in the field (eutech instruments turbidimeter tn-10, 0–1000 ntu (nephelometric turbidity unit), 850 nm wavelength), in-situ measurements for turbidity are not available for all the water samples collected."
4,"some turbidity measurements, above 1000 ntu, were performed on a subsample of the collected data, with a turbidimeter ranging from 0 to 10,000 ntu (turbidity meter wtw turb 555)."
4,this gives a total of 38 valid measurements for turbidity.
4,"for each sample, three measurements were made and averaged."
4,spm were measured by filtering the water samples using a glass microfiber filter (0.7 µm pore size).
4,the filters were pre-weighed after being dried at 105◦ for 1 h 30 min and were dried again and weighed after water filtration.
4,spm are calculated by the difference between the dry weights after and before filtering divided by the volume of filtered water.
4,"for each sample, two measurements were made and averaged."
4,data pairs with at least one measurement ‘out of range’ were discarded.
4,two water samples (13 september and 14 november 2014) were also analyzed for particle size distribution (psd).
4,"the psd was measured with a laser grain size meter horiba la950-v2 (horiba instruments, inc., kyoto, japan)."

5,2.2.5.
5,livestock monthly livestock numbers at the agoufou lake have been monitored in 2010–2011.
5,this was done by counting each herd during its passage to the watering point.
5,"livestock numbers have been converted to tropical livestock unit (tlu) based on different conversion coefficients for cattle, sheep, and goats [37,38]."
5,"satellite data two landsat products were used in this study (table 1): the surface reflectance (in sr−1 , equivalent to the remote sensing reflectance) by landsat 7 etm+ and by landsat 8 oli, available since 1999 (breakdown of a mirror in 2003) and 2013, respectively."
5,landsat 8 and landsat 7 have a ground track repeat of 16 days each and a 30 m spatial resolution.
5,"the combination of the two satellites provides an acquisition every eight days (when landsat 7 and landsat 8 image are associated, and there are no clouds, aerosols, or stripes for landsat 7 images), which is compatible with the field measurement sampling frequency of 7–10 days."
5,"the spatial resolution of 30 m provides interesting information on the spatial variability between several small water bodies in this region, as well as within the largest lakes."
5,the data (path 195 row 049) were collected from the usgs (united states geological survey) earth explorer data gateway.
5,"the cloudy images, those with high levels of aerosols, and those for which the stripes in l7 masked our sampling area were removed according to the quality data (qa bands used for landsat 7: cloud, adjacent cloud, shadow cloud, and for landsat 8: cloud, adjacent cloud, shadow cloud, aerosol, cirrus) and after a visual check of each image."

5,"the daily modis surface reflectance products mod09ga and myd09ga provide information about aerosols, clouds, cloud shadows, and cirrus."
5,the possible effect of sunglint was also calculated.
5,"images with significant clouds, shadow cloud, cirrus, high aerosol loading, and high sunglint conditions were discarded."
5,"the modis data (mod09q1, myd09q1, mod09ga, myd09ga h7v17) acquired between march 2000 and october 2017 were downloaded through the data pool of the laads distributed active archive center (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)."
5,the seasonal dynamics of the vegetation over the agoufou watershed were monitored by means of the normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) computed from the modis mod13q1 and myd13q1 products (250 m and 16-days intervals).

6,"for landsat, the open-water pixel closest to the in-situ sampling coordinates was retained."
6,"similarly, for the analysis of modis time series, among the few pixels that are always open water, the pixel closest to the sampling point was retained (it happened to always be the same pixel)."
6,possible spatial variability within a modis pixel was not specifically investigated.
6,"correlations were evaluated using the r2 (coefficient of determination, equivalent to the pearson’s correlation), significance levels (p ≤ 0.05) were calculated using the student t-test, and temporal trends were evaluated over 2000–2016 with the r software."

6,"to analyze the spatial distribution of landsat-derived spm over the gourma region, surface waters (open water only) were detected by means of a threshold on the modified normalized difference water index (mndwi, green band − swir band/green band + swir band)."
6,typical values found by rokni et al. [39] for two lakes were 0.45 and 0.27.
6,xu [40] reported values of 0.44 for a lake and 0.56 for a river.
6,"for our study area, we applied a 0.2 threshold."
6,"the aerosol masks and the cloud masks of the landsat reflectance products were used to discard low quality or cloudy pixels (pixels showing values of 52 and 1, respectively)."
6,"these masks were not sufficient, so a threshold of 0.16 on the blue band reflectance was also considered."
6,"moreover, in order to exclude vegetated areas, we imposed ndvi to be less than 0.2 (ndvi threshold used based on a previous study on the classification of water by gardelle et al."

18,"remote sens. 2017, 9, 1272 18 of 22 chains, in atmospheric corrections, and in wavelength and band width."
18,"indeed, the nir and red bands for landsat 8 and modis and the corresponding measured reflectance are closer to each other than to landsat 7 (table 1)."
18,in-situ measurements of reflectance carried out using a spectro-radiometer in burkina faso (bagré lake) revealed a similar difference between the nir reflectance corresponding to the landsat 8 or landsat 7 spectral response [51].
18,the nir band proved to be the most suitable for spm retrieval up to high values.
18,"so far, few studies have addressed such high spm values in inland water and some of our conclusions are consistent with previous work addressing highly turbid estuaries [52]."
18,"for inland water, an exception is the work by wang et al. [31], who also used the nir band to monitor spm in the yangtze river, with values ranging from 22 to 2160 mg/l."
18,"our study confirms the relevance of the nir band and extends its use for values up to 2500 mg/l, with landsat and modis being used separately or in combination."
18,the swir (short-wavelength infrared) band has been suggested in some studies to retrieve spm in very turbid waters.
18,"knaep et al. [53] proposed an algorithm based on the swir band at 1020 µm (i.e., sentinel-3) and 1240 µm (modis, viirs—visible infrared imaging radiometer suite) to derive spm up to 1400 mg/l."
18,"in our study, adding the swir bands from landsat 8 did not improve the spm retrievals."
18,this is probably due to the fact that landsat 8 bands (band 6 at 1.56–1.66 µm and band 7 at 2.1–2.3 µm) have higher wavelengths than those provided by sentinel-3 and modis (the modis band at 1240 µm couldn’t be tested on the agoufou lake given its coarser spatial resolution).
18,"given the high values of spm and turbidity, the fact that the water level of the agoufou lake remains higher than 1 m and the relationships between in-situ spm and satellite reflectance also holds at the end of the dry season, when water levels are at a minimum, implies that background effects on the reflectance can be excluded."
18,"in addition, we found little evidence for edge effects (see figures 12 and 13), which is probably due to the mask employed to define pure water pixels."
18,"the seasonal spm variability of the agoufou lake, and more generally of the lakes and ponds in this region, was found to be dependent on meteorological factors."
18,"first of all, the most significant increase in spm is related to precipitation and occurs in the first half of the rainy season, which triggers large surface runoff, especially in areas where vegetation is not yet developed."
18,"later in the rainy season, the development of the vegetation, as well as a possible limitation of available erodible material, reduces surface runoff and sediment transport."
18,"in the early dry season, when winds are usually moderate, spm decreases due to particle deposition."
18,a second important spm peak is observed during the dry season in all but the driest years.
18,"this peak is linked to the resuspension of sediments caused by high winds during the harmattan period, and possibly favored, for some lakes, by an important fetch since the surfaces of the lakes are still relatively large during this period."
18,"wind-driven resuspension in shallow lakes has been reported in different areas [41], including the sahel."
18,"sané et al. [42] pointed out its impact for the guiers lake in senegal, which is 2 m deep on average."
18,the maximum depth for the agoufou lake and other lakes in the gourma area is typically a few meters and the depth regularly decreases toward the shoreline.
18,"the final spm decay, in the late dry season, is probably also linked to the wind regime and to the return of the monsoon flow."
18,"this period also corresponds to maximum downward radiation (shortwave plus longwave, guichard et al. [44]), which possibly favors thermal stratification of the lake and would hinder resuspension."
18,livestock numbers have not been found to be correlated with spm.
18,"surprisingly, the late season maximum in livestock numbers, caused by concentration around the few permanent water bodies, is a period of minimum spm."
18,a significant increasing trend in spm was observed for the agoufou lake using the whole modis time series.
18,"it corresponds to an increase in the nir reflectance of 8%, which is higher than the calibration drift (less than 2%) identified for modis collection 6 [48]."
18,"the increasing spm trend is consistent with the runoff increase observed in this area [7,36]."
18,"our results suggest that both the extent in turbid water surface and spm within these lakes may increase in parallel, due to changes in surface characteristics and/or to the intensification of rainfall events [8–10]."
18,"moreover, an increasing trend of"
19,"remote sens. 2017, 9, 1272 19 of 22 spm was also observed for the bagré lake in sub-humid west africa (with a 19% increase between 2000 and 2015, robert et al."
19,[28]).
19,conclusions this study assessed the capability of high and medium resolution satellite sensors to monitor spm in a sahelian region.
19,"the important variability in the hydrological cycle at the seasonal and interannual time scale, the extremely high values of turbidity and spm found in this region, and the strong and variable atmospheric load (aerosols and water vapor) were potentially challenging for a remote sensing approach."
19,"this study proved that nir reflectance data from modis and landsat are well suited to retrieve spm values up to 2500 mg/l (r2 = 0.79, bias = 20.3 mg/l, rmse = 290 mg/l, %diff = 3.8, %absdiff = 15.4) in this region, though there is room for algorithm improvement in atmospheric correction and spm retrieval."
19,spm derived from modis and landsat were used to investigate the spm spatio-temporal variability in sahelian lakes and ponds and its drivers.
19,"we have found that spm variability results from a combination of hydrological and atmospheric processes, resulting in a strong but complex seasonal cycle, a substantial inter annual variability, with particle resuspension occurring during most but not all years, usually high to very high spm values, and a marked spatial variability."
19,"finally, a 27% increasing trend of spm was observed for the agoufou lake over the 2000–2016 period."
19,"this could be due to either precipitation intensification [9], or an increase in erosion over the agoufou watershed [7], or both."
19,poor water quality and related health hazards are among the possible consequences of increasing spm in surface waters.
19,"turbid water often carries microbiological contaminants, which combines with the health vulnerabilities of local populations to produce microbiological health risks."
19,"since environmental monitoring infrastructures are presently scarce in the sahel, satellite monitoring of small water bodies, made possible with the high resolution of landsat and sentinel-2 time series, opens important perspectives for understanding the physical mechanisms regulating the spm spatio-temporal variability and for mapping water quality and related health hazards in this region."
