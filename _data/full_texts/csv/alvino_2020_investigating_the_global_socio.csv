1,"originally, satellites, remote sensing (rs), and other navigations systems were only employed for government and military purposes."
1,"however, in the past two decades there has been an increase use of these tools for commercial purposes."
1,"in particular, satellites and rs can be used for space and earth observations, support military operations, precision agriculture, meteorological forecasting, communication and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking and monitoring of utility networks."
1,"in this paper, we analyse the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellites and rs."
1,"in particular, we try to identify the main socio-economic benefits deriving from the use of rs in several sectors."
1,"we also seek to introduce economists to the science of rs data, and give a flavour of how this new fountain of data can be utilized so far and what might be done in the future."
1,"keywords: satellite industry, remote sensing, socio-economic benefits, satellite industry revenues introduction space has always been an engine for innovation (flemish space industry (2018))."
1,space inspired us to cross limits of the possible and walk into the impossible.
1,"exploring and observing the space allowed us to discover the solar system and asteroids, study the nature of dark matter, acquire images of earthquake and tsunami, monitor lakes and rivers and watch the world’s see traffic (nasa (2017); space station research and technology (2017))."
1,these observations have had a massive impact on our lives.
1,"for instance, it has improved our understanding of climate, forecasting the weather, assessing environmental hazards and managing natural resources."
1,"however, most of the benefits arisen from space observations are still unknown and difficult to quantify due to intangible and long-term factors."
1,"the goal of this paper is to provide a critical literature review of the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellite industry and remote sensing (rs)."
1,"we identify if and how satellite and in particular rs improve our life, and what are the main socio-economic benefits deriving from the use of rs in several sectors, including but not limited to the smart and precision agriculture, universal navigation, meteorological forecasting, broadcast of live television and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking, resource extraction and monitoring of utility networks."
2,vision 2020: sustainable economic development and application of innovation management the paper is organized as follows.
2,"in section 2, the employed methodology is described."
2,"in section 3, we analyse the economic aspect of the satellite industry and the main application of satellites."
2,"in section 4, we illustrate and classify the remote sensing applications in different sectors."
2,"in the final section, the conclusions and limitations of the employed study are discussed."
2,methodology the bibliographic research can be divided in two steps.
2,"in the first step, we searched information about satellite industry and rs in the main federal, government and private space agencies and associations (e.g."
2,"nasa, space foundation)."
2,"in the second step, only peer-reviewed or blind- reviewed academic books and papers were examined."
2,"to access to the content of the articles, two different and main were used: scopus and web of science."
2,"the papers were selected using different keywords (e.g. satellite industry, economic benefits of satellites, remote sensing)."
2,"next, papers were selected on the base of title and abstract."
2,the papers selected belongs to journals from several domains: economic (e.g.
2,"journal of political economy, journal of economic perspectives), management (e.g."
2,"journal of innovation economics & management), agriculture (e.g."
2,"american journal of agricultural and biological sciences), remote sensing (remote sensing), other (e.g."
2,"atmospheric measurement techniques, journal of applied ecology) and conference (e.g."
2,proceedings of national conference on development & planning for drought prone areas).
2,satellite industry satellite industry is an important part of the space economy.
2,"more than 76.82% of the world space economy turnover came from the satellite industry (barbaroux (2016); satellite industry association (2017)), such as the combination of satellite services, satellite manufacturing, satellite launch services and satellite ground equipment (nasa (2017); space station research and technology (2017))."
2,"in particular, the global satellite industry revenues increased from 122 billion dollars in 2005 to 206.5 billion dollars in 2016, approximately by 1.6% in nine years (figure 1 and 2), even though more than 44% of the satellite global industry is served by the nasa."
2,"the global satellite industry growth was 2% in 2016, below worldwide economic growth (3.1%) and slightly above the u.s. growth (1.6%) (satellite industry association (2017))."
2,"more importantly, the forecasts of several governmental and no-governmental agencies and research institutes (e.g."
2,"space foundation, nasa, european gnss agency, new zealand space agency, and satellite industry association) show that the satellite industry will continue to demonstrate steady and consistent growth."
2,this growth has also a positive effect on employment rates.
2,"in fact, satellite industry and earth operations require workers in many different occupations, such as scientists, engineers, technicians, media and communications 235"
3,vision 2020: sustainable economic development and application of innovation management fig.
3,1: the global revenues of tthe satellite industry were 206.5 billion dollars in 2016.
3,the pie chart shows how each sectoror of the satellite industry contributes to the global rev evenue. and photographers.
3,"for instance, e, employment of aerospace engineers is projected to grow ow 6% from 2016 to 2026 in usa (bureau of labor statistics (2018))."
3,"the median annual wage for aerospace engineers was 113,030 dollars in may 2017 (bureau of labor statistics (2018))."
3,"federaderal agencies such as nasa employ more than an 17,000 workers (angeles and vilorio (2016))."
3,"other ggovernment agencies, such as u.s."
3,"departmeent of defense, the federal communications commissio sion, and the national science foundation, also lso employ workers in space-related occupations (angeless aand vilorio (2016))."
3,"finally, private compananies, including those that contract with federal agencie ncies, employ workers in industries such as aero erospace product and parts manufacturing and scientific research re and development services (angeles and an vilorio (2016))."
3,"for example, space research and tech echnology in harris county, texas employedd 22,920 in march 2016, with average weekly wages of ab about 2,540 dollars."
3,the global number of satellitess lulunched is increasing rapidly in the past 7 years.
3,"accord ording to the 2018 index of objects launchedd into outer space provided by the united nations office fice for outer space affairs (unoosa), 8,126 26 objects have been launched into space in human historyory, and over 22% of these were lunched with ithin the last eight years alone."
3,"currently, there are 4,857 857 satellites orbiting the planet (1,980 of those se are active) —an increase of almost 5% in the last fivee years. y only at the beginning of 2018, unoos osa has recorded 204 objects launched into space."
3,"in total tal, there are 81 countries with operators repre resented by at least one satellite, even if some of them are a part of regional consortia (unoosa (20 2018))."
3,usa has the highest number of satellites (859).
3,followed fo by china with 250 and russia with h 146 (unoosa (2018)).
3,"other countries such as japann (72), india (55) and the uk (52) also havee a large number of satellites (unoosa (2018))."
3,"at leas east other 19 countries have, or are planningg to host spaceports for orbital or suborbital launches (f (facchinetti (2016))."
3,"although sometimes, sa satellites are also launched by institutions and organisaisations that represent continents such as the euro european space agency."

4,"2 applications of satellites analysing the countries involved ed in the satellite industry is certainly relevant, however we believe that it is not sufficient to define the th potential and large-scale benefit of the use of satellite ite."
4,"thus, we tried to examine the main actors rs involved in the satellite industry and the main usages of satellites."
4,"from the past experiences, we iden entify that satellites can be used for three main reasons: government, go military and commercial purposes es."
4,satellite uses by government are re almost 700 (unoosa (2018)).
4,"government satellite ac activities are military or civil activities suchch as earth observation, navigation, and science and ttechnology development (bryce space and d technology (2017); satellite industry association (20 2017))."
4,"for instance, satellites provide inform rmation about earth's clouds, oceans, land, air, wildfires, s, volcanoes, stars, asteroids, comets, and plananets exploration including (nasa (2017); space station ion research and technology (2017))."
4,"satellites ites recognize earth observation images, such as the katrina ina hurricane prediction at u.s. coast."
4,"the dat ata captured by the noaa goes satellites, serve to illustrate ill the danger of these enormous storm ms."
4,"they bring a clear benefit by predicting damages to the u.s. government in general, and accur urate prediction of severe weather can help to address thehe economic and social costs of weather-related ted damages (hertzfeld and williamson (2007))."
4,military forces (e.g.
4,"ministries of defence, air forces, defence acquisition agencies) use about 400 satellites, almost 20% of the all active ones (barbaroux (2016); unoosa (2018))."
4,"in particular, satellites are used for surveillance ce, imagery and communications."
4,"various satellite applica ications such as rs, communications systems, ms, and gps can be utilized in the war on terror to fac facilitate and support military operations andd intelligence gathering (lee and steel (2014))."
4,"regard rding secure communications worldwide, milit ilitary satellites provide low data rate communications for voice and data at 75 bps to 2,400 bps and m medium data rate communications at 4.8 kbps to 1.544 m mbps (price tag of 800 million dollars) (lee ee and steele (2014))."
4,"instead, rs data has been used in i order to gathering visible light for photogrgraphy, recording imagery in those parts of the spectra, scanning sc the surface of the earth, detecting anand record radio, telephone, and data transmissions on thehe earth and transmissions relayed by commun unications satellites (lee and steele (2014))."
4,"before the 21st century, satellites es were entirely used for military and government purposes. es."
4,"however, the past two decades revealed a significant decrease in military orders together withh a growing importance of commercial and non non-government demands for satellite technology (barbarou roux (2016))."
4,"nowadays, 41.7% of the active sa satellites (826 in total) is used for commercial purposes (p (particularly from start-up companies, unoo osa (2018))."
4,"the commercial services and products tha hat satellites provide are radio and television n broadcasting, broadband connections, navigation aerona nautical and nautical system for organisations ons and a people around the world (bryce space and technolo logy (2018); 237"
5,vision 2020: sustainable economic development and application of innovation management pham (2013)).
5,"satellites can also be used to improve mobile connections and communications as well as location-based services (lbs) for smartphones, tablets, laptops and people tracking devices (pham (2013))."
5,the use of satellites is also increasing in order to improve data traffic and to support wireless networks connections and requirements.
5,"in fact, the rapid growing data traffic brings increasing pressure to the wireless networks, which is predicted to increase by over 10,000 times in the next 20 years (kuang et al (2018))."
5,communication and internet providers are increasingly bonded to guarantee continuous data connection in order to support services such as machine-to-machine communication and internet of things.
5,"existing terrestrial wireless networks are not able to support these services, considering the deficiency in ubiquitous on-demand coverage (kuang et al (2018))."
5,"satellites could be used to increase networks coverage and requirements for rural, remote and other not-well-connected areas."
5,"in the next future, terrestrial networks will be used to achieve high-speed data service at low cost, instead satellites will be used to cover an area with a radius of thousands of kilometres, providing coverage to otherwise inaccessible locations (kuang et al (2018))."
5,"overall the consumer equipment for satellite tv, radio, broadband, and mobile satellite terminals revenues is increasing (1% growth in 2016) (satellite industry association (2017))."
5,"in particular, satellite radio and consumer satellite broadband posted 10% and 3% growth respectively in the consumer services segment, while more mature satellite tv stayed flat in 2016 (satellite industry association (2017))."
5,"however, satellite tv services still account for 77% of all satellite services revenues (97.7 billion dollars) with up to 220 million satellite pay-tv subscribers worldwide, driven by demand in emerging markets (satellite industry association (2017))."
5,"remote sensing (rs) earth observation applications mainly designate rs capabilities, distant, on-orbit, and earth surveillance (lodgson (2011); morel (2013))."
5,"earth observation and rs services revenues grew 11% only in 2016, thus it is forecasted that earth observation will take the lead with 73% of the applications market in the future research (satellite industry association (2017); international space safety foundation (2018))."
5,rs can be defined as “the science of observation from a distance” (barrett and curtis (1999)).
5,rs and earth observing satellites maximize our understanding about environment and provide some global perspectives on developments.
5,"rs can be utilized in different fields, such as medicine (diagnosis and surgery), industry (quality control of products), and viticulture (monitoring and managing variations in productivity within single vineyard blocks) (barrett and curtis (1999); hall et al (2002))."
5,"according to the satellite industry association (2017), the continued growth is due to established satellite rs companies with new entrants reporting revenue, whereas the largest revenue growth occurred in defence, intelligence and in the sectors of energy and natural resources, allowing for pre-planning and management."
5,"dave and adam (2016) report that the main advantages of rs data to economists are divided into three categories: 1) access to information difficult to obtain by other means, 2) unusually high spatial resolution, and 3) wide geographic coverage."
5,"firstly, rs technology provides panel data at low marginal cost, repeatedly, and at large scale on proxies for a wide range of hard-to-measure characteristics."
5,"secondly, rs data sources are typically available at a substantially higher degree of spatial resolution than traditional data."
5,much of the publicly available satellite imagery used by economists provide readings for each of the hundreds of billions of 30-meter-by-30-meter grid cells of land surface on earth.
5,"thirdly, rs data provide wide geographic coverage."
5,"using rs, scientists can study data that have been collected in a consistent manner—without regard for local events like political strife or natural disasters—across borders and with uniform spatial sampling on every inhabited continent."
5,"equally important, many research satellites offer substantial temporal coverage, capturing data from the same location at weekly or even daily frequency for several decades and counting."
5,such as this aspect of rs works on the economic impacts of climate change and agriculture (costinot et al (2016)).
6,"vision 2020: sustainable economic development and application of innovation management rs applications in different sectors remote sensing technology generates and encompasses a wide variety of data, for speed, types and velocity."
6,"thus, the processing and interpretation of rs data have specific uses within various fields of study, for instance agriculture, geology and forestry (alvino and marino (2017), barrett and curtis (1999), navalgund et al (2007))."
6,"based on our finding, we identified four main area of application of remote sensing technology."
6,"we argue that rs can be used for 1) military surveillance, 2) environment, 3) human activities and 4) environmental and illegal issues caused by human activities (see table 1)."
6,"firstly, an important area of application of rs system is military surveillance."
6,"rs systems are often used for military purposes, in order to improve organization, strategic, tactical, and logistic functions of military organizations (hudston et al (1975))."
6,"rs can help to spy on enemies, to create 3d maps of uranium enrichment site and to spot undeclared nuclear power plants (e.g."
6,india) and (lee and steele (2014)).
6,"rs can also help to identify intercontinental ballistic missile launches, methods for the detection of atmospheric contaminants, such as poison gas, under field conditions, aids for the precision delivery of weaponry (including passive, active, and laser designator guidance techniques), and sensor systems for reconnaissance and surveillance (lee and steele (2014))."
6,"secondly, rs system are used to study several environmental issues."
6,"rs can help to improve our understanding of weather forecast or help researchers and companies in more complex tasks such as assessing and managing natural resources, extracting mineral deposits and more importantly monitoring climate changing."
6,"over the last century, forest covers of the world have declined at an alarming rate."
6,"with the help of rs data, governments and researchers can generate information with regards to forest cover, types of forest present within the area of the study, human encroachment into forest land/protected areas, encroachment of desert like conditions and so on (oisebe (2012))."
6,"thirdly, rs can be used to improve several human actives in different fields (we refer to activities that can be accomplished only thought human actions)."
6,"for instance, in agriculture, rs can be in both precision agriculture and farming."
6,"in fact, rs data used provides a synoptic view and multi-temporal data for land use and land cover mapping."
6,"thus, rs can help researchers and governments by giving a quicker and cost effective analysis for various applications with accuracy for planning (prakasam (2010))."
6,"rs data can also use in construction (map updating, city modelling, urban growth analysis, change monitoring) (khoshelham et al (2010)) or in urban land use management."
6,rs provide benefits for on fundamental observations of urban encroachment and environmental monitoring that are not available from other sources (batty and howes (2001)).
6,"finally, rs system can be used to monitor illegal actions that have an impact on both environment or human activities."
6,"illegal actives (e.g. sex trade and illegal forest cutting) are usually performed in remote areas or at night (night lights), thus it is really difficult for police or federal agencies be able to identify with traditional tools."
6,"instead, rs system records visible and near-infrared light from clouds and the earth’s surface at night (li et al (2017))."
6,the geospatial time series of data generated by rs can be a valuable source for locate criminal activity.

9,"these observations have changed –and are still changing–human knowledge, pushing the boundaries and addressing fundamental questions about our planet and the history of human."
9,"in this paper, we analyse the economic trends and composition of the satellites industry."
9,we conclude that the worldwide turnover and economic growth of the satellite industry-as well as the global number of satellites lunched in the space- is increasing.
9,"satellites industry contributes to industrial and governmental economies worldwide (206.5 billion dollars in 2016), creating direct and indirect jobs (e.g. researchers, engineers, technicians, etc.)."
9,satellite industry has driven scientific and technological innovations that benefit people around the globe every day.
9,"in fact, satellites have improved our understanding of climate, forecasting the weather, assessing environmental hazards and managing natural resources, radio and television broadcasting, communication and increasing networks coverage and requirements (e.g."
9,machine-to-machine communication and internet of things).
9,"we also examine how the satellite industry contributes to deliver value by providing a central point for industry, defence and government entities."
9,"we identify three main applications of satellites: governmental, military and commercial uses."
9,"initially, satellites were used only for government and military purposes."
9,"in recent years, private and commercial satellites become a significant provider of satellite services."
9,"in fact, almost 42% of the total satellites is used for commercial purposes."
9,"even tough, satellites are used mainly for commercial purposes, we conclude that satellite industry embeds a large variety of application fields that are at the edge of government, military and commercial purposes."
9,"in this paper, we also focus on remote sensing (rs) technologies, as part the earth observation."
9,"we investigate the socio-economic benefits of rs applications, in particular we identify the main rs applications in different sectors."
9,the rs systems utilize sensors and instruments that produce a huge amount of data at different scales (temporal and spatial) and distances from the target.
9,rs systems can maximize our understanding about environment and provide some global perspectives on developments.
9,"rs data can provide access to information difficult to obtain by other means, using high spatial resolution and wide 242"
10,vision 2020: sustainable economic development and application of innovation management geographic coverage.
10,"hence, rs data compared to other systems allow to reduce costs as well as to provide that data that are more accurate, constantly trackable, superior quality resolution and higher traffic."
10,"in particular, we identify four different area of applications in which the use of rs has contributed to improve academic, industrial, military and governmental operations such as military surveillance (e.g. spotting undeclared nuclear power plants, spying on enemies), environment (e.g. climate changes, pollutions monitoring, natural resources), human activities (e.g. agriculture, archaeology and prehistory, constructions), environmental and illegal issues caused by human activities (e.g. health of populations, monitoring of illegal activities, fiscal control)."
10,"we conclude that rs systems can substantially improve our knowledge of earth phenomena, monitoring resources and improving our prediction of natural disasters and treats in different sectors."
10,"in fact, rs can contribute to manage processes and resource assessment in an easier, safer, and cost- effective way."
10,limitations and future work this study has a certain number of limitations.
10,"in this paper, we did not consider the costs related to the use of satellites industry and rs systems."
10,future research could try to investigate the main costs related to the construction and lunch of satellites.
10,"moreover, it would be useful try to estimate the costs of the satellites lunched into the space but currently not in use."
10,"we also did not examine the main advantages related to the non-satellite industry, as part of the space economy."
10,"future studies could try to identify the socio-economic benefits of the non-satellite industry, plus investigating the main differences between satellites and non-satellites industry."
