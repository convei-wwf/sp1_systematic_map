1,"for many years landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the united open data states geological survey (usgs) made landsat data accessible via the internet for free."
1,"substantial increases in policy downloads of landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, land cover serving government, private sector, and civil society."
1,"the landsat program hence provides an example to space land use agencies worldwide on the value of open access for earth observation data and has spurred the adaption of land change similar policies globally, including the european copernicus program."
1,"here, we describe important aspects of the landsat free and open data policy and highlight the importance and continued relevance of this policy."
1,introduction fulﬁlling user requisitions.
1,"in 2008, the usgs adopted a free and open landsat data policy (woodcock et al., 2008), which led to a substantial since the launch of landsat-1 in 1972, the landsat program has increase in the use of landsat data that has been beneﬁcial to many occupied a unique niche and today represents the longest running ter- segments of society (roy et al., 2014; wulder et al., 2012; wulder et al., restrial satellite record."

2,landsat science team perspectives landsat imagery.
2,"similarly, at the same time when the charge for data was lifted, the usgs also added certain higher-level processing (e.g., the free and open landsat data policy has periodically come under orthorectiﬁcation), which reduced the need for some preprocessing scrutiny (landsat advisory group, 2012; popkin, 2018)."
2,"indeed, as of steps making landsat data more attractive for users."
2,"however, the 2018, the u.s. federal government is seeking to “explore how putting a sharp and exponential increase in the post-2008 use of landsat illu- price on landsat data might aﬀect scientists and other users” (popkin, strated in fig. 1 exceeds gains attributable to advances in internet ca- 2018)."
2,the possibility of a policy change away from free and open pacity for that period.
2,"furthermore, the usgs statistics do not include access has raised uncertainty and a high level of concern in the remote data access from secondary platforms, such as google earth engine or sensing and stakeholder communities."
2,"based upon insights gleaned amazon web services that started hosting landsat data after 2008, and from our participation on the usgs-nasa landsat science team, we so the actual increases are greater than those illustrated in fig."

2,the annual number of publications started to increase after 1999 when the price 2.1.
2,relationship between cost and use was reduced to $600 usd.
2,"after 2008, the number increased rapidly, reaching almost 1600 in 2017."
2,the landsat free and open data policy the ﬁrst and most obvious evidence for the value of the free and thus corresponds to a more than four-fold increase in the annual open landsat data policy is the rapid increase in landsat data ordering number of publications.
2,"furthermore, the rapid rise in the number of and use after the policy was enacted in 2008."
2,"fig. 1 shows annual publications is expected to continue given the high number of down- statistics of the price, number of downloads, and number of publica- loads in recent years and typical lag times from analysis to publication tions related to landsat data."
2,"prior to 2008, costs for an individual of one to three years."
2,"this increase in landsat related publications landsat multispectral scanner (mss) image varied from $20 usd highlights the opportunity for innovation that has resulted from the (1972–1978) to $200 usd (1979–1982), increased from approximately open data policy, as well as the expansion in applications and landsat $3000 to $4000 usd for a landsat thematic mapper image derived information products."
