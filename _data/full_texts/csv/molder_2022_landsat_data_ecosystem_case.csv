13,this was due in part to the larger number of disclosure agreements.
13,"all platform users we did interview were downstream actors using daas data products and the from the non-proﬁt or academic sector, or provided data or accompanying difﬁculty in fully understanding all of their use information products to these sectors, reﬂecting different cases, particularly where data and services are free to access. priorities between private and non-proﬁt or academic sectors these providers acknowledged there are many downstream users in the application of eo data for addressing particular problems. of their data, and in some cases maintained public collections of use cases, but they commonly lacked understanding about the trust in and familiarity of landsat diversity of applications in which their data are employed: actor trust in landsat products as accurate or otherwise useful representations of the environment also shaped likelihood of “collecting downstream data on landsat users is really product use by end users we interviewed."

13,"as noted, downstream actors actors to a lesser degree than did non-proﬁt daas or ipaas generally trusted the validity of data products and services providers, while private sector paas providers reported varying from upstream providers because they trusted upstream actor degrees of understanding of their downstream users and technical expertise."
13,this type of trust may stem from positive past applications.

14,"from our literature search, it seemed that as long as landsat is the primary dataset used to train remote sensing there was a surge of interest and literature at the turn of the scientists and users."

15,"understanding end users’ needs, how eo products can fulﬁll while generating novel and often highly accurate scientiﬁc insights them, and how to provide these products in a way that is most about the environment is facilitated through cloud computing and relevant and useful to them was challenging for many actors."
15,"one big data technologies, providing this information to policy makers saas provider cited the difﬁculties in bridging the gap between did not necessarily drive signiﬁcant change or lead to desired research and real-world application: outcomes for this actor and others."
15,"in contrast to land and resource management applications (e.g., “i think that’s one barrier for entry that comes up ... we’re allocating funds to stop spread of invasive species), advocacy (e.g., producing a lot of good data, but it’s just hard for the [users] lobbying city planners to block industry expansion) is focused on to apply that to their work long term."

16,"qualitative research methods as this paper focused on the generation of value using like those used in this study offer a powerful approach to landsat, it is also important for future efforts that translate understanding the beneﬁts, challenges, and value actors eo data into societal value to consider the often-signiﬁcant experience using eo data."
16,"such an approach can also illuminate differences in how value is conceptualized between private, the role of social factors like communication, trust, and public, non-proﬁt, or academic intermediaries, as well as applications of eo data science."
16,"in this paper, we highlighted social values held by members of the public not involved in lde characteristics, both technical and social, that shape the decision-making."
16,"value is generated when end users use data for movement of landsat data downstream to add value for decision-making (virapongse et al., 2020), and value is thus downstream actors."
16,"overall, the observation from one of the connected to the ability to measure outcomes related to data use. study participants that “it’s not rocket science to work with” outcome success for private sector end users is quantiﬁable in when referring to landsat data best illustrates the accrued value economic terms, driving the commercialization of value-added along the value chains examined here."

16,"private sector chain literally starts with “rocket science”, as intermediate actors intermediaries in this study were bound by non-disclosure process, reformat, analyze, and share landsat derived products agreements from sharing customer information, and value- their complexity is reduced and value for use is increased."
16,actors added products were rarely available free of charge.
16,"value of interviewed in this study reported landsat’s historical archive and spatial information for resource management or environmental availability as a free and open data source as beneﬁcial or essential advocacy, on the other hand, is more difﬁcult to measure for their applications."
16,"those who incorporated machine learning (ostendorf, 2011), and success is primarily framed in non- algorithms and cloud computing infrastructure, particularly where quantiﬁable societal beneﬁts rather than monetary measures. available on a user-friendly analytics platform, reported that these as such, sharing of data products by public, non-proﬁt, and tools saved signiﬁcant time and facilitated analyses at greater scale academic actors in this study was not shaped by efforts to compared to previous approaches."
16,"similarly, downstream users of acquire a return on investment and were made publicly data products created using cloud computing and machine available for downstream use."

16,"non-monetary valuation approaches and efforts to understand through interviewing lde actors to understand how societal social values formation will be especially relevant to further value is generated, we identiﬁed several challenges."
16,"first, there is a research examining how eo data generates societal value need for more granular analysis of the differences between actor (ravenscroft, 2019; stålhammar, 2021). roles within each organization."
16,"actor roles in this study often the value of eo data and their technical characteristics have overlapped in terms of what providers delivered to downstream been the focus of numerous studies using quantitative analytical users which complicated efforts to assign distinct actor roles to methods (bouma et al., 2011; miller et al., 2013; loomis et al., each organization."
16,"the qualitative interview approach employed 2015; straub et al., 2019)."
16,there is also a rich and growing body in mapping the lde offers potential for uncovering nuances that of literature on open data ecosystems in a variety of contexts are not readily visible from the outside.
16,"second, even where (lindman et al., 2005; zuiderwijk et al., 2014; styrin et al., 2017). products were well-ﬁt to an actor’s capability and delivered in this study we used a qualitative approach to understand the information that reduced uncertainty in decision-making, societal value produced through the landsat data ecosystem. there were often other factors that shaped the likelihood of a we focused on the interactions between actors and the ways in product’s use in practice."
16,"institutional momentum of existing which they transformed landsat data and derived products to operations was, in some cases, a difﬁcult hurdle to overcome in deliver value downstream."
16,by examining value as perceived by adopting landsat-derived decision support tools.
16,"this was linked end users, we identiﬁed a variety of non-technical dimensions of to end users’ familiarity and frequency of communication with the data ecosystem that shaped product usefulness and product providers, such that end users who worked more closely useability in decision support applications."
16,"actors positioned with data providers reported more openness to adopting novel directly upstream of end users, particularly those familiar with decision-making processes in their day-to-day operations than eo data-driven decision-making, played a critical role in did end users with less frequent contact."
16,this highlights the delivering products that ﬁt end user information needs.

16,"as the volume and variety of eo data continue to practice does not guarantee achievement of desired outcomes for grow, so does the complexity in measuring societal value decision makers or translation of beneﬁts to society more broadly generated by their use."
16,qualitative approaches like that as information availability is only one factor that ultimately employed herein offer a promising methodology for mapping impacts decision-making.
