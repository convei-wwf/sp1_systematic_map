1,"digital information technologies, such as the 26 27 16 internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making 28 29 30 17 and resource management."
1,the data poverty index (dpi) provides an open-source means of 31 32 18 annually evaluating global access to data and information.
1,"the dpi can be used to monitor 33 34 35 19 aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential 36 37 20 application at local (district) levels."
1,"access to data and information is a major factor in 38 39 21 disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate 40 41 42 22 change."
1,"in that context, the dpi could be a useful tool for monitoring the sustainable 43 44 23 development goals of the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (2015-2030)."
1,"the 45 46 47 24 effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software 48 49 25 and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and 50 51 52 26 disaster risk reduction."
1,"unlike many other indices, the dpi is underpinned by datasets that are 53 54 27 consistently provided annually for almost all the countries of the world and can be 55 56 28 downloaded without restriction or cost."

2,"3 4 5 32 introduction 6 7 33 the divide in information and communication technology (ict) provision, between 8 9 10 34 different countries or regions of the world, is referred to as the global digital divide (norris, 11 12 35 2001)."
2,"development programs, international funding agencies and qualified decision making 13 14 15 36 (i.e., decision making that is based on facts, measurements and maps) require standardized 16 17 37 indicators to measure the impact of their programs and decisions (desiere et al., 2015)."
2,"poor 18 19 20 38 quality data affects even high-profile international development efforts, such as the 21 22 39 millennium development goals (mdgs), set by the united nations (un)."
2,"however, 23 24 40 according to a report by an independent un advisory group published on november 6th 2014, 25 26 27 41 the figures used to track progress are unsteady."
2,"the availability of data on 55 core indicators 28 29 42 for 157 countries has never exceeded 70% (the economist, 2014)."
2,tools and methods to 30 31 32 43 monitor the progress in achieving the mdgs have been limited.
2,"this is an issue that needs to 33 34 44 be addressed with the sustainable development goals of the sendai framework for disaster 35 36 37 45 risk reduction (2015-2030): an improved index is required to enable reliable, effective 38 39 46 monitoring (griggs et al., 2013)."
2,"40 41 47 the year 2015 was important for global policy, due to three un processes: (i) the search 42 43 44 48 for a long term agreement on dealing with greenhouse gases, (ii) the finalization and adoption 45 46 49 of the sustainable development goals; and (iii) the development of a successor to the hyogo 47 48 49 50 framework for action as a global disaster risk reduction plan."
2,"there is a link for all of them 50 51 51 with respect to sustainable development, poverty, vulnerability, and disasters (kelman et al., 52 53 54 52 2015)."
2,"current and emerging socio-economic and social-ecological system dynamics require 55 56 53 a new set of easy to apply monitoring tools (griggs et al., 2013, benson & craig, 2014)."
2,"57 58 59 54 when assessing poverty, specifically data poverty, indicators ideally follow the smart 60 61 55 criteria: specific, measurable, available cost-effectively, relevant and timely available (the 62 63 64 2 65"
3,"56 european evaluation network for rural development, 2014)."
3,"1 2 57 in the past few decades information and communication technology (ict) has 3 4 5 58 profoundly altered societies around the world, with people and information becoming ever 6 7 59 more connected (buys et al., 2009)."
3,the evolving trends in access and consumption of ict 8 9 10 60 provide a useful metric of global development.
3,"access to mobile phone networks, the internet 11 12 61 and social media have more recently had significant influence, not just for general social 13 14 15 62 interaction, but also in sustainable development and disaster management applications 16 17 63 (houston et al., 2015)."
3,the metrics derived from these elements could also provide a better 18 19 64 understanding of global development and new insights into variations in the vulnerability of 20 21 22 65 societies.
3,23 24 66 the term ‘digital divide’ first became widely known through a u.s.
3,"department of 25 26 27 67 commerce report, “falling through the net: a survey of the 'have nots' in rural and urban 28 29 68 america” (national telecommunications and information administration, 1995)."
3,"today the 30 31 32 69 term ‘data poverty’ is often linked to economic growth (world bank, 2006, buys et al., 2009, 33 34 70 itu, 2012)."
3,"‘digital divide’ is, in general, defined as the gap between those who have good 35 36 71 access to computers, digital data and information via the internet, and those who do not (van 37 38 39 72 dijk, 2006)."
3,huang & chen (2010) and hilbert (2011) provide a fairly recent discussion about 40 41 73 the various aspects of the global digital divide.
3,"baban et al. (2004, 2008) used a similar term, 42 43 44 74 ‘information poverty’, in the context of a lack of effective and reliable data and information, 45 46 75 for hazard assessment and decision-making in low-income countries."
3,"47 48 49 76 to compare differences between countries in access to digital data, leidig and teeuw 50 51 77 (2015a) developed the data poverty index (dpi)."
3,in this article we use the dpi to analyse 52 53 78 access to data and information in a time series from 2009 to 2013.
3,"the dpi focuses on 54 55 56 79 technological aspects, but also considers the provision of university education as a measure of 57 58 80 the level of possible sophistication of information usage."
3,we carry out time series analysis on 59 60 61 81 the data poverty index to examine the dynamic state of the digital divide.
3,while there is a 62 63 64 3 65
4,"82 general trend with regard to the income classification of the world bank, there are further 1 2 83 trends, sometimes conflicting, when considering individual nations or when analysing the 3 4 5 84 trends from regional perspectives."
4,6 7 8 85 methodology 9 10 11 86 the approach used here to evaluate and monitor national-scale changes in data poverty is 12 13 87 based on the methodology of leidig and teeuw (2015a).
4,"however, that method had to be 14 15 88 simplified because some of the indicators, such as information about households with a pc, or 16 17 18 89 mobile phone network coverage, are not freely available for the entire period analysed (2009 - 19 20 90 2013)."
4,the input data for the time series of the data poverty index proposed here is entirely 21 22 23 91 derived from freely available sources.
4,"the majority of the data sets used were obtained from 24 25 92 the world bank (world bank data-website, 2014), which provides data that are more up-to- 26 27 28 93 date than data from the united nations (un data-website, 2014)."
4,"the data poverty index has 29 30 94 five factors (figure 1): 31 32 95 o internet speed: (i) download and (ii) upload - a reliable and fast internet connection is 33 34 35 96 needed to download data; to share and/or upload data; to view or contribute to social 36 37 97 media and volunteered geographic information (vgi) initiatives, such as crowd- 38 39 40 98 source mapping (yin et al., 2012, yates & paquette, 2011, goodchild & glennon, 41 42 99 2010); the data was derived from the net-index website (http://www.netindex.com/) to 43 44 45 100 ensure politically independent data. 46 47 101 o (iii) internet users: - the percentage of individuals of a country using the internet."
4,"this 48 49 50 102 indicates the proportion of a national population familiar with the internet and how 51 52 103 many people who are likely to benefit from internet-delivered resources. 53 54 104 o (iv) mobile phone subscriptions (per 100 people): in some countries, particularly in 55 56 57 105 africa, mobile device usage is more widespread than internet usage, which should be 58 59 106 taken into account when developing social media and vgi applications or preparing 60 61 62 107 training materials."
4,subscriptions may also provide a measure of the potential of a 63 64 4 65
5,"108 country to get early warnings and contribute to disaster response efforts, for instance 1 2 109 following the haiti earthquake (yates & paquette, 2011). 3 4 5 110 o (v) education – derived from the tertiary education enrolment ratio (world bank data) 6 7 111 and the quotient of the number of universities in a country, relative to the population 8 9 10 112 of that country."
5,"this variable indicates the level of ‘computer literacy’ and hence 11 12 113 provides an indication of the understanding of geoinformatic data and technologies, 13 14 15 114 such as gis or gps."
5,16 17 115 factors such as the number of internet users and mobile phone subscriptions have been used 18 19 116 in indices before.
5,"for instance the un world risk index (2011-14), or the 2012 itu report 20 21 22 117 (itu, 2012) on measuring the information society."
5,"the 2012 itu report linked information 23 24 118 technology variables to national gross domestic product (gdp), rather than to the possibility 25 26 27 119 of a country accessing data for disaster preparedness or response."
5,"the itu report (itu, 2012) 28 29 120 and the world risk index (world bank, 2014) contain important variables, such as mobile 30 31 32 121 phone network coverage, or the percentage of insurance coverage."
5,"however, neither were 33 34 122 considered in the development of the dpi because those datasets are either not available 35 36 123 publicly, not freely available, or do not exist for the study period (2009 – 2013)."
5,"additionally, 37 38 39 124 the un world risk index (alliance development works, 2013) lacks normalisation for 40 41 125 reliable comparisons."
5,a basic statistical analysis of the relationship of the factors can be 42 43 44 126 found in leidig and teeuw (2015a).
5,45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 5 65
6,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 127 21 22 128 figure 1: data inputs used to calculate the data poverty index.
6,"23 24 129 for the calculation of the dpi time series, the input data was feature scaled (0-1) to provide a 25 26 27 130 comparable representation of the individual variables."
6,"the calculated data poverty factor was 28 29 131 subtracted from the maximum score of 5 to obtain values for the data poverty index: low 30 31 32 132 values indicating minor data poverty, high values signifying severe data poverty."
6,"33 34 133 internet upload speed limits the dissemination of information and data, the use of social 35 36 134 media and access to vgi initiatives."
6,"the maximum threshold for the internet speed/upload 37 38 39 135 category was set to 1 mbps: this is relatively low, but over the 5-year study period 1 mbps 40 41 136 was progressively reached by the majority of countries."
6,"the 1 mbps threshold is equivalent to 42 43 44 137 7.5 mb per minute, which would enable the upload of two to three 12 mega-pixel digital 45 46 138 pictures per minute."
6,"47 48 49 139 a download speed of at least 10 mbps, which equates to downloading a dvd (4.7 gb) in 50 51 140 60 minutes, has been allocated the highest score in the internet speed/download category, 52 53 54 141 enabling an objective comparison between countries."
6,"the internet speed score classes are 55 56 142 based on the authors’ experience with geoinformatic fieldwork, training and conferences in 57 58 143 many countries, from europe to africa, asia and the caribbean."
6,"that the thresholds for the 59 60 61 144 internet speeds are reasonable, is illustrated by the equipment of a major uk fire and rescue 62 63 64 6 65"
7,"145 service (hampshire: hfrs), which has a transmit and receive data rate of 492 kbps."
7,"hfrs 1 2 146 also uses the 2g gprs to 3g (hspa) wireless broadband standard, with a possible 7.2 mbps 3 4 5 147 of 3g, but that is rarely met during an emergency response: 2-3 mbps is typical."
7,"faster 6 7 148 wireless broadband, such as 4g, is currently not extensively used globally, due to insufficient 8 9 10 149 coverage and high costs."
7,"another major issue is slower speed in mobile networks because of 11 12 150 concurrent usage, which is common in emergency response situations."
7,13 14 15 151 the percentage of mobile phone subscriptions was used as a measure of a country’s 16 17 152 mobile device usage.
7,"it was not possible to incorporate more variables, such as the percentage 18 19 153 of network coverage, due to the absence of freely available data."
7,"20 21 22 154 the information about university provision was obtained from the world higher 23 24 155 education database (world higher education database, 2014) and gaps have been filled 25 26 27 156 using the 4icu.org website (2014)."
7,"the maximum number for the feature scaling was capped 28 29 157 at 10, which results in the top-scoring countries having at least one university per 100,000 30 31 32 158 people."
7,this was necessary to remove extreme values for small countries that have one 33 34 159 university for relatively few inhabitants (e.g.
7,san marino) and to ensure a reasonable 35 36 160 representation when comparing countries and the other variables.
7,"population and tertiary 37 38 39 161 education data from the world bank (world bank data-website) were used; gaps were filled 40 41 162 using united nations data (un data-website, 2014)."
7,42 43 44 163 no further weighting or ranking among the factors for the data poverty index was 45 46 164 applied.
7,"this decision is based on expert discussion, which indicated that such a weighting 47 48 49 165 introduces further subjectivity."
7,"for instance: the relative importance of a single variable 50 51 166 might vary from metric application to application (e.g. sustainable development, disaster 52 53 167 vulnerability)."
7,"internet speed could be very important for disaster response, but when it comes 54 55 56 168 to sustainable development or vulnerability reduction, education might play a more significant 57 58 169 role."
7,59 60 61 62 63 64 7 65
8,"170 the methodology provides data that are detailed enough to allow comparison and 1 2 171 differentiation among a wide range of countries, but it could also be modified for more 3 4 5 172 detailed analysis, such as the dpi values of districts within a given country."
8,"6 7 8 173 results 9 10 174 for 122 countries, for which adequate datasets are available, we have analysed a complete 11 12 13 175 multi-factor dataset to calculate the dpi time series from 2009 to 2013."
8,"for ease of 14 15 176 comparison we use the world bank income classification: high-income countries (hics), 16 17 177 upper-middle-income countries (umics), lower-middle-income countries (lmics) and low- 18 19 20 178 income countries (lics)."
8,the number of countries in each category with a complete dataset 21 22 179 unfortunately differs: high-income countries are more likely to have a complete dataset.
8,"of 23 24 25 180 the 122 complete datasets there are: 10 lics, 28 lmics, 33 umics and 51 hics."
8,"hence, 26 27 181 averages calculated for higher income countries are likely to be more reliable, having a lower 28 29 30 182 standard deviation, than poorer countries."
8,the extent to which countries in various regions 31 32 183 and continents contribute a complete dataset for the data poverty time series analysis is 33 34 35 184 indicated in table 1.

9,*1 the continent and regions classification used to present the dpi trends are based on the map references of the 1 cia world factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook).
9,"2 3 *2 the world bank lists, e.g. for the human development indicators (hdi), 214 countries and regions."
9,"the 4 united nations, e.g. the united nations statistics division, lists 241 countries and regions."
9,"since the majority 5 of data used to calculate the dpi was obtained from the world bank, the world bank country list was used in 6 7 this table."
9,greenland was not considered in the count for north america nor europe.
9,8 *3 countries of the middle east are listed with asia in un statistics 9 (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm) file and hence the above statistics uses the cia world 10 11 factbook for the discrimination.
9,12 13 185 table 1: overview of the countries per continent providing a complete dataset to calculate the data 14 15 186 poverty index time series.
9,"16 17 187 the missing data (table 1) to calculate the dpi might, on its own, be an indication of data 18 19 188 poverty."
9,"many reports dealing with global development assessments, put asia and oceania 20 21 22 189 into one category."
9,"in the classification used for this article, only three countries represent 23 24 190 oceania (australia, new zealand and papua new guinea)."
9,this might be misleading when 25 26 27 191 looking at trends (e.g.
9,"figure 5) because it indicates that for small island states in the pacific 28 29 192 region (and elsewhere, such as the caribbean) there is inherently limited data availability for 30 31 32 193 dpi analysis."
9,"however, there are few reasons not to merge the asia and oceania categories, 33 34 194 not least because the countries of those regions often differ significantly in size and 35 36 37 195 population."
9,countries or regions with missing data in europa are often small islands (e.g.
9,"38 39 196 faeroe islands or guernsey) or small territories and nations, such as gibraltar and the 40 41 197 vatican."
9,42 43 44 198 the box-whisker plots in figure 2 show that the dpi variation is generally decreasing: 45 46 199 the average dpi score is moving closer to the global average of the corresponding year.
9,"the 47 48 49 200 only exception among the hics is equatorial guinea, which has a dpi score within the range 50 51 201 of a low-income country."
9,"of the low-income countries, a noteworthy negative outliner, as of 52 53 54 202 2013, is burkina faso: it has very low dpi scores in every category, particularly the education 55 56 203 and internet variables."
9,"on the other hand, the 2013 dpi score of tajikistan is what we could 57 58 204 expect in an upper-middle income country."

10,61 62 63 64 10 65
11,210 figure 2 and figure 3 indicate that the average data poverty appears to be ever-decreasing in 1 2 211 each of the income categories.
11,"however, when the dpi values are normalised, by the 3 4 5 212 difference to the average global dpi of the corresponding year, data poverty is revealed as 6 7 213 steadily increasing in low-income countries."
11,"for lmics the data poverty is also steadily 8 9 10 214 increasing, though at a lower rate (figure 4)."
11,"the dpi trends observed for umics and hics 11 12 215 are decreasing, i.e. moving towards reduced data poverty, with hics approaching a potential 13 14 15 216 steady state condition - under the currently selected thresholds."
11,the complexity is further 16 17 217 emphasised when we examine the dpi results by looking at geographical regions rather than 18 19 218 the world bank income classification (figure 4).

13,"57 58 249 almost all hics have reached a high level of technological development, but improvements 59 60 61 250 are now predominantly possible by the incorporation of new technologies, such as new or 62 63 64 13 65"
14,"251 updated hardware, new mobile phone network standards (e.g. from gpsr to lte) or 1 2 252 improved internet protocols."
14,"3 4 5 253 the most prominent individual factors of the dpi are the internet speeds, along with the 6 7 254 number of internet users."
14,"in the 5-year period analysed, the educational variable contributes 8 9 10 255 least to the overall dpi score."
14,"however, it is education that differs most when comparing 11 12 256 high-income to low-income countries."
14,the effects of education on the uptake of information 13 14 15 257 and communication technology are discussed by van dijk (2006).
14,16 17 258 a summary of the global data poverty index change between 2009 and 2013 is presented 18 19 259 in figure 6.
14,"countries that already had a low dpi in 2009, tend to have improved less, relative 20 21 22 260 to countries with a higher dpi score."
14,to analyse developments in africa is challenging 23 24 261 because for 35 countries in africa there is no complete dataset for at least one of the years 25 26 27 262 considered in the analysis (table 1).
14,28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 263 46 47 264 figure 6: relative data poverty change between 2009 and 2013.
14,"48 49 265 50 51 52 266 discussion 53 54 267 previous studies dealing with the ‘digital divide’ contain few attempts to quantify and 55 56 268 moreover visualise data poverty, or they did not look on the global scale and instead focused 57 58 59 269 on one continent – often africa (ford, 2007, fuchs & horak, 2008)."
14,the challenge for 60 61 62 63 64 14 65
15,"270 promoting and practicing sustainable development, and to improve disaster resilience, is to 1 2 271 recognise which developments are favourable (barban et al., 2008)."
15,3 4 5 272 the dpi time series indicates the potential of annual monitoring to identify shortcomings 6 7 273 in information technology and communication infrastructure.
15,"unfortunately, there is 8 9 10 274 insufficient reliable and complete data before 2009 to extend the time series and check for 11 12 275 longer-term trends."
15,"the quasi steady-state conditions reached by many hics are likely to 13 14 15 276 remain for some years because improvements in rural areas are slow to implement, for 16 17 277 instance, with education or improved internet access."
15,"improvements in existing technology 18 19 278 and internet protocols (such as the recent introduction of http/2) may enhance the scores from 20 21 22 279 hics, but they are levelled by the thresholds that we introduced to make the dpi scores 23 24 280 comparable among the different nations and income classes."
15,25 26 27 281 the decreasing average dpi in asia from 2012 to 2013 might be due to the relatively 28 29 282 large number of disasters that hit asia during that period.
15,"according to the centre for 30 31 32 283 research on the epidemiology of disasters (cred), countries in asia reported 83 disasters in 33 34 284 2012, mostly floods."
15,"those disasters resulted in ca. 3,100 fatalities, affected 64.5 million 35 36 285 people and caused about us$15 billion in damage."
15,"china led the list of disaster frequency in 37 38 39 286 2012 (18), followed by philippines (16), indonesia (10), afghanistan (9) and india (5) (inrin 40 41 287 news, 2015)."
15,"these disasters adversely affected national infrastructure and industries, so it 42 43 44 288 may well be that ict features were also impacted, which is reflected in the dpi scores."
15,45 46 289 why is the dpi score of africa so much worse than the other continents?
15,"47 48 49 290 there are many possible factors, but it is notable that many african countries often focus 50 51 291 their economic development focuses on the exploitation of natural resources, rather than 52 53 292 investment in ict and higher education."
15,"africa also has relatively few submarine internet 54 55 56 293 cables, severely limiting its capacity to link with the global internet (primetrica inc. – tele 57 58 294 geography, 2014)."
15,some of the countries with the highest projected population growth rates 59 60 61 62 63 64 15 65
16,"295 are in africa (un data-website, 2014), resulting in an increasing number of potential users 1 2 296 being in competition for limited ict capabilities."
16,3 4 5 297 a ‘digital global community’ is nevertheless developing.
16,"the primary reason is the high 6 7 298 availability of mobile phones and the corresponding increasing mobile network coverage, 8 9 10 299 along with the high usage of mobile phones, even in developing countries (buys et al., 2009)."
16,"11 12 300 van dijk (2006) found that cultural, psychological and socio-economic aspects, such as how 13 14 15 301 to finance fees for ict and related hardware, are a hindrance in the development of digital 16 17 302 communities."
16,"however, such hindrances are secondary, not least where mobile networks or 18 19 303 internet connections are not available in the first place."
16,"20 21 22 304 given the increasing number of mobile devices (e.g. phones, tablets and laptops), some 23 24 305 studies concluded that the digital divide among individuals has increasingly been closing as 25 26 27 306 the result of an almost automatic process (compaine, 2001, dutton et al., 2004)."
16,"that 28 29 307 argument is further emphasised by the percentage of households with a computer: in 2004, 30 31 32 308 0.6% of households in india and about 60% of households in the usa had a personal 33 34 309 computer (chinn & fairlie, 2004)."
16,in 2013 12 % of households in india and 80% of 35 36 310 households in the usa had a personal computer.
16,"this is still a significant gap but indicates 37 38 39 311 the improvement on the example of a lower-middle income country (un data-website, 2014)."
16,"40 41 312 regarding the availability, access and consequent usage of digital networks, the 42 43 44 313 limitations are generally greater for the internet than for mobile phones."
16,"however, the 45 46 314 numbers for mobile phone users, might be over-estimates, due to the habit of sharing mobile 47 48 49 315 phones in the developing world – though recent fieldwork indicates that even in developing 50 51 316 countries the trend is towards at least one mobile phone per person (james, 2011)."
16,52 53 317 another important issue concerns ict skills and computer-literacy.
16,research shows that 54 55 56 318 the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by 57 58 319 providing the necessary equipment.
16,"three main factors are involved: information 59 60 61 320 accessibility, utilization and receptiveness."
16,people need to know how to make use of 62 63 64 16 65
17,"321 information and communication tools once they exist within a community (kim & kim, 1 2 322 2001)."
17,in the dpi calculation this is represented by the educational factor.
17,"compared to the 3 4 5 323 world risk report of the united nations (un university, 2014), we consider tertiary 6 7 324 education because universities are the institutions where a lot of research and training for 8 9 10 325 disaster preparedness is performed."
17,"11 12 326 the global digital divide describes global disparities, predominantly between developed 13 14 15 327 and developing countries, with regards to access to computing and information resources, 16 17 328 such as the internet and the opportunities derived from such access (lu, 2001)."
17,"the presented 18 19 329 dpi methodology could be downscaled, for instance to examine differences between cities 20 21 22 330 versus rural areas; or coastal plains versus mountainous regions."
17,"if the relevant input data 23 24 331 does not exist, it could be easily collected, for instance by using vgi (wesolowski et al., 25 26 27 332 2014, davidson, 2014, lüge et al., 2014, pakhare et al., 2013)."
17,"28 29 333 the amount of information and data freely available from the internet is expanding very 30 31 32 334 quickly (leidig & teeuw, 2015b, teeuw et.al, 2012)."
17,"however, not all countries are able to 33 34 335 keep up with the frequent technological changes - particularly developing countries."
17,"the term 35 36 336 ‘digital divide’ does not necessarily mean that someone does not have ict technology; it 37 38 39 337 could also mean that there are differences ict availability, such as the provision of high- 40 41 338 quality computers, fast internet, mobile network coverage, or limited technical assistance."
17,42 43 44 339 the trend towards a local minimum in europe and north america indicates that these 45 46 340 regions have reached a relatively good level of ict coverage.
17,"improvements those regions 47 48 49 341 are, in short term, mainly possible by improved technology or by further developing rural and 50 51 342 remote areas, which might take longer than the considered time series."
17,"since we are in a 52 53 343 dynamic system, a ‘perfect’ dpi score of 0 might not be possible."
17,this is further analysed on 54 55 56 344 the basis of the variables contributing to the dpi.
17,the contribution of each factor to the dpi 57 58 345 for the corresponding year is presented in figure 7.
17,"although there have been positive ict 59 60 61 346 developments in the study period, there is still a discrepancy i.e. in download speed between 62 63 64 17 65"
18,347 hics and lics – despite the fairly low and reasonable thresholds set.
18,that discrepancy can 1 2 348 have major impacts on disaster risk reduction because fast download speeds are needed for 3 4 5 349 effective early warning and for the supply of satellite imagery to guide disaster response.
18,"6 7 350 moreover, to be able to download and process data is one of the major requirements for the 8 9 10 351 application of the international charter on space and major disasters (danzeglocke, 2015)."
18,11 12 352 another major dividing factor is education; which is where hics and lics differ most.
18,13 14 15 353 the education factor scores have not changed significantly but have been slightly altered by 16 17 354 population growth.
18,the difference among hics and lics is by a factor of six (average hics 18 19 355 ~0.6 and average lics ~0.1).
18,"while the number of universities has not changed, based on the 20 21 22 356 available data, it might be possible that universities have grown with respect to the population 23 24 357 growth."
18,here further research and new metrics are needed to analyse such developments.
18,25 26 27 358 even an increase in tertiary education might not be an indication for progress but could also 28 29 359 indicate congested universities.
18,30 31 32 360 the contribution of the download speeds in lmics and umics is almost identical and 33 34 361 showed significant progress compared to lics in the considered time series with umics 35 36 362 disengaging from the lmics from 2012 to 2013.
18,"with regard to the contribution of mobile 37 38 39 363 phone subscriptions, hics and umics are almost on a par, and lmics are catching up; 40 41 364 however, it is encouraging that the contribution of this factor for lics has increased by 100% 42 43 44 365 (from 0.34 in 2009, to 0.68 in 2013)."
18,"in summary, the technology-based aspects in the dpi 45 46 366 (download speed, upload speed and mobile phone subscriptions) currently have a stronger 47 48 49 367 contribution to the dpi score, but education and the number of internet users are also 50 51 368 significant factors."
18,52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 18 65
19,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 369 42 43 370 figure 7: spider plots showing the contribution to the dpi for each factor and year.
19,44 45 371 the pursuit of sustainability assumes that we know what can be sustained and have the 46 47 48 372 capacity to maintain an equilibrium.
19,"in contrast, there is the concept of resilience, which 49 50 373 acknowledges disequilibrium and nonlinear change."
19,"with ‘resilience’, dynamics and 51 52 53 374 complexities are acknowledged, certainty is not required, and the emphasis is on adaptive 54 55 375 capacity and management, rather than stationary (benson & craig, 2014)."
19,dynamics and 56 57 58 376 complexity is what we observe with the dpi analysis.
19,"within the 5-year time frame of this 59 60 377 study, we have been unable to determine a ‘perfect’ dpi score for any of the countries 61 62 63 64 19 65"
20,378 examined.
20,1 2 379 the decrease of the global average dpi in each of the analysed years is a good sign.
20,"3 4 5 380 however, the gap between the dpi scores of the different income classes is currently 6 7 381 widening, rather than closing: the data-rich are getting richer and the data-poor are getting 8 9 10 382 relatively poorer."
20,"in particular, many african countries need investment in ict to improve 11 12 383 their capabilities in disaster management (from preparedness mapping, to early warning and 13 14 15 384 post-disaster response), as well as for addressing issues arising from climate change and rapid 16 17 385 population growth."
20,18 19 386 the thresholds set here to calculate the dpi are not absolute and are likely to require an 20 21 22 387 update in future.
20,with an ever-increasing amount of data there is also the requirement to move 23 24 388 more data.
20,"for instance, there is now a large amount of freely available, internet- 25 26 27 389 downloadable satellite remote sensing data, such as from nasa’s landsat or esa’s sentinel 28 29 390 sensors, that can be used for drr applications (krishnamoorthi, 2016, kotovirta et al., 2015, 30 31 32 391 schlaffer et al., 2015, teeuw et al., 2012)."
20,"however, it is worth noting that when switching 33 34 392 from using landsat-7 to landsat-8 remote sensing data (e.g. for regional land cover 35 36 393 monitoring), the size of a typical landsat scene increased by 40-50% - from about 680 mb to 37 38 39 394 1 gb."
20,fast internet connections are required to download and use such large-volume data: 40 41 395 countries with a high data poverty score face more challenges to access such data.
20,the dpi 42 43 44 396 provides a means of monitoring such capabilities.
20,"45 46 47 397 data poverty, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction 48 49 398 the world has experienced an increasing number and impact of disasters in the past decades."
20,"50 51 52 399 many regions, each with distinctive characteristics, are exposed to natural hazards."
20,"the main 53 54 400 causes for this increase can be attributed to a higher frequency of extreme hydro- 55 56 401 meteorological events, most likely related to climate change, and to an increase in the 57 58 59 402 exposure of vulnerable population (ipcc, 2007, van westen, 2013)."
20,60 61 403 the ict development of a country is clearly linked with its potential economic 62 63 64 20 65
21,"404 development (itu, 2012) and the dpi is suitable for monitoring national-scale ict and 1 2 405 higher education developments on an annual timescale."
21,"for disaster risk reduction and climate 3 4 5 406 change adaptation, the dpi can be utilised as a vulnerability monitoring tool (craig, 2010)."
21,"6 7 407 reporting the required data at district level, rather than as a national average, would enhance 8 9 10 408 the dpi analysis, for instance enabling monitoring of urban versus rural information access."
21,11 12 409 improved monitoring using the dpi requires more freely available data from all countries 13 14 15 410 and faster reporting of that data.
21,"however, as of mid-june 2015, apart from the internet speed 16 17 411 data (which are free data from a commercial company), no updated data for 2014 was 18 19 412 available online at the world bank website or the un statistics website when international 20 21 22 413 aid for ict development is provided, the dpi could serve as a useful tool for monitoring 23 24 414 progress: the data required to calculate the dpi should be a minimum requirement for 25 26 27 415 monitoring associated with international development funding."
21,"28 29 416 the world faces a future in which we humans are unsure of what we can sustain (milly et 30 31 32 417 al., 2007)."
21,"the resilience concept is a promising way of addressing the challenges ahead, 33 34 418 incorporating the dynamic and nonlinear change observed with the dpi (benson & craig, 35 36 419 2014)."
21,"whether we strive for sustainable development goals or aim to increase the resilience 37 38 39 420 of communities and countries, the dpi is a suitable tool for monitoring development, in 40 41 421 conjunction with other methods of global risk analysis, such as the world risk index 42 43 44 422 (alliance development works, 2013) and the global assessment reports of the united 45 46 423 nations (2015)."
