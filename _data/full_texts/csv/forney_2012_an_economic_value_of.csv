66,"56 an economic value of remote-sensing information—application to agricultural production and maintaining groundwater quality appendix 2—nitrogen cycle the nitrogen cycle is the cycle in which organic nitrogen is mineralized, plants uptake the mineralized nitrogen, and eventually the nitrogen is returned to the soil in residues."
66,nitrate is highly mobile in the soil and subsurface.
66,"note that there are a number of other sources and processes at work, where soil organisms are the driving force for reactions in the cycle."
66,"the five primary paths of nitrate in the nitrogen cycle are (1) synthesis or immobilization by microorganisms, (2) removal through plant uptake by way of roots, (3) leaching into the groundwater system, (4) volatilization into the atmosphere from the land surface, and (5) re-entry into the atmosphere from the subsurface through denitrification."
66,"without considering the usage of nitrification inhibitors, soil conditions, timing of application, and other surface and residue management techniques, commercial fertilizers have been shown to lose from ~0 percent to as much as 50 percent of their nitrogen through volatilization of ammonia (peoples and others, 1995), and—depending on air flow rate, temperature, soil cation exchange capacity, ph and method of application—applied manure can volatilize 21 to 27 percent (westerman and others, 1985)."
66,"denitrification is often considered the last step of the nitrogen cycle, as it is the major process that returns nitrogen gas (n2) to the atmosphere (schlesinger, 1997)."
66,"the general, four distinct steps of facultative anaerobes completing denitrification are: no3ˉ→no2ˉ →noˉ →n2o→n2 ."
66,"(23) depending on the electron donors, degree of oxygen present, substrates, and other site conditions, more specific character- ization of biological denitrification can be described by either heterotrophs that gain energy from carbon oxidation, autotrophs that gain energy from sulfide oxidation, or iron oxidation; all result in the reduction of nitrate (no3-) and the associated byprod- ucts of n2 and others such as sulfate, iron in two valance states, water, and bicarbonate."
66,"in addition to the presence of electron donors, factors known to influence denitrification rates include low topographic positions, shallow water tables and high mois- ture content, acidity17, more anaerobic sites, unfractured geologic zones, and clay-rich sediments (rovang and simpkins, 2001)."
66,"under conditions of snowmelt and rainfall runoff, wetlands have been shown to allow the infiltration of water and transport it laterally outside of the reducing, anoxic environment more often than transporting it vertically to the degree of only 1 percent of precipitation recharged to zones of anoxic till (keller and others, 1991; schuh and others, 1997)."
66,"because of solubility and mobility of nitrates in water, once nitrates enter the saturated zone below the water table, the ions are relatively persistent and dispersive."
66,"however, if highly anaerobic conditions and an electron donor exist, nitrate concentrations can be reduced by denitrification in groundwater before drinking water is extracted from wells (canter, 1997)."
66,"measuring denitrification is difficult because of its high spatial variability; however, soil texture has been shown to be correlated with denitrification and is considered one of the more reasonable proxies for regional estimates of denitrification (groffmand and tiedje, 1989)."
66,"considering the importance of landscape position, riparian buffers between agricultural fields and stream courses have been shown to be produc- tive denitrifying zones (hanson and others, 1994; peterjohn and correll, 1984)."
66,"although all of these factors and drivers of the nitrogen cycle are not necessarily included in our model, it is important to note their potential influence in our results."
66,"17 note that high acidity—which can be increased by fertilizers or manures laden with ammonia (nh3)—will result in reduced denitrification and the produc- tion of nitrous oxide (n2o), which can deleterious influence the atmosphere as a powerful greenhouse gas, a stratosphere ozone depletor, and contribute to the formation of acid rain (brady and weil, 2002; schlesinger, 1997)."
67,"appendix 3—kriging of hydraulic conductivity 57 appendix 3—kriging of hydraulic conductivity kriging is a geospatial technique for interpolating values for a variable in an unobserved location using neighboring point observations (webster and oliver, 2007)."
67,"the kriging method was developed by matheron (1963, 1967)."
67,this method was introduced to study complex hydroscience systems by delhomme (1978).
67,"regression kriging (rk) was introduced by odeh and others (1994, 1995)."
67,"in addition to the spatial autocorrelation used in the ordinary kriging method, rk includes both the environmental autocorrelation and spatial autocorrelation to interpolate variables for unobserved locations."
67,the rk involves kriging the variable using a regression estimator with environmental (hydrogeological) variables that have a neighborhood trend.
67,the prediction uncertainties are then included by incorporating the regression errors into the kriged variables.
67,"hydraulic conductivity (hc) depends on hydrogeological properties of an aquifer18, suggesting environmental and spa- tial autocorrelation could matter."
67,"therefore, an attempt was made to krige hc surfaces using regression kriging."
67,the hc was regressed using combinations of transformed variables and the best estimation of a log-log regression equation for reducing wide ranging quantities to smaller ranges.
67,"for the rk technique, the regression equation for the all aquifers in the study region is: inhc =β1 + β2 ineb + β3 inth + β4 inaq + ε , (24) where β is the estimate of the coefficient, eb is the base elevation of the aquifer, th is the thickness of the aquifer, aq the type of aquifer, and ε is the regression remainder."
67,table 13 provides the variables and their parameter estimates.
67,the hc regression layer was created using the arcgis spatial analyst tool (fig.
67,the residuals are kriged (fig. 25) and added to the regression- estimation-kriged layer to obtain the final kriged layer (fig. 26) for the variable hc.
67,"thus, a spatially interpolated hc surface was used to derive hc values for the wells without hc information for the purposes of delineating capture zones (czs) for a larger number of wells."

67,"18 during the course of the analysis, it was noted that geologic faults bisected the silurian aquifer."

72,"geological survey scientists modeled the rela- tions among land uses, agricultural production, and dynamic nitrate (no3-) contamination of aquifers in the northeastern iowa study region."
72,corn is a primary crop of iowa and is used in biofuels such as ethanol.
72,iowa produc- es about 30 percent of the nation’s ethanol.
72,agricultural production often includes heavy application of nitrogenous fertilizer that can affect ground- water quality.
72,"in this study, the u.s."
72,geological survey demonstrated the value of information (voi) from remote sensing by using improved agricultural production and nitrate-leaching estimates enabled by earth-observing satellites.
72,"as compared to the situation without satellite information, these estimates can provide additional benefits to society through more optimal allocation of production without sacrificing public health and groundwa- ter quality in an agricultural region."
72,"in iowa, groundwater pumped from aquifers, and often stored in water towers, is used as the source for drinking water by as many as 80 percent of residents."
72,"for this application in northeastern iowa, the marginal benefit of the voi (in 2010 dollars) is estimated to be $858 million ± $197 million per year, which cor- responds to a net present value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits into the foreseeable future."
