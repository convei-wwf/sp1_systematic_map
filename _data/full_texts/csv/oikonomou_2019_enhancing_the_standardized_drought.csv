1,"the vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to sivakumar, associate editor water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation."
1,"the standardized keywords: drought vulnerability index (sdvi) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based drought on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and drought vulnerability the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability."
1,this work attempts to drought impacts evolve the sdvi by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the sdvi combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of water resources south platte drought related information.
1,"at the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept."
1,"the new framework is applied in the south platte basin, within colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (july-september)."
1,the proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers.
1,sdvi could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts.
1,"thus, it is believed that the sdvi could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach."
1,"introduction the attention of the scientific community, the state and federal entities, as well as the general public, resulting in the production of a rich menu drought is a recurrent natural phenomenon aggressive in many of drought literature that mostly provides crucial information on its areas around the world defying their normal climatic conditions (kiem parameters and management strategies (cancelliere et al., 2005; et al., 2016)."

1,"damages due to drought can be costlier 2015a, 2015b; loukas and vasiliades, 2004; playán et al., 2013; than any other natural hazard (loucks, 2006)."
1,"early on, rosenberg pulwarty and maia, 2015; rosenberg, 1978, 1980; traore and fontane, (1980) stresses that vulnerability to drought in one water user group, 2007; vasiliades and loukas, 2009; vlachos, 1982; wilhite, 2004; zarch has a ripple effect to the society at large."

2,"therefore, drought vul- index (vicente-serrano et al., 2010), and the multivariate drought nerability assessment in high spatial resolution could serve as an ad- index (rajsekhar et al., 2015); whereas, other more complex ones are ditional water resources management tool informing managers and referring directly or indirectly to vulnerability and water scarcity con- planners on an area for priority actions. cepts (jain et al., 2015; karavitis et al., 2014; sullivan, 2002; vargas the employment of indicators and indices is a common practice for and paneque, 2017). describing complex phenomena and concepts."
2,"the standardized the concept of vulnerability to drought is very challenging to be drought vulnerability index (sdvi) was conceived as an integrated accurately presented due to a disciplinary and/or individually based approach for assessing drought vulnerability (karavitis et al., 2014), series of interpretations (gallopín, 2006)."
2,thywissen (2006) and with a multi-component drought vulnerability characterization based manyena (2006) also provide extensive lists of various definitions of on a classification system.
2,it was produced during the drought man- vulnerability.
2,"nevertheless, the vulnerability concept mostly refers to agement centre in southeastern europe (dmcsee) project (karavitis the components affecting both a system’s capacity to cope and its po- et al., 2011, 2012b, 2014)."
2,"the present effort is attempting to surpass tential to be harmed, and it is strongly influenced by a plethora of some of the sdvi’s earlier application limitations and assess the in- factors (cardona et al., 2012; jain et al., 2015; karavitis et al., 2014). formation improvement provided by the integration of satellite data in turner et al. (2003) defines vulnerability as the likelihood to experience the calculation of sdvi."
2,"this is accomplished by introducing a more harm due to exposure to hazard and encompasses exposure, sensitivity transparent, data rigorous methodology that replaces qualitative in- and resilience to the concept."
2,"according to ipcc, vulnerability is de- formation with more quantitative data."
2,"the enhancement of the sdvi to fined as “the propensity or the predisposition to be adversely affected”, accurately depict occurring conditions in space and time is essential for and is the result of “diverse historical, social, economic, political, cul- the index utilization as an efficient, timely and effective decision tural, institutional, natural resource, and environmental conditions and making tool in water resources planning and management under processes” (lavell et al., 2012)."
2,"under this framework, vulnerability, drought conditions."
2,"better understanding of the vulnerability to the natural hazard, and the exposure to it, are related through the risk drought and its different contributing components could convey of an extreme event."
2,"the vulnerability term could also be expressed as a drought information for mitigation and adaptation strategies to deci- function of two variables, namely; hazard and impacts (karavitis et al., sion makers in a more holistic manner."
