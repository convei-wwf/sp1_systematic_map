2,"the important sources of information for environmental benefits strongly depend, however, on the (perceived) accuracy resource management."
2,"with budgets for earth observation of the information system and the current beliefs regarding (eo) increasingly under pressure, it is important to be able uncertain parameters of the decision environment (i.e. the ‘state to quantify the returns to informational investments."
2,"for of the world’). this, a clear analytical framework is lacking."
2,this paper attempts to develop and test such a framework by the structure of the paper is as follows.

2,the case results and concludes. studies indicate that the main benefits of eo are increased spatial and temporal coverage of the existing monitoring 2.
2,methodology system and generation of early warning predictions.
2,"the we base our analytical framework on a seminal paper by results suggest that the expected benefits of eo investments hirshleifer and riley (1979) regarding the value of information are positive, but that they strongly depend on the under uncertainty."
2,"when decision-making takes place in an (perceived) accuracy of the information system. uncertain environment, decision-makers have to act upon their keywords: societal benefits of earth observation; bayesian beliefs regarding the possible ‘states of the world’."
2,the states of decision theory; expert elicitation; marine water quality the world may be something like “it will rain” or “it will remain management; coral reef management; dry” and decision-makers attach a certain probability “πs” to each expected state of the world (σπs=1).
2,when the pay-off (or 1.
2,"introduction utility) of an action (e.g. “take an umbrella”) depends on the state of the world (“rain/dry”), decision makers are assumed to information is valuable for decision-making."
2,"although this base their decision on the expected pay-offs of the alternative seems a rather obvious statement, the economic value of actions (the sum of pay-offs for any state of the world times its information for decision-making is seldom addressed."
2,"this probability). might not be a problem with sufficient investments in informational services, but explicit attention for the value of the role of information is that it gives a message “m” about the information is required if too little, or too much, investment in state of the world."
2,the message is not always accurate (think of information is made.
2,"at present, experts argue that investment a weather forecast), but the decision-maker has an idea of the in global eo is insufficient (ec, 2007)."
2,"hence, it seems accuracy of the message, i.e., the probability of the message important to assess what the optimal investment level would be. being right."
2,"based on the message the decision-maker can “update” her beliefs about the state of the world and, possibly, there are few studies that have attempted to estimate the value change her decision."
2,the value of information depends on a) the of eo information.
2,macauley (2006) discusses the potential extent to which the decision-maker updates her beliefs and b) benefits of eo but does not empirically assess them.
2,"other the impact this has on the expected pay-off of decision-making. papers use rather ad-hoc methods for assessing eo benefits, and a formal way of expressing the process of belief updating is generally lack an analytical framework (see bouma et al. 2009 reflected in the well-known bayes’ theorem: for an overview)."
2,"this paper develops an analytical framework for assessing the pr(m | s ) pr( s ) q m, s π s economic benefits of eo information, by combining bayesian π s ,m = pr( s | m) = = (1) decision theory with an expert elicitation approach."
2,"bayesian pr(m) qm decision theory studies decision-making under uncertainty, and with πs,m the posterior probability, or the updated belief, πs the how information is used to update beliefs regarding uncertain prior probability, or the belief before the additional information, parameters of the decision environment (hirshleifer and riley qm,s the conditional probability of receiving message m given 1979)."
2,"by combining bayesian decision theory with expert state s (the likelihood of receiving message m given state s), and elicitation, we empirically assess the influence of eo qm the unconditional probability of receiving informational investments on decision-makers beliefs. message m."
2,"the unconditional probability of receiving message to quantify the benefits of eo information and test the m is related to the conditional probabilities by: empirical feasibility of our approach we consider two case s studies: a) potentially harmful algal blooms in the north sea qm = ∑ qm,sπ s (2) and b) water quality management in the great barrier reef s =1 (gbr) lagoon."
3,to assess the extent to which the decision-maker uses the information to update her beliefs we need to know a) the decision-maker’s prior belief and b) the perceived accuracy of the informational message.
3,we can then estimate the impact on the expected pay-off of decision-making.
3,"for this, we compare the pay-off of the action chosen given message m (xm) and the action that would have been chosen without additional information (x0): ∆ m = u ( xm , π s , m ) − u ( xo , π s ,m ) (3) as the decision-maker does not know in advance which message the information service will produce, the expected value of the information service is the expected difference in 1) how would you estimate the probability that with the pay-offs given the likelihoods of receiving messages m (qm): existing monitoring system potentially harmful algal bloom is discovered in time?"
3,"(%) ∆ (µ ) = ∑ q m [u ( x m , π s ,m ) − u ( xo , π s ,m )] (4) 2) how would you estimate this probability when use is m made of additional satellite observations?"

3,"although their empirical application is very figure 1 example of questionnaire questions interesting in a number of respects (and our approach draws heavily on their work), they consulted only one decision-maker."
3,"before presenting the results of the questionnaire, we need to bouma et al. (2009) combined the schimmelpfennig and norton know what pay-offs an updated belief about the state of the approach with a survey instrument to elicit beliefs from a larger world could have."
3,"thus, for each case study we constructed a group."
3,"assuming that decisions on informational investments pay-off matrix of alternative actions and possible states of the are non-strategic and consensus-based, collecting information world."
3,we assumed that pay-offs for public decision-makers from a larger group increases outcome robustness.
3,in the next would equal impacts on social welfare.
3,we derived information section we elaborate our approach. about potential welfare impacts from the literature.
3,in the following we present the two pay-off matrices.
3,"empirical approach and case studies as argued in the preceding paragraph, belief updating is 3.1 case study 1: algal blooms in the north sea determined by prior beliefs and the perceived accuracy of in 2001, excessive algal blooms caused a loss of approximately information."
3,information about prior beliefs can be derived 20 million euro to the dutch mussel cultivation sector from the literature or deduced from actual decision-making.
3,"(peperzak, 2003)."
3,"if early warning information would have been information about the perceived accuracy of the information is available, this loss could have been avoided by preventively not readily available, and we developed a questionnaire to relocating mussel cultivation plots at 10% of the damage costs collect this information."
3,"in the questionnaire, we ask in fact, in 2006 an early warning system became operational for respondents to compare a situation with and without eo the near-real time early detection and forecasting of algal information and to express what they perceive the (remaining) blooms in dutch coastal waters, using a combination of field uncertainty of decision-making to be."
3,"in addition, we asked data, satellite observations and hydrodynamic- and biological questions about the perceived accuracy of eo information and modelling (woerd et al., 2008)."
3,the system can detect rapid the respondent’s background. rises in chlorophyll-a levels during bloom formation.
3,"on the basis of these observations a transport model makes predictions fig. 1 presents an example from the questionnaire, developed to about the transport of the bloom, 5 days (or a week) ahead. assess the benefits of eo for predicting harmful algal blooms in the north sea."
3,"to facilitate comparison between the present the decision-making problem is whether in a given week information system and the system with additional eo fishing nets should be relocated (action x1) or not (action x2). investment, we used eo images."
3,"in both case studies, eo was the time period considered is a week since the information not part of the existing monitoring system yet."
3,"we sent the system makes weekly predications and we assume decision- questionnaires to (senior) policy-makers, water managers and makers minimally need a week to relocate mussel stocks. experts with expertise in eo and the decision-making problem concerned."
3,the north sea questionnaire was sent to 23 with regard to the prior beliefs concerning the probability of respondents of which 80% replied.
3,"of this 80%, half answered harmful algal blooms in the dutch part of the north sea, in the most questions."
3,"the great barrier reef questionnaire was sent questionnaire respondents unanimously indicated that they to 70 respondents, of which 40% replied."
3,"of this 40%, almost expected that potentially harmful algal blooms, like the one in all answered most questions."
3,"in fact, the great barrier reef 2001, would take place every 5 years."
3,"since in the netherlands questionnaire was sent to a smaller group of respondents with a potentially harmful algal blooms are only possible during a more specialized background, because we learned from the period of 10 weeks, there is a probability of 2% per week of north sea questionnaire that those with little background in eo potentially harmful algal blooms taking place."

4,"regional targets are based using these numbers to assess the value of eo information, we on historical increases in sediment, nutrient and pesticide loads estimate the value of potentially harmful algal bloom (gbrmpa 2001), as it is unclear which are the most polluting predictions to be 74,000 euro/week."
4,accounting for respondent catchments.
4,"eo information is expected to reduce this variability, the 95% sensitivity interval ranges from 34,000 to uncertainty by increasing insight into the spatial and temporal 103,000 euro/week."

4,"basically, there are two ‘states of the world’: s1) there is no in the case of water quality monitoring in the gbr lagoon the spatial variability in the effectiveness of emission reduction, and story is more complex."
4,"first of all, no eo cost data are s2) there is spatial variability in the effectiveness of emission available, so we do not know what the minimum level of reduction."
4,decision-makers are uncertain whether they should benefits should be.
4,"second, we have to assume prior beliefs take action x1) to reduce emissions across all catchments, or based on actual decision-making."
4,"given that decision-makers action x2) to reduce emissions from selected catchments only. are currently choosing action x1, reduce emissions in all we estimate the costs of the great barrier reef water quality catchments, the expected utility of action x1 should exceed the action plan to be approximately 1.1 billion usd/year."
4,this expected utility of action x2.
4,this is the case when the estimate is based on per unit cost estimates of roebeling et al. probability of state 1 is 72%.
4,using this value and the estimated (2007).
4,"for estimating the costs of action x2, we follow type-i and type-ii errors presented earlier, the value of eo mckergow et al (2005) who argue that most of the sediment would be 52.1 million usd/year. comes from two catchments and that targeting interventions to however, changing the prior belief estimate also changes the these regions is most effective."
4,"measures to reduce nutrient value of information: if we instead assume a prior belief in state emission are most effective in the wet tropical regions of the 1 of 80%, the value of information reduces to 21.2 million gbr (devlin and brodie 2005)."
4,"thus, fewer interventions usd/year."
4,"although it is difficult to say what the value of prior would be required, and the costs of x2 would be approximately belief should be, the analysis shows in accordance with 600 million usd/year."
4,"finally, if interventions are targeted but hirshleifer and riley (1979) that the more convinced decision- there is no spatial variability, more measures are required in the makers are of their current policy, the lower the perceived value selected catchments to reach the same environmental effect. of eo."
4,"roebeling et al (2007) show that this reduces cost-effectiveness, increasing total costs to approximately 1.3 billion usd/year."
4,"finally, the value of information is determined by its perceived accuracy."
4,fig 2 below illustrates this for the north sea case 4.
4,results study.
4,"as fig 2 shows, algal bloom early warning information the results for the north sea case study show that, on average, only has value if the perceived type-ii error is less than 20%. respondents expect that eo will improve marine water quality turning this argument around, by improving the accuracy of eo monitoring and that it will reduce uncertainty with roughly information its value could increase to 350,000 euro/week."

4,"the respondents could 70%, the value of eo could become 82 million usd/year. not indicate the probability of a false alarm (type-ii error), so we assumed a type-ii error of 10%."
