1,"in this paper, we provide guidance to help data providers and intermediaries within the eo value chain (from data to applications) increase the societal value of the eo data, information, and data products that they work with."
1,we first describe the eo value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit.
1,we then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the eo value chain.
1,"finally, we present “10 rules” that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of earth science information."
1,"the 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions."
1,"some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole."
1,each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points.
1,"the rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection of solutions."
1,"the next set of rules are best applied throughout a project, and include such concepts as evaluation, interoperability, trust, adoption, and documentation."
1,"finally, the last rule addresses the challenge of determining when to close a project."

2,"these approaches (a, b, and c in fig. 1) are defined by the existence of data, a value chain, and/or the eo value chain users, and how well these three elements are aligned."

2,"the main challenge with this approach is upwards, when data are given meaning, such as through that the users may simply not exist, or the products are not models or analyses, they are transformed into information that usable by or useful for a targeted user group."
2,users are often people can use.
2,"information is packaged into “products” (e.g., sought from an “audience”, which includes all people solutions, tools, and services) that address specific purposes. and groups with a potential interest in the data products the application of these products can become integrated into a (baker et al."
