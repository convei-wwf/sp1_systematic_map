7,"baseline routes contained an average of 16.6 km of impacted roadway (df + dhf ), while the avoidance routes by definition encountered no highly flooded areas (figure 7b), and contained an average of 8.7 km of flooded roadway."
7,the response times for the baseline and avoidance routes showed similar distributions.
7,"baseline routes results had lower minimum and maximum response times than the corresponding avoidance routes, yet the median, mean (expected), and third quartile response times of the avoidance routes were lower than the baseline counterparts (figure 8)."
7,"when evaluating for the expected response time over each uncertain sow, routes that avoided the highly flooded regions (and thereby much of the flooded region as well), were on average ∼9 min faster."

9,"we find that emergency response times are highly while the results presented here demonstrate the potentially dependent on the detected flood inputs, as well as the high value of applied satellite information, the analysis has relationship between estimated inundation depths and some notable caveats and limitations."
9,one such limitation is the vehicle speeds.
9,when accounting for parametric uncertainties resolution and availability of the data used to generate the flood and evaluating for model objectives over different route detection and impact analysis.
9,"because time is a critical factor in combinations, we find that routes which circumvent any emergency response situation, modis imagery was selected the most impacted regions (i.e., highly flooded) also to produce the flood detection due to its fast revisit time (twice avoid additional flooded regions, resulting in shorter daily) and low latency (∼3 h)."
9,an important tradeoff is that the expected response times.
9,"the social value of these earth imagery is only of moderate resolution (250-m) and is unable observations, particularly when evaluated in the context to penetrate cloud cover, making it not as suited for applications of potential lives saved, can be on the order of millions of requiring high-resolution flood maps."
9,future implementations of dollars annually. the analysis could feasibly utilize any flood extent—regardless of the sensor used to generate it—providing that imagery is available immediately following the event.
9,the impact assessment portion of the analysis also includes non-trivial uncertainties.
9,"depth estimates were generated using the merit dem, which improves on many of the sources of error in other global elevation datasets (e.g., vegetation biases, striping, and speckling), yet still has significant errors in vertical accuracy (yamazaki et al., 2017)."
9,"the use of open-source materials, including the openrouteservice routing platform and infrastructure data from openstreetmap provide important benefits for accessibility and scalability, yet they often present the challenge of being incomplete and potentially inconsistent."
9,"therefore, the socioeconomic damage map used to identify the potential population sites (supplementary figure 1) also has associated uncertainties."
9,"despite this, we find that the provisional damage estimates can still be instructive for identifying areas that may be most highly impacted [for more detail, see the discussion section 5.2—damage estimate validation in oddo et al."
9,(2018)].
9,another broad limitation of this analysis is how it models the complex geophysical and behavioral dynamics inherent in a real-world disaster response scenario.
9,the flood extent used here is currently treated as static.
