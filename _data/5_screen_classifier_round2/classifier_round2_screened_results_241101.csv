Remote Sensing Products And Services In Support Of Agricultural Public Policies In Africa: Overview And Challenges,"In the last decade, governments, international institutions, donors, the private sector, etc. have shown a renewed interest in agricultural issues in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This interest came with a strong need for information in countries where the lack of reliable and timely basic information can be a problem. Thanks to its capacity to observe the Earth at local, regional, and global scales and from various vantage points, satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to streamline the monitoring and improvement of the existing systems, and thus to support decision-making. However, the path from satellite images to public policy decisions is not straightforward, and today, only few operational information services are available in SSA countries (e.g., early warning systems for food security and desert locust plagues prevention, rangeland production forecasting). This paper aims to analyze the gap between the technical aspects of the remote sensing sciences and the pragmatic need for relevant data to address agricultural policies in Africa and produce operational recommendations. To achieve this goal, the authors (1) determine the information, and in particular the geoinformation, needed to develop, implement and evaluate agricultural public policies (2) illustrate the role of remote sensing as a public policy tool in SSA through an overview of the current off-the-shelf products and services derived from Earth Observation systems, and (3) propose an analysis of the existing gap between the remote sensing research community and the policy makers. Based on this review, the authors conclude that to benefit from this technological advancement and bridge the gap between technical analysts and policy makers, some key points are fundamental: capacity building, political will and institutional commitment, public-private partnership, and proofs of concept.",NA,NA,10.3389/fsufs.2020.00058,{},included,NA
"Quantitative Assessment Of Soil Condition, Basic Environmental Factors And Productivity Of Linum Usitatissimum In The Steppe Zone Of Kazakhstan Using The Remote Sensing Method","The influence of environmental factors, such as lack of water and uneven rainfall, depletion of nutrients in the soil and reduced soil fertility, planting patterns and plant density, uneven growth stages, are the main limiting factors that hinder the growth of agricultural production in arid regions. The aim of the study was to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 to quantify soil conditions, which can improve the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics in organic agriculture in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan and improve productivity management of Linum usitatissimum. In the course of the research, the influence of individual factors of the general environmental impact, such as the influence of humidity, meteorological conditions, the content of individual nutrient components of the soil on the yield, was studied. The meteorological conditions in this region in 2021 and the data of agrochemical analysis of the soil on which the oilseed crop was grown were evaluated. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to determine the NDVI and GNDVI indices. A high content of nitrate nitrogen (12.3-16.2 mg/kg), a very low level of available phosphorus (3-10 mg/kg), and a high content of potassium (289-420 mg/kg) were found in the soil. A low content of humus (2.68-3.31%) and sulfur (1.1-4.9 mg/kg) was found. A study of the NDVI growth index showed that the highest value was reached by the period of July 20, 2021. After this period, a decrease in the vegetation index was observed. In conditions of severe drought, this change occurred earlier than under favorable conditions, and correlated with low flax yield (1.6-6.9 c/ha). This study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 for quantifying soil conditions, which not only improves our understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics and environmental components in organic agriculture in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan, but also improves the management of Linum usitatissimum productivity.

A Real Options Approach To Satellite Mission Planning,"Satellite missions are one instrument of Earth observation targeted at obtaining information for improved decision making in sustainable development. But satellite missions are expensive undertakings involving large sunk costs and facing uncertain benefit streams. In the area of avoiding damages through, for example, better weather forecasts or better-informed rescue missions, the benefits are high, but also difficult to quantify. Using real options to optimize the timing of the launch of a satellite enables us not only to optimize the timing of the mission, but also to derive the value that such information conveys when it can be used to reduce the extent of the damage from disasters and their consequences: with low benefit expectations or large uncertainty, launching will be postponed, so ex ante Earth observation benefit assessment is an important task.

Space-Based Earth Observations For Disaster Risk Management,"As space-based Earth observations are delivering a growing amount and variety of data, the potential of this information to better support disaster risk management is coming into increased scrutiny. Disaster risk management actions are commonly divided into the different steps of the disaster management cycle, which include: prevention, to minimize future losses; preparedness and crisis management, often focused on saving lives; and post-crisis management aiming at re-establishing services supporting human activities. Based on a literature review and examples of studies in the area of coastal, hydro-meteorological and geohazards, this review examines how space-based Earth observations have addressed the needs for information in the area of disaster risk management so far. We show that efforts have essentially focused on hazard assessments or supporting crisis management, whereas a number of needs still remain partly fulfilled for vulnerability and exposure mapping, as well as adaptation planning. A promising way forward to maximize the impact of Earth observations includes multi-risk approaches, which mutualize the collection of time-evolving vulnerability and exposure data across different hazards. Opportunities exist as programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinels are now delivering Earth observations of an unprecedented quality, quantity and repetitiveness, as well as initiatives from the disaster risk science communities such as the development of observatories. We argue that, as a complement to this, more systematic efforts to (1) build capacity and (2) evaluate where space-based Earth observations can support disaster risk management would be useful to maximize its societal benefits.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10712-020-09586-5,{},included,NA
The Role Of African Emerging Space Agencies In Earth Observation Capacity Building For Facilitating The Implementation And Monitoring Of The African Development Agenda: The Case Of African Earth Observation Program,"AU-Agenda 2063 was adopted at the 24th Ordinary Session of the African Heads of State and Government in 2015 as the blueprint for the future development of the continent. Built upon the continent's past experiences, challenges, and successes, AU-Agenda 2063 comprehensively describes the strategic path for Africa's future development in the next 50 years. Thus, the monitoring of its implementation in various African states is critical for ensuring sustainable development and track progress. However, the higher cost of collecting data for accurately and reliably monitoring the implementation of Agenda 2063 may hinder the progress towards achieving these goals. Satellite Earth observation provides ample data, and thus has provided opportunities for the development of novel products and services with the potential to support implementation, monitoring and reporting for AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. However, it has been limitedly exploited in Africa, as evidenced by lower research outputs and investments. This calls for increased capacity building in the use of available EO data and products for various users including decision makers to advance national, regional and continental priorities. The use of such data products is often hampered by the capability to understand the products and thus their value for addressing socio-economic challenges. This paper discusses the potential of Earth observation capacity building for supporting the implementation, monitoring of, and reporting towards achieving AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. Specifically, this paper identifies existing capacity building resources, including the role of open and free Earth observation data, open-source software, and product dissemination platforms that can be leveraged for supporting national development, service delivery and the achievement of AU-Agenda 2063 targets. Furthermore, the paper recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships in leveraging existing know-how, technology and other resources for advancing strategic goals of African emerging space agencies and promoting sustainable development, with examples from South African National Space Agency (SANSA). Then, the challenges and opportunities for capacity building and the wide adoption of EO in Africa are discussed in the context of AU-Agenda 2063. The paper thus concludes that EO capacity building is essential to address the skills and data gaps and increase the use of EO-based solutions for decision making in various sectors, critical for achieving AU-A2063.",NA,NA,10.3390/ijgi8070292,{},included,NA
Research Needs,"This chapter focuses on how environmental policies affect international trade flows and examines how changes intrade policy affect the environment. Most economists agree that environmental problems are conceptually the same as negative externalities. They arise because control rights for resource attributes are not fully allocated. In the literaturethat examines the effects of environmental policy on trade, most empirical results suggest that there is much ado about nothing. New data sources need to be exploited. Satellite images provide a potentially rich source for economic analysisof the environment. They have the advantages of providing data from the early 1970s to the present, and being geo-referenced. There has been a tendency in the literature to theorize about existence and site values rather than to use accepted social cost-benefit techniques to quantify more readily measurable and less controversial external costs.

The Utility Of Historical Aerial Photographs For Detecting And Judging The Effectiveness Of Rangeland Remediation Treatments,"Aerial photographs are a type of remote sensing data that are especially valuable for rangeland applications. Advantages of these data include relative ease of interpretation and acquisition, affordability, high resolution (1-2 meters), and provision of a common reference for communication among those involved in rangeland management. Additionally, air photos are especially well suited for analysis of historical rangeland remediation treatments because acquisition of widespread aerial photographic coverage began during the 1930s. Several types of treatments can be easily identified and monitored over time, including contour terraces, brush water spreaders, rootplow seeding, water ponding dikes, shrub removal by grubbing, and grazing restrictions. The use of archived aerial photographs allows the opportunity to recreate the management history of rangeland, as well as to serve as a point of departure for involvement in more sophisticated satellite-based remote sensing systems.

Mapping Spatial Pattern In Biodiversity For Regional Conservation Planning: Where To From Here?,"Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations, distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping, derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.",NA,NA,10.1080/10635150252899806,{},included,NA
Drone Remote Sensing For Forestry Research And Practices,"Drones of various shapes, sizes, and functionalities have emerged over the past few decades, and their civilian applications are becoming increasingly appealing. Flexible, low-cost, and high-resolution remote sensing systems that use drones as platforms are important for filling data gaps and supplementing the capabilities of crewed/manned aircraft and satellite remote sensing systems. Here, we refer to this growing remote sensing initiative as drone remote sensing and explain its unique advantages in forestry research and practices. Furthermore, we summarize the various approaches of drone remote sensing to surveying forests, mapping canopy gaps, measuring forest canopy height, tracking forest wildfires, and supporting intensive forest management. The benefits of drone remote sensing include low material and operational costs, flexible control of spatial and temporal resolution, high-intensity data collection, and the absence of risk to crews. The current forestry applications of drone remote sensing are still at an experimental stage, but they are expected to expand rapidly. To better guide the development of drone remote sensing for sustainable forestry, it is important to systematically and continuously conduct comparative studies to determine the appropriate drone remote sensing technologies for various forest conditions and/or forestry applications.

The Role Of Satellite Telemetry Data In 21St Century Conservation Of Polar Bears (Ursus Maritimus),"Satellite telemetry (ST) has played a critical role in the management and conservation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) over the last 50 years. ST data provide biological information relevant to subpopulation delineation, movements, habitat use, maternal denning, health, human-bear interactions, and accurate estimates of vital rates and abundance. Given that polar bears are distributed at low densities over vast and remote habitats, much of the information provided by ST data cannot be collected by other means. Obtaining ST data for polar bears requires chemical immobilization and application of a tracking device. Although immobilization has not been found to have negative effects beyond a several-day reduction in activity, over the last few decades opposition to immobilization and deployment of satellite-linked radio collars has resulted in a lack of current ST data in many of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations. Here, we review the uses of ST data for polar bears and evaluate its role in addressing 21(st) century conservation and management challenges, which include estimation of sustainable harvest rates, understanding the impacts of climate warming, delineating critical habitat, and assessing potential anthropogenic impacts from tourism, resource development and extraction. We found that in subpopulations where ST data have been consistently collected, information was available to estimate vital rates and subpopulation density, document the effects of sea-ice loss, and inform management related to subsistence harvest and regulatory requirements. In contrast, a lack of ST data in some subpopulations resulted in increased bias and uncertainty in ecological and demographic parameters, which has a range of negative consequences. As sea-ice loss due to climate warming continues, there is a greater need to monitor polar bear distribution, habitat use, abundance, and subpopulation connectivity. We conclude that continued collection of ST data will be critically important for polar bear management and conservation in the 21(st) century and that the benefits of immobilizing small numbers of individual polar bears in order to deploy ST devices significantly outweigh the risks.",NA,NA,10.3389/fmars.2022.816666,{},included,NA
Incorporation Of Satellite Remote Sensing Pan-Sharpened Imagery Into Digital Soil Prediction And Mapping Models To Characterize Soil Property Variability In Small Agricultural Fields,"Soil prediction models based on spectral indices from some multispectral images are too coarse to characterize spatial pattern of soil properties in small and heterogeneous agricultural lands. Image pan-sharpening has seldom been utilized in Digital Soil Mapping research before. This research aimed to analyze the effects of pan-sharpened (PAN) remote sensing spectral indices on soil prediction models in smallholder farm settings. This research fused the panchromatic band and multispectral (MS) bands of WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Landsat 8 images in a village in Southern India by Brovey, Gram-Schmidt and Intensity-Hue-Saturation methods. Random Forest was utilized to develop soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil exchangeable potassium (Kex) prediction models by incorporating multiple spectral indices from the PAN and MS images. Overall, our results showed that PAN remote sensing spectral indices have similar spectral characteristics with soil TN and Kex as MS remote sensing spectral indices. There is no soil prediction model incorporating the specific type of pan-sharpened spectral indices always had the strongest prediction capability of soil TN and Kex. The incorporation of pan-sharpened remote sensing spectral data not only increased the spatial resolution of the soil prediction maps, but also enhanced the prediction accuracy of soil prediction models. Small farms with limited footprint, fragmented ownership and diverse crop cycle should benefit greatly from the pan-sharpened high spatial resolution imagery for soil property mapping. Our results show that multiple high and medium resolution images can be used to map soil properties suggesting the possibility of an improvement in the mapsâ update frequency. Additionally, the results should benefit the large agricultural community through the reduction of routine soil sampling cost and improved prediction accuracy.

Evaluating Nox Emission Inventories For Regulatory Air Quality Modeling Using Satellite And Air Quality Model Data,"The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of NOx emissions in the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) State Implementation Plan (SIP) modeling inventories of the southeastern U.S. We used retrieved satellite tropospheric NO2 columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) together with NO2 columns from the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) to make top-down NOx emissions estimates using the mass balance method. Two different top -down NOx emissions estimates were developed using the KNMI DOMINO v2.0 and NASA SP2 retrievals of OMI NO2 columns. Differences in the top-down NOx emissions estimates made with these two operational products derived from the same OMI radiance data were sufficiently large that they could not be used to constrain the TCEQ NOx emissions in the southeast. The fact that the two available operational NO2 column retrievals give such different top-down NOx emissions results is important because these retrievals are increasingly being used to diagnose air quality problems and to inform efforts to solve them. These results reflect the fact that NO2 column retrievals are a blend of measurements and modeled data and should be used with caution in analyses that will inform policy development. This study illustrates both benefits and challenges of using satellite NO2 data for air quality management applications. Comparison with OMI NO2 columns pointed the way toward improvements in the CAMx simulation of the upper troposphere, but further refinement of both regional air quality models and the NO2 column retrievals is needed before the mass balance and other emission inversion methods can be used to successfully constrain NOx emission inventories used in U.S. regulatory modeling.

Role Of Irs-1c In Developing Remote Sensing Applications For Water Management In India,"Efficient water management is essential for water and food security leading to socio-economic development. In order to build resilience and achieve water security, planning and management of water resources projects needs to be based on realistic assessment of related aspects. This requires comprehensive, reliable and easily accessible information on demand, availability and utilisation of water resources. Observational capabilities from ground monitoring systems and supplementary/complementary data from satellite remote sensing provide unique opportunities for data integration and value addition supporting water management decisions. While LANDSAT-1 initiated various remote sensing based activities with respect to management of hydrology and water resources across the globe, the launch of Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1A in 1988, along with its follow-up satellites, provided fillip to these activities mainly in India. The launch of IRS-1C in December 1995, with unique combination of sensors, has greatly improved extensive utilisation of satellite remote sensing for various facets of water management. This article presents a review of various applications carried out using IRS-1C data while highlighting the capabilities and advantage of IRS-1C sensors achieving significant improvement in mapping water bodies, inventory and monitoring of irrigated crops, irrigation system performance evaluation, assessment of reservoir sedimentation, mapping and monitoring of snow cover, snowmelt runoff forecasting, watershed developmental planning and management, etc.",NA,NA,10.1007/s12524-020-01280-8,{},included,NA

Research On Monitoring And Environmental Control Of Farmland Operation Based On Multi-Sensor Data Fusion,"Because traditional methods fail to accurately obtain environmental sensing data, resulting in poor farmland operation monitoring performance and low agricultural production efficiency, the impact of farmland operation monitoring technology on environmental regulation is proposed. The adaptive fusion method is introduced to fuse the collected farmland environmental data to make the multi-sensor data fusion result optimal. The soil temperature, humidity, oxygen, carbon dioxide and plant height environmental data acquisition sensors are activated to obtain field environmental sensing data, and determine the function keys based on the early warning value and time value. Adjustments were made to the farmland environment based on the judgment results with focus on the environmental control of farmland operation monitoring technology impact. The experimental results show that after the introduction of farmland operation monitoring technology, the accuracy of farmland environment monitoring is higher and the error of farmland environment regulation is lower, which meets the basic needs of users.

"The Potential Of Remote Sensing Data For Decision Makers At The State, Local And Tribal Level: Experiences From Nasa's Synergy Program","NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) satellite data are contributing to the development of policy relevant, remote sensing applications. To promote the use of EOS data for application development, NASA funded the Synergy program in 2000 in partnership with academia, end users, and industry. Three examples of remote sensing applications from the Synergy program are presented here and include agriculture, range management, and water resource management. These examples show that remote sensing products have the potential to be useful to a variety of decision makers and policy makers because of the opportunity to reduce chemicals in the environment, improve crop yields and better manage range lands and water resources. Transitioning from research and development to successful applications must overcome challenges such as the lack of awareness by end users of these technologies, inadequate feedback mechanism between application developers and end users, and unproven cost benefits of remote sensing data. Experience from the Synergy program indicates that these issues could be mitigated by educating and training end users, demonstrating the utility of remote sensing data in improving decision making, and establishing and maintaining a continuous dialogue between developers and end users. Sustainability of remote sensing applications ultimately depends on users continuing reliance on products and benefits from remote sensing data. The Synergy program also demonstrates that remote sensing data sets that are collected primarily for global change research contribute to the development of applications in a variety of disciplines at the regional and local level.

Public Health Benefits From Improved Identification Of Severe Air Pollution Events With Geostationary Satellite Data,"Despite improvements in ambient air quality in the US in recent decades, many people still experience unhealthy levels of pollution. At present, national-level alert-day identification relies predominately on surface monitor networks and forecasters. Satellite-based estimates of surface air quality have rapidly advanced and have the capability to inform exposure-reducing actions to protect public health. At present, we lack a robust framework to quantify public health benefits of these advances in applications of satellite-based atmospheric composition data. Here, we assess possible health benefits of using geostationary satellite data, over polar orbiting satellite data, for identifying particulate air quality alert days (24hr PM2.5Â >Â 35Â Î¼gÂ mâ3) in 2020. We find the more extensive spatiotemporal coverage of geostationary satellite data leads to a 60% increase in identification of person-alerts (alert daysÂ ÃÂ population) in 2020 over polar-orbiting satellite data. We apply pre-existing estimates of PM2.5 exposure reduction by individual behavior modification and find these additional person-alerts may lead to 1,200 (800â1,500) or 54% more averted PM2.5-attributable premature deaths per year, if geostationary, instead of polar orbiting, satellite data alone are used to identify alert days. These health benefits have an associated economic value of 13 (8.8â17) billion dollars ($2019) per year. Our results highlight one of many potential applications of atmospheric composition data from geostationary satellites for improving public health. Identifying these applications has important implications for guiding use of current satellite data and planning future geostationary satellite missions. Â© 2024 The Authors.

Use Of Remote Sensing In Control Of Good Agricultural And Environmental Conditions On Agricultural Farms,"In the frame of EU common agricultural policy, applicant farmers shall receive subsidies for agricultural production. A producer receiving payments is required to meet the basic requirements for the maintenance of all farmland in good agricultural conditions consistence with environmental protection. Since 2009, applicant farmer is obliged to comply with standards adopted by Poland in the so-called cross-compliance requirements. Member States shall determine at the national level for Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC). Compliance with these standards, to maintain good agricultural practice is controlled selectively in the annual inspection campaigns conducted by the Agency for Restructuring and Modernization of Agriculture (ARMA). One of control method is Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS), method that involves the determination in satellite or aerial images boundaries of areas subject to subsidies. Experience in the use of remote sensing, however, indicate the potential for the use of processed satellite or air orthophotomaps not only for cropping delineation but also to verify certain elements of agricultural practices. During the CwRS routine, one could indicate a possible non-compliance issues directly on the image and thereby optimize the process of control. The studies indicated which of the requirements to maintain land in good agricultural conditions might be monitored with CwRS. The results of the series of experiments showed that both kind of aerial and satellite orthophoto can be consider as equivalent materials. Features or phenomenon spread over a large area or occurred point-wise are detectable in image easier than during field inspection. Also wherever access or visibility on the ground is limited due to the morphology complexity, road network, etc., orthophotomap provide better angle of view. Nevertheless, the ratio benefit/cost for managing the entire control on national level should be checked against the efficiency of field control.",NA,NA,10.2478/ecoq-2013-0018,{},included,NA
Potential Of Virtual Earth Observation Constellations In Archaeological Research,"Earth observation sensors continually provide datasets with different spectral and spatial characteristics, while a series of pre- and postprocessing techniques are needed for calibration purposes. Nowadays, a variety of satellite images have become accessible to researchers, while big data cloud platforms allow them to deal with an extensive number of datasets. However, there is still difficulty related to these sensors meeting specific needs and challenges such as those of cultural heritage and supporting archaeological research world-wide. The harmonization and synergistic use of different sensors can be used in order to maximize the impact of earth observation sensors and enhance their benefit to the scientific community. In this direction, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has proposed the concept of virtual constellations, which is defined as ""a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the Earth system"". This paper provides an overview of existing and future earth observation sensors, the various levels of interoperability as proposed by Wulder et al., and presents some preliminary results from the Thessalian plain in Greece using integrated optical and radar Sentinel images.

We provide a systems analysis and design of the SEMAT remote monitoring units and the back-end data management system. The systemâs value is augmented through a unique e-waste recycling and repurposing model which engages/educates the community in the production of the SEMAT units using social enterprise. SEMAT serves as an open standard for the community to innovate around to further the state of play with low-cost environmental monitoring.

Acquisition Of Earth Science Remote Sensing Observations From Commercial Sources: Lessons Learned From The Space Imaging Ikonos Example,"Over the last decade, NASA and other federal agencies have been increasingly encouraged to explore commercial sources of land remote sensing data rather than pursuing government-funded sources of these measurements (prior to U.S. Commercial Executive, 2003. U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis. Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys. To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations. The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

Monitoring Daily Evapotranspiration Over Two California Vineyards Using Landsat 8 In A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion Approach,"California's Central Valley grows a significant fraction of grapes used for wine production in the United States. With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, it is critical to be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014. The system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with a multi-scale ET retrieval algorithm based on the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation to compute daily ET at 30 m resolution. In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, similar to 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19-23\% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d(-1)), reducing to 14-20\% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (similar to 5 mm wk(-1)). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at field-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops.

Evaluating The Public Value Of Improving Early Detection Accuracy Of Cumulonimbus Using A Geostationary Satellite In South Korea,"The Cheollian Satellite 2A called Geo-Kompsat-2A is a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by Korea Meteorological Administration for weather and space-weather observation purposes. This article seeks to evaluate the public value arising from improving the accuracy of early detection of cumulo-nimbus using Geo-Kompsat-2A. To this end, an economic technique called contingent valuation (CV) is adopted taking a three step approach. In step 1, a CV questionnaire was prepared for deriving the willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement. In step 2, a nationwide survey of 1000 households was conducted using the CV questionnaire and employing person-to-person interviews with household visits. In step 3, the average WTP was estimated. The yearly household average WTP was KRW 2143 (USD 1.91), securing statistical significance. Adjusting this value to suit the entire population of South Korea produces a yearly public value of KRW 44.1 billion (USD 39.3 million). Although it is not easy to accu-rately evaluate the costs involved in the improvement, the results of conducting a pilot cost-benefit analysis suggest that the improvement secures social desirability.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

"Experiences From Near-Real-Time Satellite-Based Volcano Monitoring In Central America: Case Studies At Fuego, Guatemala","Over the past decade, remote sensing has been used increasingly in the study of active volcanoes and their associated hazards. Ground-based remote sensing techniques, such as those aimed at the analysis of volcanic gases or fumarole temperatures, are now part of routine monitoring operations with additional satellite-based remote sensing methods. It is likely that the use of satellite-based systems will be most beneficial for volcano monitoring in developing country regions and remote areas. In such situations, an operational real-time satellite remote sensing system could provide rapid assessment of volcanic activity levels and potentially be used to derive crucial information for disaster prevention. This would allow key at-risk areas to be rapidly and appropriately targeted. An operational test of such a system has been carried out in the past 3 years in Central America, based on local reception and analysis of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Here we analyse the performance and data quality for recent activity of Fuego volcano (Guatemala). We assess the ability of the system to detect, quantify and monitor periods of heightened activity and consider the benefits of such information being available in near-real time to local geoscientists and for hazard mitigation. We show that the system is able to detect significant changes in volcanic activity (November and December 2004, February and December 2005). There are good comparisons for these events with large-scale monitoring systems using additional remote sensing data. This paper provides one of the few evaluations of the direct application of operational AVHRR data to volcanic hazard monitoring and disaster management in developing countries.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431160802168301,{},included,NA
Runoff Estimation In The Upper Reaches Of The Heihe River Using An Lstm Model With Remote Sensing Data,"Runoff estimations play an important role in water resource planning and management. Many accomplishments have been made in runoff estimations based on data recorded at meteorological stations; however, the advantages of the use of remotely sensed data in estimating runoff in watersheds for which data are lacking remain to be investigated. In this study, the MOD13A2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation (P), MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST), MOD16A2 evapotranspiration (ET) and hydrological station data were used as data sources with which to estimate the monthly runoff through the application of a fully connected long short-term memory (LSTM) model in the upstream reach of the Heihe River basin in China from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that inputting multiple remote sensing parameters improved the quality of runoff estimation compared to the use of rain gauge observations; an increase in R-2 from 0.91 to 0.94 was observed from the implementation of this process, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) showed an improvement from 0.89 to 0.93. The incorporation of rain gauge data as well as satellite data provided a slight improvement in estimating runoff with a respective R-2 value of 0.95 and NSE value of 0.94. This indicates that the LSTM model based on remote sensing data has great potential for runoff estimation, and data obtained by remote sensing technology provide an alternative approach for estimating runoff in areas for which available data are lacking.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14102488,{},included,NA

Using Publicly Available Satellite Imagery And Deep Learning To Understand Economic Well-Being In Africa,"Accurate and comprehensive measurements of economic well-being are fundamental inputs into both research and policy, but such measures are unavailable at a local level in many parts of the world. Here we train deep learning models to predict survey-based estimates of asset wealth across similar to 20,000 African villages from publicly-available multispectral satellite imagery. Models can explain 70\% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries where the model was not trained, outperforming previous benchmarks from high-resolution imagery, and comparison with independent wealth measurements from censuses suggests that errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Satellite-based estimates can also explain up to 50\% of the variation in district-aggregated changes in wealth over time, with daytime imagery particularly useful in this task. We demonstrate the utility of satellite-based estimates for research and policy, and demonstrate their scalability by creating a wealth map for Africa's most populous country.",NA,NA,10.1038/s41467-020-16185-w,{},included,NA
"Remote Sensing For The Study, Protection And Conservation Of Cultural Heritage: The Experience Of Itaca Mission In Southern America (2007-2013)","The importance of applying remote sensing to archaeological research has been paid great attention worldwide, due to the following aspects: (i) the improvement in spectral and spatial resolution reveals increasing detailed information for the detection of archaeological features; (ii) the development of remote sensing data processing approaches in the context of GIS help us to manage the complexity of archaeological investigations at a variety of different scales; (iii) the availability of different sensors available for remote sensing activities (LiDAR, SAR, optical, georadar, geomagnetometry, etc.) allows to obtain several information for different purposes, from site detection to documentation up to risk analysis. Moreover, archaeologists are ever more aware of the benefits of remote sensing applications for their investigations, such as: i) maps and profiles of existing and potential sites without extensive excavation; ii) reduction of costs, time and risk associated with archaeological excavation; iii) creation of site strategies, conservation, preservation; iv) assessment of the integrity of historical structures useful for their conservation. The result is the development of a scientific culture based on the interdisciplinarity and integration of knowledge, essential for applications in the field of cultural heritage. An example of such culture is the Italian heritage Conservation and Archaeo-geophysics (ITACA) Mission. It applies different scientific methodologies which rely on the most advanced Earth Observation technologies, to contribute to the study of the pre-Columbian civilizations and the cultural heritage conservation and management in Southern America. This paper mainly deals with three case studies in Peru and in Bolivia investigated by means of the integration of satellite, airborne and ground remote sensing in the context and to the support of typical archaeological investigations, from field survey to excavations. Such approach has allowed, in two cases, to support archaeological research, revealing important findings, in the third case, to map and observe the phenomenon of illegal excavations which represent one of the main risks affecting the archaeological heritage in Southern America.

"Artisanal Exploitation Of Mineral Resources: Remote Sensing Observations Of Environmental Consequences, Social And Ethical Aspects","Since the rise of the gold price in 2000, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a growing economic activity in developing countries. It represents a source of income for several millions of people in West Africa. Exploitation techniques have evolved from traditional gold panning to mechanization and use of chemical products that are harmful for the environment. Government strategies to control and regulate this activity are impeded by the difficulties to collect spatial information, due to the remote location and the mobile and informal natural of ASGM. Here we present and discuss the value of remote sensing techniques to complement the knowledge on artisanal mining impacts, including for detection of illegal sites, the evaluation of the degradation of soils and waters, the deforestation and the monitoring of expansion of ASGM with time. However, these techniques are blind regarding gender issues, labor relations, mobility, migration, and insecurity and need to be considered with knowledges from other disciplines. Remote sensing is also instilled with various powers accruing to those enabled to produce and interpret these data. Remote sensing should be therefore used in a reflexive manner that accounts for the social, ethical and political implications of ASGM governance informed by space observations.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10712-022-09740-1,{},included,NA

Satellite Remote Sensing For Water Resources Management: Potential For Supporting Sustainable Development In Data-Poor Regions,"Water resources management (WRM) for sustainable development presents many challenges in areas with sparse in situ monitoring networks. The exponential growth of satellite based information over the past decade provides unprecedented opportunities to support and improve WRM. Furthermore, traditional barriers to the access and usage of satellite data are lowering as technological innovations provide opportunities to manage and deliver this wealth of information to a wider audience. We review data needs for WRM and the role that satellite remote sensing can play to fill gaps and enhance WRM, focusing on the Latin American and Caribbean as an example of a region with potential to further develop its resources and mitigate the impacts of hydrological hazards. We review the state-of-the-art for relevant variables, current satellite missions, and products, how they are being used currently by national agencies across the Latin American and Caribbean region, and the challenges to improving their utility. We discuss the potential of recently launched, upcoming, and proposed missions that are likely to further enhance and transform assessment and monitoring of water resources. Ongoing challenges of accuracy, sampling, and continuity still need to be addressed, and further challenges related to the massive amounts of new data need to be overcome to best leverage the utility of satellite based information for improving WRM.",NA,NA,10.1029/2017wr022437,{},included,NA
Nasa's Early Adopter Program Links Satellite Data To Decision Making,"As the cost of satellite missions grow, government agencies are working to increase the relevance and usefulness of the Earth science data that they produce. The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) early adopter program seeks to formalize partnerships with users of data early within the satellite planning process to ensure the greatest value of the mission. Scientists who are designing the satellite observing system, those who are developing mission data products, and the community who will use them need to work together to determine how satellite data can better inform decision making. NASA is working to initiate engagement with data users much earlier in the satellite program life so that the user needs can be prioritized, continue to engage with users throughout the development cycle, and then include analysis on societal impact after nominal mission life. The Early Adopter Program allows for broad and early engagement with decision makers by encouraging individuals and institutions with clear uses of data to engage with the mission. Early adopters facilitate feedback on mission products during pre-launch and accelerate the utilization of these products post-launch. This paper provides background and detail on how NASA is working to engage with early adopters, describes the partnership between early adopters and NASA missions, and connects the program to improved societal impacts of its satellite missions.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11040406,{},included,NA
Scenarios For Valuing Sample Information In Natural Resources,"Uncertainty is ubiquitous in natural resource systems, science and management. Sample data are obtained in order to reduce uncertainty, thereby increasing knowledge and improving resource management, but sampling always comes at a cost of some sort. Is that cost worthwhile? Analysis of the value of sample information (VSI) addresses this question. In this paper we develop the valuation of sample information in terms of five elements: (a) asystemwhose attributes are the focus of analysis; (b) a range of managementactionsthat affect the system's status; (c)uncertaintyabout system status or structure, as characterized by initial (prior) probabilities of possible system states or structures; (d) anexperimentor other information source that produces new data points and updated (posterior) probabilities; and (e) avalue measurethat is a function of the management action taken, conditional on either the system state or structure. We describe five scenarios for analysing theVSIunder uncertainty about system structure and state. Scenarios 1-3 comprise analyses of conditional, expected and optimal expected values of sample information. They focus primarily on choice of management adaptations with new information. Scenarios 4 and 5 involve pre-selected management actions, and are useful for comparing designs of data collection rather than for choosing a management action. These last scenarios expand the framework forVSIto include actions that have been selected independently of the updating of uncertainty. We discuss other extensions ofVSIanalysis, which include spatial applications, hybrid scenarios, applications involving dynamic systems, and a focus on costs rather than net benefits. Value of sample information analysis holds promise in emerging areas of ecology such as ecological forecasting and the use of remote sensing in conservation, where potential new data from models and satellites can be evaluated in advance, thereby allowing more efficient prioritization of scientific efforts. More generally,VSIcan contribute to better ecological understanding and more effective management in a wide range of ecological situations.",NA,NA,10.1111/2041-210x.13487,{},included,NA
"Use Of Uav Or Remotely Piloted Aircraft And Forward-Looking Infrared In Forest, Rural And Wildland Fire Management: Evaluation Using Simple Economic Analysis","Background: Investment in emerging technologies may contribute to a reduction in the suppression costs of wildfires, and is thus worth careful consideration and trialling by researchers and managers. This investigation looked at the potential incorporation of a newly emerging remote sensing technology, remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared investigated using a cost-benefit analysis approach. Methods: An online survey-based approach targeting subject matter experts in wildland fire management and unmanned aircraft was used to evaluate the percentage change in the effectiveness of five different management scenarios using remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared. The most commonly accepted economic model in wildland fire management was adapted to determine the net value change between the five scenarios. Results: The benefits of incorporated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared were measured as the reduction in cost-opportunity of helicopter use, and were estimated as an average of \$548 per fire (where the average cost of fires was \$1767) or a 31 \% cost saving on total suppression costs. The return on investment of such technology was estimated at 24 fires, whereas the return of investment of the existing thermal camera/helicopter use occurred after 160 fires. Conclusions: The incorporation of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared if implemented and managed appropriately, could well improve the cost effectiveness of the current forest, rural and wildland fire fighting efforts. The inherent uncertainty on such unevaluated technology (the combination of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared) was addressed by adding stochastic variability and a triangular probability distribution approximation. Key management issues and recommendations are identified such as; greater use of current thermal camera equipment where possible, taking a project management based approach for further testing of remotely piloted aircraft and other emerging technologies, and the improved financial recording and reporting of fire management efforts.",NA,NA,10.1186/s40490-015-0044-9,{},included,NA
Integrating Research Using Animal-Borne Telemetry With The Needs Of Conservation Management,"1. Animal-borne telemetry has revolutionized our ability to study animal movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing environments and the threats that animals are experiencing. While there will always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to make informed management decisions. 2. Here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal telemetry devices can influence conservation. We then discuss two critical questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied conservation decision-making: (i) Would my choice of action change if I had more data? (ii) Is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect more data? 3. Policy implications. To answer questions about integrating telemetry-derived data with applied conservation, we suggest the use of value of information analysis to quantitatively assess the return-on-investment of animal telemetry-derived data for conservation decision-making.",NA,NA,10.1111/1365-2664.12755,{},included,NA
Satellite Remote Sensing As A Tool In Lahar Disaster Management,"At least 40,000 deaths have been attributed to historic lahars (volcanic mudflows). The most recent lahar disaster occurred in 1998 at Casita volcano, Nicaragua, claiming over 2,500 lives. Lahars can cover large areas and be highly destructive, and constitute a challenge for disaster management. With infrastructure affected and access frequently impeded, disaster management can benefit from the synoptic coverage provided by satellite imagery. This potential has been recognised for other types of natural disasters, but limitations are also known. Dedicated satellite constellations for disaster response and management have been proposed as one solution. Here we investigate the utility of currently available and forthcoming optical and radar sensors as tools in lahar disaster management. Applied to the Casita case, we find that imagery available at the time could not have significantly improved disaster response. However, forthcoming satellites, especially radar, will improve the situation, reducing the benefit of dedicated constellations.",NA,NA,10.1111/1467-7717.00197,{},included,NA
Air Quality Management Using Modern Remote Sensing And Spatial Technologies And Associated Societal Costs,"This paper presents a study of societal costs related to public health due to the degradation of air quality and the lack of physical activity, both affected by our built environment. The paper further shows road safety as another public health concern. Traffic fatalities are the number one cause of death in the world. Traffic accidents result in huge financial loss to the people involved and the related public health cost is a significant part of the total societal cost. Motor vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents as well as natural sources emit nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are precursors to the formation of ground-level Ozone. High concentration values of ground-level Ozone in hot summer days produce smog and lead to respiratory problems and loss in worker's productivity. These factors and associated economic costs to society are important in establishing public policy and decision-making for sustainable transportation and development of communities in both industrialized and developing countries. This paper presents new science models for predicting ground-level Ozone and related air quality degradation. The models include predictor variables of daily climatological data, traffic volume and mix, speed, aviation data, and emission inventory of point sources. These models have been implemented in the user friendly AQMAN computer program and used for a case study in Northern Mississippi. Life-cycle benefits from reduced societal costs can be used to implement sustainable transportation policies, enhance investment decision-making, and protect public health and the environment.

Space Assets For Demining Assistance,"Populations emerging from armed conflicts often remain threatened by landmines and explosive remnants of war. The international mine action community is concerned with the relief of this threat. The Space Assets for Demining Assistance (SADA) undertaking is a set of activities that aim at developing new services to improve the socio-economic impact of mine action activities, primarily focused on the release of land thought to be contaminated, a process described as land release. SADA was originally initiated by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). It has been implemented under the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) program of the European Space Agency (ESA). Land release in mine action is the process whereby the demining community identifies, surveys and prioritizes suspected hazardous areas for more detailed investigation, which eventually results in the clearance of landmines and other explosives, thereby releasing land to the local population. SADA has a broad scope, covering activities, such as planning (risk and impact analysis, prioritization, and resource management), field operations and reporting. SADA services are developed in two phases: feasibility studies followed by demonstration projects. Three parallel feasibility studies have been performed. They aimed at defining an integrated set of space enabled services to support the land release process in mine action, and at analyzing their added value, viability and sustainability. The needs of the mine action sector have been assessed and the potential contribution of space assets has been identified. Support services have been formulated. To test their fieldability, proofs of concept involving mine action end users in various operational field settings have been performed by each of the study teams. The economic viability has also been assessed. Whenever relevant and cost-effective, SADA aims at integrating Earth observation data, GNSS navigation and SatCom technologies with existing mine action tools and procedures, as well as with novel aerial survey technologies. Such conformity with existing user processes, as well as available budgets and appropriateness of technology based solutions given the field level operational setting are important conditions for success. The studies have demonstrated that Earth observation data, satellite navigation solutions and in some cases, satellite communication, indeed can provide added value to mine action activities if properly tailored based on close user interaction and provided through a suitable channel. Such added value for example includes easy and sustained access to Earth observation data for general purpose mapping, land use assessment for post-release progress reporting, and multi-source data fusion algorithms to help quantify risks and socio-economic impact for prioritization and planning purposes. The environment and boundaries of a hazardous area can also be better specified to support the land release process including detailed survey and clearance operations. Satellite communication can help to provide relevant data to remote locations, but is not regarded as strongly user driven. Finally, satellite navigation can support more precise non-technical surveys, as well as aerial observation with small planes or hand-launched UAV's. To ensure the activity is genuinely user driven, the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) plays an important role as ESA's external advisor. ESA is furthermore supported by a representative field operator, the Swiss Foundation of Mine Action (FSD), providing ESA with a direct connection to the field level end users. Specifically FSD has provided a shared user needs baseline to the three study teams. To ensure solutions meet with end user requirements, the study teams themselves include mine action representatives and have interacted closely with their pre-existing and newly established contacts within the mine action community.

"Monitoring Forest Canopy Cover Change With Icesat-2 Data In Fire-Prone Areas: A Case Study In Antalya, TÃ¼rkiye","This study presents an innovative approach for monitoring forest canopy cover changes in Antalya, Turkey, a region characterized by rich biodiversity, recurrent forest fires, and rapid rehabilitation efforts. Employing advanced remote sensing techniques, the research integrates ICESat-2 ATL08 segment data, Landsat satellite imagery, and Esri Sentinel-2 Land Cover datasets to generate forest canopy cover (FCC) maps for the years 2019 and 2022. The study area was chosen due to its high population, significant tourism industry, and frequent forest fires, making it a critical region for biodiversity and forest resources in Turkey. The Canopy Cover Estimation Method (CCEM) was employed, achieving accuracy percentages ranging from 77% to 86%, demonstrating its efficacy in estimating FCC without the need for fieldwork. The integration of annual updates from the Esri Sentinel-2 Land Cover dataset as auxiliary data greatly enhanced the reliability and accuracy of the analyses. Despite challenges posed by the study area and differences in spatial resolution among the datasets, the study successfully demonstrated the utility of integrating ICESat-2 segment data and Landsat imagery for understanding the dynamics of FCC in a complex environment. The results contribute to more informed decision-making in forest management and conservation efforts. Future research should focus on refining the methodologies to minimize spectral misclassification, improving the spatial resolution of the FCC maps, and leveraging advancements in remote sensing technology to obtain more accurate and reliable results.

Application Of Near Real-Time And Multiscale Three Dimensional Earth Observation Platforms In Disaster Prevention,"Taiwan frequently experiences natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, landslides, debris flows, and earthquakes. Therefore, the instant acquisition of high-definition images and topographic or spatial data of affected areas as disasters occur is crucial for disaster response teams and making emergency aid decisions. The National Applied Research Laboratories has implemented the project ""development of near real-time, high-resolution, global earth observation 3D platform for applications to environmental monitoring and disaster mitigation."" This developmental project integrates earth observation technologies, data warehousing, high-performance visualization displays, grids, and disaster prevention technology to establish a near real-time high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) disaster prevention earth observation application platform for Taiwan. The main functions of this platform include (1) integration of observation information, such as Formosat-2 satellite remote sensing, aerial photography, and 3D photography of disaster sites, to provide multidimensional information of the conditions at the affected sites; (2) disaster prevention application technologies, such as large-sized high-resolution 3D projection system, medium-sized active stereo projection systems, and small-sized personal computers with multiscale 3D display systems; (3) a 3D geographical information network platform that integrates data warehousing and cloud services, complies with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) international standard for image data exchange and release processes, and includes image overlaying and added-value analysis of disasters; and (4) near real-time and automated simulation of image processing procedures, which accelerates orthophoto processing once raw data are received from satellites and provides appropriate images for disaster prevention decision-making within 3 to 6 h.

Benefits Of Earth Observation Data For Conservation Planning In The Case Of European Wetland Biodiversity,"To evaluate the status of biodiversity and to determine how current conservation efforts can be improved, biodiversity monitoring is crucial. An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-km(2) resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5' resolution. Costs of habitat protection and area requirements for reserves may be severely underestimated when conservation planning relies only on coarse-scale data, which may result in notable shortcomings in conservation target achievement. Improvements in conservation benefits far outweigh the additional costs of acquiring fine-scale data.",NA,NA,10.1017/s0376892912000331,{},included,NA
"Application Of Google Earth Engine Python Api And Naip Imagery For Land Use And Land Cover Classification: A Case Study In Florida, Usa","The analysis of land use and land cover data provides invaluable support to a variety of land management and conservation activities. However, historically its application has been limited by high costs associated with data acquisition, analysis, and classification. In recent years, freely available satellite imagery and geospatial data sets and rapid advancement in data analysis capabilities provide immense opportunities to understand and solve the real-world environmental problems. Open-source platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide a planetary-scale environmental science data and analyses capability at much greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional workflows. We evaluated the GEE Python API utility for classifying the freely available NAIP aerial imagery of 2017 to derive the land use land cover (LULC) information of a Panhandle area of Florida, USA.

Geospatial Web-Based Sensor Information Model For Integrating Satellite Observation: An Example In The Field Of Flood Disaster Management,"Flood observation-supporting satellite sensors (FO-SSs) are the important geospatial resources to flood disaster management.

Commercial Satellite Imagery In Peacekeeping Sensor CapabilitiesâPresent And Near Future,"The applications of commercial satellite imagery (CSI) have been wide-spread in non-peacekeeping domains such as mining, agriculture and forestry management, environment assessment, natural disaster damage assessment and urban planning for at least 25 years. With the successful launch of the IKONOS-2 high-resolution satellite borne sensor in September of 1999, the benefit of a high resolution sensor is now available from a commercial satellite platform. The UN has used commercial satellite imagery in several operations. The following technical information is provided to assist in identifying the CSI sensors that could best be used in a support role to UN operational peacekeeping and other assistance missions. These CSI sensors provide very large area coverage, nearly 32,000 sq km, at a reasonable spatial resolution (GSD) of 30 m. LANDSAT imagery collects data in the visible colour range of blue, green and red, three regions of the infrared range and one region of the thermal infrared. Â© 2004 James F.

Earth Observations Into Action: The Systemic Integration Of Earth Observation Applications Into National Risk Reduction Decision Structures,"Purpose: As stated in the United Nations Global Assessment Report 2022 Concept Note, decision-makers everywhere need data and statistics that are accurate, timely, sufficiently disaggregated, relevant, accessible and easy to use. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate scalable and replicable methods to advance and integrate the use of earth observation (EO), specifically ongoing efforts within the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Work Programme and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Work Plan, to support risk-informed decision-making, based on documented national and subnational needs and requirements. Design/methodology/approach: Promotion of open data sharing and geospatial technology solutions at national and subnational scales encourages the accelerated implementation of successful EO applications. These solutions may also be linked to specific Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) 2015â2030 Global Targets that provide trusted answers to risk-oriented decision frameworks, as well as critical synergies between the Sendai Framework and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This paper provides examples of these efforts in the form of platforms and knowledge hubs that leverage latest developments in analysis ready data and support evidence-based DRR measures. Findings: The climate crisis is forcing countries to face unprecedented frequency and severity of disasters. At the same time, there are growing demands to respond to policy at the national and international level. EOs offer insights and intelligence for evidence-based policy development and decision-making to support key aspects of the Sendai Framework. The GEO DRR Working Group and CEOS Working Group Disasters are ideally placed to help national government agencies, particularly national Sendai focal points to learn more about EOs and understand their role in supporting DRR. Originality/value: The unique perspective of EOs provide unrealized value to decision-makers addressing DRR. This paper highlights tangible methods and practices that leverage free and open source EO insights that can benefit all DRR practitioners.

Remote Sensing In Support For Monitoring Rice In The Senegal Catchment,"Senegal River catchment represents a vital source for its four riparian countries Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, which cooperate within the interstate agency OMVS (Senegal River Basin Development Authority). The key issue of integrated water resources management addressed major challenges, especially with climate change. Satellite imagery represents thus a relevant and inexpensive source of data for observing land use changes at large scale and thus provides management support. In this context, MOSIS project (Monitoring of Observations from Satellites for Innovative Services) arose based on a ""Living Lab"" approach between SOGED, CACG and E2L. Based on the needs of end-users, an operational tool was co-designed in a single year to localise and quantify rice producing areas using Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and Web resources. The purpose of the created WebGIS was to improve the recovery rate of the irrigation fee. Many added values have emerged when used in the field: improved identification of water users and land management, an access to water use history, performance of field agents and improved communication with users and other partners. As a first step, the Senegal River Delta alone was investigated where 80\% of irrigated surfaces are. Next steps are (1) the functional improvement of the WebGIS and the satellite image processing, (2) capacity building of SOGED, (3) regulatory certification of the tool and (4) extension of the study zone to the catchment area. The created Geo-Web service also aroused a great deal of interest among different partners and state structures. It enabled to bring out several ideas of other potential services that would rely on WEB resources and remote sensing in order to estimate spatialised, reliable and permanent management indicators on the Senegal catchment.",NA,NA,10.1051/lhb/2020049,{},included,NA
"Organisational Drivers For, Constraints On And Impacts Of Decision And Information Support Tool Use In Desertification Policy And Management","Arguments for the potential benefits that environmental decision and information support tools (DISTs) bring to managing complex environmental issues like desertification are well rehearsed. However our empirical understanding of the reasons why particular DISTs are or are not used by different policy and management organisations, and the impacts they have on the work of those organisations is substantially weaker. Such understanding is needed to determine whether concerns raised in the literature about poor adoption and use of DISTs are correct, to understand why, and to remedy them. This paper presents a thematic analysis of 31 exploratory interviews with representatives of 14 desertification policy and management organisations operating at different scales about their use of DISTs: specifically GIS. remote sensing, simulation models, statistical models and DSS. DISTs of all types were found to be used along with other sources of decision and information support including hard-copy maps, aerial photography, databases, academic literature and local participation. GIS was most widely used, by 9 of the organisations interviewed. From the interview data a generic conceptual model identifying the organisational drivers for, constraints on and impacts of DIST use in desertification policy and management organisations is developed and discussed. Drivers were grouped into those concerned with system attributes (e.g. ease of use, flexibility) and those concerned with how information is used organisationally (e.g. to facilitate communication, assessment of desertification). Barriers including DIST information attributes such as reliability and uncertainty, and additional financial investment arising from training, employment and infrastructure procurement were identified. Impacts were grouped into structural changes, individual work changes and financial investment needs. No systematic variation was evident in the drivers, constraints or impacts of use according to DIST type, although GIS was the most widely used DIST and consequently was associated with a larger number of each., Results are discussed in relation to existing theory and evidence on information system and DSS adoption and use, and found to be in agreement. The paper finishes with a set of recommended improvements to DIST design processes to enhance the uptake of and positive benefits associated with use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mapping Regional Land Cover With Modis Data For Biological Conservation: Examples From The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Usa And Para State, Brazil","The paper investigated the application of MODIS data for mapping regional land cover at moderate resolutions (250 and 500 in), for regional conservation purposes. Land cover maps were generated for two major conservation areas (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem-GYE, USA and the Par State, Brazil) using MODIS data and decision tree classifications. The MODIS land cover products were evaluated using existing Landsat TM land cover maps as reference data. The Landsat TM land cover maps were processed to their fractional composition at the MODIS resolution (250 and 500 m). In GYE, the MODIS land cover was very successful at mapping extensive cover types (e.g. coniferous forest and grasslands) and far less successful at mapping smaller habitats (e.g. wetlands, deciduous tree cover) that typically occur in patches that are smaller than the MODIS pixels, but are reported to be very important to biodiversity conservation. The MODIS classification for Para State was successful at producing a regional forest/non-forest product which is useful for monitoring the extreme human impacts such as deforestation. The ability of MODIS data to map secondary forest remains to be tested, since regrowth typically harbors reduced levels of biodiversity. The two case studies showed the value of using multi-date 250 m data with only two spectral bands, as well as single day 500 in data with seven spectral bands, thus illustrating the versatile use of MODIS data in two contrasting environments. MODIS data provide new options for regional land cover mapping that are less labor-intensive than Landsat and have higher resolution than previous 1 km AVHRR or the current 1 km global land cover product. The usefulness of the MODTS data in addressing biodiversity conservation questions will ultimately depend upon the patch sizes of important habitats and the land cover transformations that threaten them.

Keeping Up With Remote Sensing And Gi Advances- Policy And Legal Perspectives,"Technological advances in remote sensing capabilities, wider participation of commercial firms and the possibilities of 'processing' spatial data to create value-added information have given rise to a range of policy and legal issues in the geographic information (GI) field. How far satellite images can still be considered a 'public good', conflicts between commercial and national interests is becoming a major issue, especially where security is concerned, sovereignty and the rights of sensed states, shutter control vs transparency is debated, data access, IPR and infringement of privacy becoming more relevant are all discussed. At the same time, the societal and public good of GI is well accepted with innumerable national and international examples. It is clear that societies would greatly benefit from the proper use of GI. A multilateral debate to formulate a GI policy that will take account of these while ensuring that the full benefits of remote sensing are available to society is called for. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Forestry,"Remote sensing has numerous applications in forestry. Older, historical applications relied primarily on interpretation of aerial photography for forest inventories. More recently, newer airborne and spaceborne active and passive sensors have greatly expanded the utility of remote sensing in forestry. Examples include lidar, which can provide forest structural parameters such as tree height, crown volume, and stand biomass at accuracies that are equal to, or exceed, ground-based measures. Regional to global estimates of changes in forest cover have also been made possible by remote sensing, providing critical measures of changes in carbon stocks and fluxes needed to better understand human environmental impacts and better manage resources. Several operational remote sensing products contribute to improved assessment of fire danger, fire management, fire severity, and postfire recovery.

Application Of Remote Sensing Technology For Impact Assessment Of Watershed Development Programme,"The current study was taken up to investigate the utility of remote sensing and GIS tools for evaluation of Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP) implemented during 1997-2001 in Katangidda Nala watershed, Chincholi taluk, Gulbarga district, Karnataka. The study was carried out using IRS 1C, LISS III data of December 11, 1997 (pre-treatment) and November 15, 2002 (post-treatment) covering the watershed to assess the changes in land use / land cover and biomass that have changed over a period of five years (1997-2002). The images were classified into different land use/land cover categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach. The results indicated that the area under agriculture crops and forest land were increased by 671 ha (5.7%) and 1,414 ha (11.94%) respectively. This is due to the fact that parts of wastelands and fallow lands were brought into cultivation. This increase in the area may be attributed to better utilization of surface and ground waters, adoption of soil and water conservation practices and changes in cropping pattern. The area under waste lands and fallow lands decreased by 1,667 ha (14.07%) and 467 ha (3.94%), respectively. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (502 ha and 19 ha respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing and GIS was 2.2 times cheaper than the conventional methods. Thus, the repetitive coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the land resources and evaluate the land cover changes through comparison of images for the watershed at different periods.

May Smart Technologies Reduce The Environmental Impact Of Nitrogen Fertilization? A Case Study For Paddy Rice,"Precision agriculture is increasingly considered as a powerful solution to mitigate the environmental impact of farming systems. This is because of its ability to use multi-source information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management. Among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in research and operational contexts, variable rate (VR) nitrogen fertilization plays a key role. A promising approach to make quantitative, spatially distributed diagnoses to support VR N fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this study, a new smart app for field NNI estimates (PocketNNI) was developed, which can be integrated with remote sensing data. The environmental impact of using PocketNNI and Sentinel 2 products to drive fertilization was evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment approach and a case study on rice in northern Italy. In particular, the environmental performances of rice fertilized according to VR information derived from the integration of PocketNNI and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform N application. Primary data regarding the cultivation practices and the achieved yields were collected during field tests. Results showed that VR fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0\% to 13.6\% as compared to uniform N application. For Climate Change, the impact is reduced from 9373 to 832.7 kg CO2 eq/t of paddy rice. The highest environmental benefits - mainly due to an improved ratio between grain yield and N fertilizers were achieved in terms of energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of N compounds. Although further validation is needed, these preliminary results are promising and provide a first quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital technologies are used to support N fertilization.

A wide range of vicarious methodologies have been applied independently and then compared per type of target. All methods agree on the good radiometric performance of both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B with respect to the mission requirements as well as on evidence of a slight bias between the two instruments.

Wildfire Monitoring With Satellite Remote Sensing In Support Of Conservation,"This chapter finds its rationale in the key ecological role fire plays on ecosystems and biodiversity. In particular, it focuses on the use of satellite information to improve habitat monitoring in protected areas. Conservation practitioners need this information to meet their goals and improve management effectiveness. To address these needs, the European Commission worked in collaboration with conservation institutions and protected areas in Africa to build two systems for the distribution of satellite-based information to support conservation and decision making. The first system, the Fire Monitoring Tool, is a stand-alone web portal which provides near-real time information of fire activity based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The tool provides specific ecological indicators about fire in the world protected areas. Whereas the second system, the eStation, is a network of servers receiving EO-based products, including wildfire, used for protected area ecological assessment, but also national and regional environmental monitoring. The benefits provided by the systems are described in two case studies in Tanzania and Niger. The examples show how park ecologists have improved habitat monitoring and conservation efforts in the protected areas and how this can be repeated in other conservation areas.

Diversity Features Collaboration Technology For Monitoring Forest Before And After Hurricane By Remote Sensing,"Objective: Change monitoring and disaster assessment of hurricane-damaged forests is an important application of remote sensing technology. The extraction of feature information from remote sensing images is very important to the effect of forest remote sensing monitoring. The combination of diversity features can effectively improve the monitoring accuracy of forest change. However, the current spatial information acquisition algorithms, such as texture features, still retain the traditional fixed computing model and do not fully consider the diversity of the spatial distribution of ground objects. When extracting texture features, the accuracy of texture features will be affected if the sliding window is too large or too small. Therefore, the calculation method of this kind of texture feature is always faced with the problem of a hard balance between the number of features and the neighborhood reference range. Therefore, this paper focuses on forest change monitoring technology. Method: To solve the above problems, in this paper, a remote sensing monitoring method for forest destruction before and after hurricanes is proposed based on diversity feature collaborative technology. Firstly, the difference between normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (NDVI) before and after forest remote sensing image change was calculated. Secondly, the compound window technology is proposed to extract the texture features. Then, the texture features extracted from the remote sensing image and the spectrum of the remote sensing image were used to build a diversity characteristic combination model. This can enhance the diversity of features. Finally, an improved rotating forest algorithm based on feature separation is proposed to reduce the direct feature correlation and improve the accuracy of the classifier. Result: The study area used in this study is the remote sensing image of the Nezer forest in France before and after the hurricane, which is derived from the Formosat-2 satellite. In the experimental part, the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the other six methods. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional change detection methods based on spectral features and texture features, the overall accuracy of the proposed method, the detection accuracy of the changed area and the unchanged area are improved by 3.68%, 5.82% and 3.46%, respectively. In addition, this paper tested the sensitivity of features extracted by different methods to the number of training samples. The results show that the proposed method still maintains high classification accuracy in different training sample numbers, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are better than the comparison methods. And after the number of training samples reaches 50, the accuracy of the proposed method tends to flatten out. Conclusion: The proposed method can effectively improve the performance of forest change monitoring. This method can be used to monitor the change and damage of forests in real-time, and obtain the information of forest disaster areas efficiently, which can provide important reference data for the emergency decision-making of forest resource management departments. Therefore this method has high practical value. Â© 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,10.11834/jrs.20210230,"{""probs not""}",included,NA
Integrating Multisensor Satellite Data Merging And Image Reconstruction In Support Of Machine Learning For Better Water Quality Management,"Monitoring water quality changes in lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and coastal waters is critical in response to the needs for sustainable development. This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed ""cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning"" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

Reducing The Cost Of Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing: Combining Near-Infrared Video Imagery With Colour Aerial Photography,"Land managers are often confronted with management problems that could be addressed using decision support or management information systems. The use of such tools, however, depends on the availability of appropriately resolved spatial data. One source of such data is multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. The cost of such imagery, particularly where environmental goals are most important, is often prohibitive. Even when the cost of such imagery can be met; other factors, such as cloud cover for satellite-based systems or sensor scheduling for sophisticated airborne systems, may mean that imagery is not available. This paper investigates the utility of a system that combines near-infrared imagery from a video camera with conventional medium-format aerial photography deployed in a light aircraft platform. Previously, imagery obtained from video cameras has suffered from limited spectral range and from significant image motion effects. These problems were eliminated by the use of an electronic-shutter charge-coupled device video camera with a strong IR response. The systems components and the approach to their operational deployment are described and the options, for transforming the raw imagery into survey coverage discussed. The image quality and cost is presented for a site characterisation application where the aim is the generation of normalised difference vegetation index values. It is concluded that the system has significant potential-utility for decision support and land-management applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Agronomic Performance And Remote Sensing Assessment Of Organic And Mineral Fertilization In Rice Fields,"Introduction: Rice heavily relies on nitrogen fertilizers, posing environmental, resource, and geopolitical challenges. This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13\% and 15\% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.",NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2023.1230012,{},included,NA
Secure Spectrum Sharing For Satellite Internet-Of-Things Based On Blockchain,"Satellite Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a critical part to build information infrastructure for environmental and ecological monitoring in remote areas where the cellular networks are uneasy to cover. When massive IoT terminals pour in the crowded satellite channels, how to enhance the spectrum utility of satellite band and guarantee the system capacity calls for full investigations. In this paper, a secure spectrum optimization scheme is proposed in satellite IoT by introducing blockchain to hamper malicious users to involve in the spectrum sharing. A market-oriented spectrum optimization strategy is designed to improve the satellite systems' benefits wherein the heterogeneous satellite channels are fully be considered and priced. In this circumstance, differentiated pricing is adopted to satisfy the various spectrum users' demands. When applying blockchain to secure the spectrum trading, the edge computing along with the mechanism of user reputation are devised to address the concerns of limited computation power for general IoT devices. Besides, the consensus algorithm of Delegated Proof of Stake is used to improve the computing efficiency so as to better fit in the application circumstance of satellite IoT.

"Volume 9 Overview: Remote Sensing, Human Dimension And Societal Benefits","The expanding human dimension has severe implications for the environment and the societal benefits that accrue through wise use and strategic management of our natural resources, and the manner that people and social systems link to resource endowments, consume derived products, and create programs to benefit society. Remote sensing has a fundamental role to play in the characterization of our Earth through mapping, monitoring, and modeling, often requiring the fusion of multiresolution ground-based, airborne, and satellite assets to support comprehensive analyses. Affecting policies, programs, and legislation, remote sensing analyses of societal benefits associated with our key national priorities are vital to assessing status and threats to their sustainability. Often, land cover/land use change is used as a proxy to strategically assess changes in societal benefits and the implications of people, policies, and management programs on realizing full and effective benefits to society. The topics and approaches that are described in the following chapters, part of a broader initiative, the Comprehensive Remote Sensing project edited by Shunlin Liang, suggest a rich and varied perspective and a diversity of themes to fully assess the human dimension and the associated societal benefits. Through in situ data collection approaches, secondary data from social surveys and censuses, use of terrestrial LIDAR, unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne systems, and space-based technologies, a host of national and international study sites are examined to highlight fundamental questions, challenges, and opportunities in the use of comprehensive remote sensing to address people, environment, and their interactions to assess societal benefits and their space-time scales and variabilities.

European Space Agency's Strategic Contribution To Seismology,"The impacts of disaster events such as earthquakes on economic and human lives are increasing every year, in particular due to the growing urbanization. Until recently, stakeholders involved in disaster risk management focused their efforts mainly on the response phase, immediately after the crisis. Following the recommendations of several recent studies and in order to minimize the increasing impacts of natural disasters, decision-makers and major stakeholders have showed an increasing interest in mitigation activities. Earth Observation (EO) data from space could bring a significant added value to the various phases of the seismic risk management cycle from the mitigation and preparedness phases. Space agencies need to better contribute to the management of geohazards in response to the growing request from the community of users (e. g. seismologists, insurance companies, urban planners). To foster the use of EO remote sensing data, satellite data providers have to take the appropriate measures to remove the policy and technical barriers related to the data access. They have also to increase the awareness of the community of users on the potential benefits that could be gained from the use of EO satellite data. This paper will provide examples of areas where EO remote sensing data from space could bring an added value to the current management of risks and crisis related to earthquakes. Then, the paper will describe the strategic measures undertaken by the European Space Agency in an international framework, to foster the use of satellite data by the various relevant stakeholders.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11069-013-0579-0,{},included,NA
Complementing Satellites And Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Rangeland Assessment In Patagonia,"Rangelands assessment in arid and semiarid regions is a key tool both for livestock management planning and environmental diagnoses. Even though there is a consensus on the utility of such tools, rangeland assessment with high detail (grain) while covering large areas or landscapes (extension) is too costly. Then, the compatibility between the resolution and quality of information and the spatial extent required to make decisions in livestock systems is still an operational challenge that has not found an effective solution. Thus, the use of satellite images for rangeland assessments in different environments has been growing steadily in the last two decades. The developments associated with the capture of images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would offer many advantages as a complement to information, since they increase the spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to classify rangeland environments using satellite and UAV images and compare their respective contributions for rangeland assessments in Patagonia. In particular, spatial resolution of an unsupervised classification of rangeland environments using SPOT 7 satellite images and images captured by an optical sensor mounted on an UAV were compared. Rangeland assessment can be potentiated by the use of different sources of information in a more complementary and accessible way for environmental monitoring, and for a pastoral management planning in highly heterogeneous environments from arid and semiarid regions of Patagonia, Argentina.

Disaster Risk Reduction In Agriculture Through Geospatial (Big) Data Processing,"Intensive farming on land represents an increased burden on the environment due to, among other reasons, the usage of agrochemicals. Precision farming can reduce the environmental burden by employing site specific crop management practices which implement advanced geospatial technologies for respecting soil heterogeneity. The objectives of this paper are to present the frontier approaches of geospatial (Big) data processing based on satellite and sensor data which both aim at the prevention and mitigation phases of disaster risk reduction in agriculture. Three techniques are presented in order to demonstrate the possibilities of geospatial (Big) data collection in agriculture: (1) farm machinery telemetry for providing data about machinery operations on fields through the developed MapLogAgri application; (2) agrometeorological observation in the form of a wireless sensor network together with the SensLog solution for storing, analysing, and publishing sensor data; and (3) remote sensing for monitoring field spatial variability and crop status by means of freely-available high resolution satellite imagery. The benefits of re-using the techniques in disaster risk reduction processes are discussed. The conducted tests demonstrated the transferability of agricultural techniques to crisis/emergency management domains.",NA,NA,10.3390/ijgi6080238,{},included,NA
Metrics To Accelerate Private Sector Investment In Sustainable Development Goal 2-Zero Hunger,"Substantial investment from both the private and public sectors will be needed to achieve the ambitious Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2), which focuses on ending poverty and achieving zero hunger. To harness the private sector, high quality, transparent metrics are needed to ensure that every dollar spent reaches the most marginalized segments of a community while still helping institutions achieve their goals. Satellite-derived Earth observations will be instrumental in accelerating these investments and targeting them to the regions with the greatest need. This article proposes two quantitative metrics that could be used to evaluate the impact of private sector activities on SDG2: measuring increases in yield over baseline and ensuring input availability and affordability in all markets.",NA,NA,10.3390/su13115967,{},included,NA
Application-Oriented Real-Time Remote Sensing Service Technology,"The aerospace industry in China has developed rapidly over the past 40 years. Remote sensing satellites have grown and gradually developed, and this situation has formed a variety of various satellite series. The communication satellite series, navigation satellite series, Earth observation satellite series, and science and technology test satellite series constitute the current application satellite system in China, which is used in national land and resources survey, meteorological services, environmental monitoring, ocean remote sensing, and other fields. This system provides the foundation for the development of satellite applications. At present, the satellite systems of communication, navigation, and remote sensing are separate and independent. Thus, they cannot meet the real-time, intelligent, and diversified requirements in the era of big data. In addition to the application of land, surveying and mapping, planning, geology and mining, agriculture, transportation, marine, and other industries, the government, enterprises, and the public have shown a large and urgent need for satellite remote sensing navigation data and services, especially high-resolution satellite remote sensing data and services. The demand of users in different industries and fields for remote sensing data products has gradually changed from singularity and standardization to diversification and specialization; from static investigation to dynamic monitoring, forecasting, and forecasting; from qualitative analysis to quantitative research; and from general application to batch business. Therefore, with the application requirements as the traction, focusing on improving the service capabilities of satellite remote sensing, the communication-navigation-remote sensing integrated space-based information service system with integrated communication, navigation, and remote sensing can be built to provide all-day, all-weather, all-region application-oriented services. This system fully utilizes the benefits of satellite applications. Thus, it breaks the barriers of satellites of communication, navigation, and remote sensing. Building a space-based information real-time service system (positioning, navigation, timing, remote sensing, communication, PNTRC) based on ""one-satellite multitasking, multi-satellite networking, multi-network integration, and intelligent services"" that integrates communication, navigation, and remote sensing, has become an important direction for the development of contemporary aerospace information technology. In the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, it is inevitable to study remote sensing service technologies for real-time applications in the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence is important to meet people's strong demand for ""fast, accurate, and flexible"" remote sensing information services with the way of B2B, B2G, or B2C. This paper first studied the real-time service capabilities of space-air-ground-sea integrated Earth observation network. Then, the real-time application service requirements of remote sensing technology (requirements for high-efficiency remote sensing services for earthquake and disaster relief, remote sensing monitoring requirements for land surface deformation, and demand for public real-world services) were elaborated. Finally, the on-orbit processing technology based on artificial intelligence was analyzed, and the trend of remote sensing technology transformed from remote sensing information to real-time services was discussed.

The Emerging Role Of Remote Sensing Technology In Emergency Management,"The use of remote sensing technology is becoming increasingly widespread at all levels of the disaster management cycle. This paper reviews a number of emerging application areas, drawing on examples from both natural disasters such as earthquakes, and man-made events including recent terrorist attacks. In terms of mitigation and preparedness, remote sensing is making an increasing contribution towards inventory development, hazard and risk assessment and logistical planning. After a disaster has occurred, remote sensing offers a rapid low-risk method of assessing damage to critical infrastructure and the urban built environment. In particular, high resolution coverage enabled the detection of bridge damage following the Northridge earthquake and collapsed buildings following various earthquakes in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Once the initial chaos has subsided, the value of remote sensing data lies in post-event monitoring; tracking changes in hazard location and extent. Reference is made to emergency operations following the World Trade Center attack, where remote sensing imagery supported various response efforts. In terms of secondary applications, details are given concerning innovative new research, using information derived from remote sensing coverage for running traffic rerouting programs, and as a supplementary data source for loss estimation models.

Value Of Airborne Laser Scanning And Digital Aerial Photogrammetry Data In Forest Decision Making,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been the main method for acquiring data for forest management planning in Finland and Norway in the last decade. Recently, digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has provided an interesting alternative, as the accuracy of stand-based estimates has been quite close to that of ALS while the costs are markedly smaller. Thus, it is important to know if the better accuracy of ALS is worth the higher costs for forest owners. In many recent studies, the value of forest inventory information in the harvest scheduling has been examined, for instance through cost-plus-loss analysis. Cost-plus-loss means that the quality of the data is accounted for in monetary terms through calculating the losses due to errors in the data in the forest management planning context. These costs are added to the inventory costs. In the current study, we compared the losses of ALS and DAP at plot level. According to the results, the data produced using DAP are as good as data produced using ALS from a decision making point of view, even though ALS is slightly more accurate. ALS is better than DAP only if the data will be used for more than 15 years before acquiring new data, and even then the difference is quite small. Thus, the increased errors in DAP do not significantly affect the results from a decision making point of view, and ALS and DAP data can be equally well recommended to the forest owners for management planning. The decision of which data to acquire, can thus be made based on the availability of the data on first hand and the costs of acquiring it on the second hand.",NA,NA,10.14214/sf.9923,{},included,NA
Increasing The Use Of Earth Science Data And Models In Air Quality Management,"In 2010, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) initiated the Air Quality Applied Science Team (AQAST) as a 5-year, \$ 17.5-million award with 19 principal investigators. AQAST aims to increase the use of Earth science products in air quality-related research and to help meet air quality managers' information needs. We conducted a Web-based survey and a limited number of follow-up interviews to investigate federal, state, tribal, and local air quality managers' perspectives on usefulness of Earth science data and models, and on the impact AQAST has had. The air quality managers we surveyed identified meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter, emissions from mobile sources, and interstate air pollution transport as top challenges in need of improved information. Most survey respondents viewed inadequate coverage or frequency of satellite observations, data uncertainty, and lack of staff time or resources as barriers to increased use of satellite data by their organizations. Managers who have been involved with AQAST indicated that the program has helped build awareness of NASA Earth science products, and assisted their organizations with retrieval and interpretation of satellite data and with application of global chemistry and climate models. AQAST has also helped build a network between researchers and air quality managers with potential for further collaborations. Implications: NASA's Air Quality Applied Science Team (AQAST) aims to increase the use of satellite data and global chemistry and climate models for air quality management purposes, by supporting research and tool development projects of interest to both groups. Our survey and interviews of air quality managers indicate they found value in many AQAST projects and particularly appreciated the connections to the research community that the program facilitated. Managers expressed interest in receiving continued support for their organizations' use of satellite data, including assistance in retrieving and interpreting data from future geostationary platforms meant to provide more frequent coverage for air quality and other applications.",NA,NA,10.1080/10962247.2016.1248303,{},included,NA
Agricultural Case Studies For Measuring The Value Of Information Of Earth Observation And Other Geospatial Information For Decisions,"In this chapter, two case studies that involve the quantitative estimation of the value of information (VOI) in specific adaptation and mitigation decisions in the agriculture sector are summarized. The first case study focuses on adapting land use to sustain drinking water quality and to avoid an increase in the contamination of groundwater by agrochemicals. In the first example the Landsat archive is used to evaluate the societal benefits to adapt agricultural land management to reduce nonpoint source groundwater contamination. The second case study targets mitigating drought disasters by determining farmer eligibility for financial assistance by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For the second example the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide data to assess the economic loss due to the misspecification of eligibility for drought disaster assistance and insurance that is evaluated in a specific drought policy. In each case, Earth observation data are transformed into information and is processed with other science-based indicators, as well as socioeconomic data in support of applicable communities.

Planning Iterative Investment For Landscape Restoration: Choice Of Biodiversity Indicator Makes A Difference,"Natural regrowth vegetation offers a cost-effective means of restoring some degraded landscapes. Worldwide, policy responses to climate change are increasing the attractiveness of investment in regrowth protection or facilitation which with strategic planning could also deliver substantial dividends for biodiversity conservation. This study compares the performance of two commonly used indicators of biodiversity conservation priority, irreplaceability and complementarity, as tools to support planning for iterative investment to protect natural regrowth of Brigalow, an endangered ecological community in subtropical eastern Australia. Brigalow covered more than seven million hectares prior to clearing, it now persists 'intact' on less than a tenth of that area but there are significant areas of regrowth. Data on Brigalow regrowth derived from mapping and remote sensing identify 10,555 patches covering 280,000 hectares in total. Two different classifications are used to represent Brigalow biodiversity: a land-type classification of 16 'regional ecosystems' mapped at 1:100,000 scale, and a landscape-scale classification of 40 biogeographic subregions that discriminate relatively uniform landscapes at about 1:500,000 scale. Conservation targets are expressed as the extent of regrowth needed to increase the extent of intact or 'remnant' areas of each biodiversity feature to either 5\% or 10\% of its former extent. In each case, irreplaceability and complementarity are positively correlated, and either metric type could be used to identify relatively large sets of high-priority patches. However, regional-scale restoration is likely to involve iterative investment and therefore to require discrimination of relatively small sets of patches of the highest priority for biodiversity conservation. Irreplaceability is not an ideal measure of biodiversity value when planning such iterative processes, simply because irreplaceability is uninformative for ranking 'high-value' patches; they all have the highest possible score. This study demonstrates the importance of considering quite fundamental points when choosing metrics for conservation planning, such as the frequency distribution of values they produce. Where planning aims to identify quite small sets of very high value features metrics that are most variable among the highest value patches, like the one used for complementarity, in this study, will be more useful than metrics that are strongly bounded at higher values.

Measuring The Economic Benefits Of An Environmental Monitoring Satellite Project: The Value Of Information Approach,"This paper reports a first application of contingent valuation method to measure the value of information generated by earth science data from an environmental geostationary satellite payload called Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Satellite. The purpose of the space project is to improve the accuracy of air pollution information by enhancing air pollution monitoring and forecasting system coupled with conventional ground level monitoring stations located throughout South Korea. Estimation results based on a survey data of 1000 households show that most explanatory variables including bid amounts and household income significantly influenced dichotomous choice contingent valuation responses with expected signs. When applied to the whole sample, mean willingness to pay reflecting both use and non-use values was stable at around \$3.70 per year for the improvement of air quality information. Present values of total benefits over the lifetime period of the space satellite exceed the cost born by tax payers with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.77. The result of this study clearly suggests that contingent valuation method can be used as an alternative approach in measuring the value of information from a space-derived earth science project.

"How Remote Sensing Supports Mangrove Ecosystem Service Valuation: A Case Study In Ca Mau Province, Vietnam","This paper highlights the importance of using household survey and remote sensing data for the assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (fisheries and timber related products, carbon sequestration, storm protection) in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam. The results indicate that remote sensing plays an important role in ecosystem service valuation in the large areas where mangroves and aquaculture are mixed. We estimated the value of mangrove ecosystem services using market price and replacement cost approaches to determine an initial assessment of the overall contribution of mangroves to human well-being. The total estimated value was US\$ 600 million/year for 187,533 ha (approximately US\$ 3000/ ha/year), which is slightly smaller than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the province (US\$ 0.69 billion in 2010). However, this is only a partial estimate that does not consider other services (tourism, biocliversity, cultural and social values), clue to the absence of primary data The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to combine the approaches of remote sensing and household survey for the quantification of mangrove ecosystem services in the mangrove-shrimp integrated system. Our findings indicate that the continued expansion of acivaculture has reduced the benefits to local communities provided by the mangrove ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Six Dimensions Of Value Associated To The Use Of Copernicus Sentinel Data: Key Findings From The Sentinel Benefits Study,"The role of Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites in supporting informed decision-making and more efficient operational processes is becoming increasingly recognized. However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis. The six dimensions are described in the paper and have been tested on a significant number of recent cases. The paper describes the updated methodology and the results obtained through its application.",NA,NA,10.3389/fenvs.2022.804862,{},included,NA
Numerical Modelling And Satellite Remote Sensing As Tools For Research And Management Of Marine Fishery Resources,"This chapter outlines the use of modelled and satellite remote sensing (SRS) data in supporting the research, technology-development and management of marine fishery resources. The value of such methods used in marine fisheries management is emphasized. State of art techniques in fisheries resource management utilizing numerical models, and SRS, separately and jointly, are described here. Numerical models are useful for studying fish and other aquatic invertebrate larval transport. SRS data are used to locate fish stocks, locate areas of reef stress and delineate areas of high productivity in the wake of cyclone paths. Coupling SRS with models helps to manage fishery resources on an ecosystem scale, generate potential fishing zones (PFZ), forecast ocean state (OSF), detect meso-scale features such as eddies and track cyclones threatening coastal resources. Modelled, SRS and in situ data sets in combination can be used in the estimation of potential fishery resources in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which in turn can help in fishing fleet management. Hence, there is a huge scope for application of numerical modelling and SRS in marine fisheries research and management.

"Coordinated Capacity Development To Maximize The Contributions Of Space Science, Technology, And Its Applications In Support Of Implementing Global Sustainable Development Agendas-A Conceptual Framework","Space science, technology, and its applications have the potential to make essential contributions to the implementation of global development agendas which encompass the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Member States of the United Nations are ultimately responsible for implementing the development agendas at the national level. The use of Earth observation tools can provide timely and reliable input data to the Global Indicator Framework to directly follow-up and review some of the sustainable development goals 169 targets. The continued user of these tools gives Member States the capability to evaluate the effectiveness of actions taken to reach specific targets and to report on progress achieved or shortcomings that need to be addressed. For many countries, capacity development is an essential factor for making optimal use of solutions offered by space activities. A large number of stakeholders, including international, regional, and national entities, are providing relevant capacity development activities. This article provides a pragmatic conceptual framework for improved collaboration and coordination of capacity development to assist Member States to fully utilize the contributions of space science, technology, and its applications to implement the global development agendas and to benefit society. The proposed coordination of capacity development needs to be integrated into an overall results-based management approach for optimizing the use of space science, technology, and its applications in support of global development agendas.

Economic Feasibility Study For Pavement Monitoring Using Synthetic Aperture Radar-Based Satellite Remote Sensing Cost-Benefit Analysis,Recent developments in satellite remote sensing and the availability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) products have created an opportunity for the use of SAR-based monitoring for pavement and infrastructure management. No previous studies have performed a detailed cost-benefit analysis to analyze the economic feasibility of pavement monitoring through the use of SAR-based satellite remote sensing. The aim of this study was to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a comprehensive methodology to estimate the most important benefits and expenses associated with the use of data obtained from satellites by SAR and interferometric SAR for advanced monitoring of the infrastructure and to gain a better understanding of the strategies used to identify their effects. A general cost-benefit analysis framework that could serve as a pavement management tool for assessment of pavement deformations and deformation velocities with millimeter accuracy was developed. The results of a case study performed in the state of Delaware to demonstrate how the proposed approaches can be used to assess the impacts of SAR-based monitoring projects are also presented.,NA,NA,10.3141/2645-01,{},included,NA
Review Of Fews Net Biophysical Monitoring Requirements,"The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) provides monitoring and early warning support to decision makers responsible for responding to famine and food insecurity. FEWS NET transforms satellite remote sensing data into rainfall and vegetation information that can be used by these decision makers. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently funded activities to enhance remote sensing inputs to FEWS NET. To elicit Earth observation requirements, a professional review questionnaire was disseminated to FEWS NET expert end-users; it focused upon operational requirements to determine additional useful remote sensing data and, subsequently, to assess whether such data would be beneficial as FEWS NET biophysical supplementary inputs. The review was completed by over 40 experts from around the world. Reviewers were asked to evaluate the relative importance of environmental variables and spatio-temporal requirements for Earth science data products, in particular for rainfall and vegetation products. The results showed that spatio-temporal resolution requirements are complex and need to vary according to place, time, and hazard; that high resolution remote sensing products continue to be in demand; and that rainfall and vegetation products are valued as data that provide actionable food security information.",NA,NA,10.1088/1748-9326/4/2/024009,{},included,NA
Remote Sensing For Restoration Planning: How The Big Picture Can Inform Stakeholders,"The use of remote sensing in ecosystem management has transformed how land managers, practitioners, and policymakers evaluate ecosystem loss, gain, and change at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Less developed is the use of these spatial tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating ecosystem restoration projects and especially so in multifunctional landscapes. We use a case study approach in a multistakeholder tropical dryland restoration project to highlight the potential of remotely sensed products to quantitatively and economically guide often conflicting restoration priorities with stakeholder objectives. High-resolution digital elevation models derived from an airborne remote sensing platform informed land managers tasked with endangered species restoration by guiding their efforts to highly suitable areas of the landscape where plant growth, performance, and survival should be greater. In turn, satellite-based monitoring offered a temporal approach to broadly quantify vegetation fire risk in order to restrict fire promoting activities in dry landscapes most modified by fire promoting invasive grasses. Together, the delineation of high suitability areas for plant-based restoration and low suitability areas for wildfire management ultimately releases moderate suitability land for alternative land uses deemed important in multistakeholder landscapes. We review the benefits of using remotely sensed data for restoration planning, and highlight the costs and benefits of various data sources.",NA,NA,10.1111/rec.12448,{},included,NA
"Policy Implications Of Remote Sensing In Understanding Urban Environments: Developing A Wetlands Inventory For Community Decision-Making In Lucas County, Ohio","The growth in urbanized land has created a variety of impacts to natural areas. Urbanization has many effects on a wetland in terms of climate, air and water quality, hydrological changes, and boundaries and fragmentation of flora and fauna (Ehrenfeld, 2000). Wetlands must be valued as they provide many public amenities with long-term functions, which may be unrecoverable if the wetlands are lost through development, including drainage, water supply and natural habitat provisions (Mitsch et al, 2000). Because public policy supported the filling and destruction of wetlands for so long, land use planners are often reluctant or uninformed on how to integrate them into urban environments (Tilton, 1995). The use of remote sensing technology for the identification, inventory, mapping, and classification of land wetlands has been a common application of satellite imagery (MacDonald, 1999; Lyon, 2001). Numerous studies have discussed the positive benefits and opportunities presented by the technology as well as the barriers and limitations (Hardisky et al, 1986; Johnston and Barson, 1993; Kindscher et al., 1998; Lunetta and Barlogh, 1999; Munyati, 1999; Schmidt and Skidmore, 2003, Shuman and Ambrose, 2003, Townsend and Walsh, 2001). With recent improvements in the methods, computing advances, and the easier access and availability of the satellite imagery and data, it has become more possible to consider further advancements in the use of remote sensing to specifically address issues associated with wetlands research and related policy implications. The results of such research have important applications in addressing wetland management issues-such as wetland loss, degradation, and potential for restoration and remediation-within urban centers where land use pressures have negative impacts on the existence and health of wetland ecosystems. For a comprehensive review of the issues regarding the use of satellite remote sensing for wetlands, the reader is referred to Ozesmi and Bauer (2002). Beyond the methodological and technological advances-and remaining limitations-related to the use of remote sensing for wetlands inventories there are several other practical related issues in regards to how the results from such studies can be applied to address the management and decision-making at the community scale in urban areas. In addition to overcoming common barriers characteristic to the transfer of advanced computer technology-such as needs for software training, access to data sets, the availability of sufficient computer hardware requirements, and related cost issues-the use of remote sensing requires consideration of several other additional remaining issues. The application and transfer of remote sensing methods and technology for urban planning requires understanding of the complexity of wetland definitions and related management issues, acceptance of the level of accuracy obtained by the remote sensing technology, commitment for the support and funding necessary to continue and maintain inventories, databases, and for future updating of the wetland classification. The technical, educational, and decision-making issues regarding the development and utilization of remote sensing for a wetlands inventory for use in urban planning and decision-making will be examined in this paper.

Cooperation In Earth Observation Missions In Africa: A Role For Afrigeoss,"This paper is aimed at examining the role of African Global Earth Observation System of Systems (AfriGEOSS) in Earth Observation (EO) mission cooperation on the continent of Africa. It discusses the importance of earth observation programs for developing countries as well as the benefits of international cooperative efforts. The paper further examined some collaborative projects on Earth Observation in Africa and their associated problems. It specifically looked at the EO data coordination initiatives such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), GEOSS, Africa Discovery Broker, etc. It then situates AfriGEOSS in the context of African Space Agenda (ASA) with recommendations especially to the Africa Union Commission for the realization of ASA set goals.

Design And Simulation In Sar Satellites' Task Planning System Using Genetic Algorithm With Entropy Operator,"Purpose - This paper aims to innovatively propose to improve the efficiency of satellite observation and avoid the waste of satellite resources, a genetic algorithm with entropy operator (GAE) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites' task planning algorithm. Design/methodology/approach - The GAE abbreviated as GAE introduces the entropy value of each orbit task into the fitness calculation of the genetic algorithm, which makes the orbit with higher entropy value more likely to be selected and participate in the remaining process of the genetic algorithm. Findings - The simulation result shows that in a condition of the same calculate ability, 85\% of the orbital revisit time is unchanged or decreased and 30\% is significantly reduced by using the GAE compared with traditional task planning genetic algorithm, which indicates that the GAE can improve the efficiency of satellites' task planning. Originality/value - The GAE is an optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. It combines entropy in thermodynamics with task planning problems. The algorithm considers the whole lifecycle of task planning and gets the desired results. It can greatly improve the efficiency of task planning in observation satellites and shorten the entire task execution time. Then, using the GAE to complete SAR satellites' task planning is of great significance in reducing satellite operating costs and emergency rescue, which brings certain economic and social benefits.",NA,NA,10.1108/aeat-11-2020-0247,{},included,NA

Measuring And Monitoring Restored Ecosystems: Can Remote Sensing Be Applied To The Ecological Recovery Wheel To Inform Restoration Success?,"The commencement of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration has highlighted the urgent need to improve restoration science and fast-track ecological outcomes. The application of remote sensing for monitoring purposes has increased over the past two decades providing a variety of image datasets and derived products suitable to map and measure ecosystem properties (e.g. vegetation species, community composition, and structural dimensions such as height and cover). However, the operational use of remote sensing data and derived products for ecosystem restoration monitoring in research, industry, and government has been relatively limited and underutilized. In this paper, we use the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) ecological recovery wheel (ERW) to assess the current capacity of drone-airborne-satellite remote sensing datasets to measure each of the SER's recommended attributes and sub-attributes for terrestrial restoration projects. Based on our combined expertise in the areas of ecological monitoring and remote sensing, a total of 11 out of 18 sub-attributes received the highest feasibility score and show strong potential for remote sensing assessments; while sub-attributes such as gene flows, all trophic levels and chemical and physical substrates have a reduced capacity for monitoring. We argue that in the coming decade, ecologists can combine remote sensing with the ERW to monitor restoration recovery and reference ecosystems for improved restoration outcomes at the local, regional, and landscape scales. The ERW approach can be adapted as a monitoring framework for projects to utilize the benefits of remote sensing and inform management through scalable, operational, and meaningful outcomes.",NA,NA,10.1111/rec.13724,{},included,NA
Valuing The Potential Impacts Of Geoss: A Systems Dynamics Approach,"Global earth observations are perceived as instrumental to attaining sustainable development goals. Methods to assess the long-run socioeconomic benefits of the emerging global Earth observation system of systems (GEOSS) as an integrated multisensor infrastructure have been missing to date. This chapter presents a systems dynamics approach to assess the effect of improvements in Earth observations across the nine societal benefit areas of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). Two types of integration are assessed with the proposed model structure: (1) measuring benefits in an integrated assessment environment (e.g., improved weather forecasting through better measurement of cloud properties could lead to benefits in the agriculture, energy and water sectors); and (2) measuring benefits of an integrated observing system (e.g., in areas with high cloud cover, improvements in the resolution of optical sensors will lead to benefits only if linked to supplementary observing systems such a radar or ground surveys). The benefits from integration relate mostly to economies of scope on both the observation and benefit system sides. Cost reduction from economies of scale are derived from a global or large scale observing system vis-a-vis the currently prevailing patchwork system of national or regional observing systems. Results indicate that the total system benefits of GEOSS are usually orders of magnitude higher than their costs. Benefits are also policy dependent and tend to increase with the degree of implementation of mainly international environmental agreements.

The Efficacy Of Tm Satellite Imagery For Rapid Assessment Of Chihuahuan Xeric Habitat Intactness For Ecoregion-Scale Conservation Planning,"A critical step in designing effective conservation landscapes is the identification of relatively intact natural habitats. Satellite remote sensing has been effectively used to distinguish relatively intact and degraded forests at a number of scales. However, the utility of remote sensing data for rapid and cost-effective assessments of habitat intactness across large and regions has not been adequately tested. To this end, we tested the ability of TM imagery to rapidly discriminate different levels of habitat degradation across large regions of the Chihuahuan Desert. We were able to identify relatively intact habitat in many cases. However, degraded habitat was often misidentified as relatively intact. The use of both mid- and late-season imagery provides some improvement by highlighting phenological differences among the intactness classes. Overall, low vegetation cover and inter- and intra-seasonal variability diminish the utility of TM imagery for large-scale conservation planning in the Chihuahuan Desert.

Using Landsat Satellite Data To Support Pesticide Exposure Assessment In California,"Background: The recent U. S. Geological Survey policy offering Landsat satellite data at no cost provides researchers new opportunities to explore relationships between environment and health. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential for using Landsat satellite data to support pesticide exposure assessment in California. Methods and Results: We collected a dense time series of 24 Landsat 5 and 7 images spanning the year 2000 for an agricultural region in Fresno County. We intersected the Landsat time series with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) land use map and selected field samples to define the phenological characteristics of 17 major crop types or crop groups. We found the frequent overpass of Landsat enabled detection of crop field conditions (e. g., bare soil, vegetated) over most of the year. However, images were limited during the winter months due to cloud cover. Many samples designated as single-cropped in the CDWR map had phenological patterns that represented multi-cropped or non-cropped fields, indicating they may have been misclassified. Conclusions: We found the combination of Landsat 5 and 7 image data would clearly benefit pesticide exposure assessment in this region by 1) providing information on crop field conditions at or near the time when pesticides are applied, and 2) providing information for validating the CDWR map. The Landsat image time-series was useful for identifying idle, single-, and multi-cropped fields. Landsat data will be limited during the winter months due to cloud cover, and for years prior to the Landsat 7 launch (1999) when only one satellite was operational at any given time. We suggest additional research to determine the feasibility of integrating CDWR land use maps and Landsat data to derive crop maps in locations and time periods where maps are not available, which will allow for substantial improvements to chemical exposure estimation.",NA,NA,10.1186/1476-072x-9-46,{},included,NA
Translating Marine Animal Tracking Data Into Conservation Policy And Management,"There have been efforts around the globe to track individuals of many marine species and assess their movements and distribution, with the putative goal of supporting their conservation and management. Determining whether, and how, tracking data have been successfully applied to address real-world conservation issues is, however, difficult. Here, we compile a broad range of case studies from diverse marine taxa to show how tracking data have helped inform conservation policy and management, including reductions in fisheries bycatch and vessel strikes, and the design and administration of marine protected areas and important habitats. Using these examples, we highlight pathways through which the past and future investment in collecting animal tracking data might be better used to achieve tangible conservation benefits.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.tree.2019.01.009,{},included,NA
The Economic Impact Analysis Of Satellite Development And Its Application In Korea,"Many countries began satellite development from the beginning of the space era and especially after the Apollo era. Korea started satellite development in 1992 by launching small satellite KITSAT-1 more than 20 years after the Apollo 11 lunar landing. Since then, Korea has developed 15 satellites including eight small satellites, five low earth orbit (LEO) Korean Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSAT), and two geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites. Korea is currently developing KOMPSAT 6 and 7 with advanced optical and radar observation capability, GEO-KOMPSAT 2B, middle-sized Compact Advanced Satellites (CAS), and next generation small satellite (NEXTSat). These efforts will raise Korea's satellite technology to the next level. To prepare strategies for efficient and effective development of satellites, it is essential to elaborately assess the economic impacts of previous satellite development projects and their application. In this paper, we examine the economic impacts of Korea's investment into the research and development of national satellites, and their application in the perspective of satellite value chain. To this end, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis on the development of representative satellites. As non-economic impacts, we examined the change of technology independence and technology level, network building effect, and aerospace ecosystem activation effects.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.06.031,{},included,NA
Using Very High Resolution Remote Sensing For The Management Of Coral Reef Fisheries: Review And Perspectives,"Coral reef fisheries are critical for food security and as a source of income in developing and developed countries, but they are collapsing in many areas. Following the emergence and routine availability of commercial very high spatial resolution (0.6-10 m) multispectral satellite images, we reviewed the use of these new high-quality remote sensing data and products for coral reef fisheries management. The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements.

The Social Value Of Earth Observation: A New Evaluation Framework For Public High-Tech Infrastructures,"This paper addresses the main challenges of evaluating the socio-economic impact of high-tech infrastructures, using Earth observation (EO) as an example. EO is a critical domain of the space economy, providing valuable insights into planet Earth's natural and societal aspects. As national agencies invest in high-tech infrastructures like EO, there is a growing need for evaluate their socio-economic returns (not to be confused with their financial returns). However, there is no clear consensus on how to assess such social impact. Building on a new field of studies of social cost-benefit analysis of research infrastructures and the socioeconomic impact of investment in the space economy, we propose a new evaluation framework that considers the various stakeholders along the EO value chain. This approach can be adapted to evaluate the socio-economic returns of other high-tech public infrastructures, such as telescopes, particle accelerators, genomic platforms, synchrotron light sources, supercomputers and cloud infrastructures.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.strueco.2023.09.003,{},included,NA
Integrating Remote Sensing In Natura 2000 Habitat Monitoring: Prospects On The Way Forward,"Monitoring and reporting on the state of nature gained increasing importance in the European Union with the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. Reporting habitat conservation status requires detailed knowledge on many aspects of habitats at different spatial levels. Remote sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for Natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited. One reason for this appears to be the knowledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community. We conducted a review of legal monitoring and reporting requirements on Natura 2000 habitats, looked into the current use of remote sensing in habitat reporting, and consulted monitoring experts in nature conservation administrations to find out about their attitude and expectations towards remote sensing. In this paper, we disclose and summarise the real data needs behind the legal requirements for Natura 2000 habitat monitoring and reporting, analyse opportunities and constraints for remote sensing, and highlight bottlenecks and pathways to resolve them. Monitoring experts are not unwilling to use remote sensing data, but they are unsure of whether remote sensing can suit their needs in a cost-effective way. They look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation. Based on our findings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into Natura 2000 habitat monitoring could benefit from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved.

"Smart Solutions For Municipal Flood Management: Overview Of Literature, Trends, And Applications In German Cities","The paper outlines the challenges municipalities face when it comes to dealing with flood disasters and identifies general concepts for smart solutions that address the challenges and help cities to improve their flood resilience. It follows a unique and novel transdisciplinary approach in that it condenses the scientific literature to the most salient concepts in the fields of big data, digital twins, and remote sensing and support. As for big data applications, their main improvement to conventional flood management stems from the integration of different data streams to improve situational awareness. Digital twins not only help to improve the speed and quality of management decisions by visualizing complex data in a simple and accessible way during a disaster; they can also simulate the evolution of a disaster while taking into account the unique characteristics and conditions of a city, thereby acting as a critical element of an early warning system. Remote sensing and support with UAV solve the problem of physical and informational access to a disaster zone. In conclusion, the paper shows that smart solutions can be of great benefit for flood management, and that cities should strive to enhance existing infrastructure and processes with digital technologies.",NA,NA,10.3390/smartcities6020046,{},included,NA
Layering Natural Resource And Human Resource Data For Planning Watershed Conservation Strategies,"This article provides a case study of how natural resource inventory information from preexisting geographic information system (GIS) data layers and an analysis of IKONOS satellite imagery can be combined with data from a survey of landowners to create a unique strategic planning process for watershed protection. The ability to identify important environmental features such as unfragmented forest, stream systems, and forested wetlands is an important part of watershed conservation projects, as is the ability to identify landowners cost/benefit perceptions and intentions concerning conservation practices such as forest stewardship. Together these two functions permit land protection techniques and landowner outreach strategies to be targeted where they will be most efficient and effective.

Land Cover Classification In Mangrove Ecosystems Based On Vhr Satellite Data And Machine Learning-An Upscaling Approach,"Mangrove forests grow in the inter-tidal areas along coastlines, rivers, and tidal lands. They are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans. In order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems. Since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous. In this study, we investigated the potential of combining Sentinel-2 and Worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in Iran with an area of 768 km(2). The upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from Worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on Sentinel-2 images. We used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems. The approach resulted in a 65.5\% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover. Mapping accuracies improved with this approach, resulting in medium overall accuracy even though the user's accuracy of some classes, such as tidal zone and shallow water, was low. Conservation and sustainable management in these ecosystems can be improved in the future.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs12172684,{},included,NA
Factors Affecting Farmer Adoption Of Remotely Sensed Imagery For Precision Management In Cotton Production,"This research evaluated the factors that influenced cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) producers to adopt remote sensing for variable-rate application of inputs. A logit model estimated with data from a 2005 mail survey of cotton producers in 11 southern USA states was used to evaluate the adoption of remote sensing. The most frequently made management decisions using remote sensing were the application of plant growth regulators, the identification of drainage problems and the management of harvest aids. A producer who was younger, more highly educated and had a larger farm with irrigated cotton was more likely to adopt remote sensing. In addition, farmers who used portable computers in fields and produced their own map-based prescriptions had a greater probability of using remote sensing. The results suggest that value-added map-making services from imagery providers greatly increased the likelihood of a farmer being a user of remote sensing.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11119-008-9065-1,{},included,NA
The Benefits Of Remote Sensing For Energy Policy,"A strong remote sensing regime is a necessary component of any contemporary national or international energy policy. Energy is essential to the functioning of modern industrial society, and as such it is the responsibility of governments to produce sound national energy policies in order to ensure stable economic growth, ecologically responsible use of energy resources and the health and safety of citizens. Comprehensive, accurate and timely remote sensing data can aid decision making on energy matters in several areas. This paper looks at the benefits that can be realized in resource exploration, weather forecasting and environmental monitoring. Improvements in the technology of remote sensing platforms would be of great value to buyers of energy, sellers of energy and the environment. Furthermore, the utility of such information could be enhanced by efforts of government agencies to communicate it more effectively to the end-user. National energy policies should thus include investments not only in satellite system hardware to collect data, but also in the services required to interpret and distribute the data.

A Global Vision For Monitoring Ecosystem Services With Satellite Sensors,"Ecosystem services can be defined as âan activity or function of an ecosystem that provides benefit (or occasionally detriment) to humansâ (Mace et al. 2012; see also Burkhard et al. 2012; Crossman et al. 2012). Repeated efforts have been made to quantify, value, map, monitor, and analyze the various ecosystem service components that sustain human well-being: from the early attempts of Costanza et al. (1997) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005) to the more recent integrative initiatives of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2013) and the Global System for Monitoring Ecosystem Service Change (Tallis et al. 2012; GEO BON ES 2013). The latter initiatives join more than 50 international organizations and 80 governmental representations under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations in order to develop the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Their aim is to compile extensive and standard monitoring of multiple services to allow policymakers and scientists to explore, better understand, and prioritize trade-offs across socioecological settings and scales (from the national to the global level). The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) identified four main sources of data: national statistics, field-based observations, remote sensing, and numerical simulation models (Tallis et al. 2012). Of these, remote sensing offers the potential to use the same standard protocols from local to global scales and through time, which is essential for long-term monitoring and for trade-off assessment across regions. Satellite-based earth observation is probably the most economically feasible means to systematically retrieve global information with high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution over large areas (Ayanu et al. 2012). Decline in the cost involved in obtaining such data and increase in the computational power of higher resolution sensors to cope with larger data sets will maximize this advantage (Kreuter et al. 2001).

Application Of The Remote-Sensing Communication Model To A Time-Sensitive Wildfire Remote-Sensing System,"Remote sensing for hazard response requires a priori identification of sensor, transmission, processing, and distribution methods to permit the extraction of relevant information in timescales sufficient to allow managers to make a given time-sensitive decision. This study applies and demonstrates the utility of the Remote Sensing Communication Model (RSCM) to improve a tactical wildfire remote-sensing system to better meet the time-sensitive information requirements of emergency response managers in San Diego County, USA. A thermal infrared airborne remote-sensing system designed and operated by the United States Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for active wildfire monitoring is documented and updated based on the RSCM. Analysis of the thermal infrared remote-sensing system in the context of the RSCM identified three configuration changes that can improve the effectiveness of the information produced when employed by wildfire incident commanders for suppression prioritization: (1) limit spectral sampling collection to a single waveband; (2) complete image processing steps on-board the aircraft; and (3) provide information on wildfire locations to incident commanders in the form of a static map.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431161.2016.1196840,{},included,NA
"Measuring Conservation Value At Fine And Broad Scales: Implications For A Diverse And Fragmented Region, The Agulhas Plain","This study explores the implications of spatial scale for conservation planning in the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Regional planning relies on broad-scale data but fine-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level. This study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for fine-scale implementation. Two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using C-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning. The first conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large-planning units defined by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha). The second system was identified at a finer scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the field), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha). Using classification trees, this study compared reserve-design efficiency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns,of conservation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales. A similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identified using minimum set analysis) at the broad and fine scale. There was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of fine-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan. However, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the fine scale. The use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a fine scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape. The implications of moving from broad- to fine-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective benefits are discussed. Maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and fine-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.

Applications Of Remote Sensing To Precision Agriculture With Dual Economic And Environmental Benefits,"In the U.S. Northern Great Plains, growing seasons are short but extremely productive. Farms and ranches are large, so many of precision agriculture's early adopters reside in the region. Crop yield maps at season's end reveal sizable variations across fields. Farm management relying upon uniform chemical applications is ineffective and wasteful. We provided information about crop and range status in near-real-time, so that in-season decisions could be made to optimize final yields and minimize environmental degradation. We created learning communities, in which information is shared among scientists, farmers, ranchers, and data providers. The new information for agricultural producers was satellite and aerial imagery. Value-added information was derived from ETM+, AVHRR, IKONOS, and MODIS sensors. The emphasis was on reducing the time between acquisition of data by a satellite and delivery of value-added products to farmers and ranchers. To distribute large spatial data sets in short times to rural users we relied upon satellite transmission (Direct PC). Results include: (1) management zone delineation, (2) variable-rate fertilizer applications, (3) weed detection, (4) irrigation efficiency determination, (5) detection of insect infestation, (6) specification of crop damage due to inadvertent chemical application, and (7) determination of livestock carrying capacities on rangelands.",NA,NA,10.1117/12.454211,{},included,NA

Translation Of Remote Sensing Data Into Weed Management Decisions,"Remote sensing and associated spatial technologies provide tremendous opportunity to enhance weed management and improve-protect the environment through judicious use of the most efficacious control methods for a given site. They can also be invaluable assets for detection of invasions, assessment of infestation levels, monitoring rate of spread, and determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts for weed management. In combination with other technologies such as global positioning systems and geographic information systems, sampling strategies can be devised to efficiently determine the location of weed populations in agricultural and wildland situations. Maps created from remote sensing or sampling (or both) allow site-specific weed management of only the areas requiring corrective action. Potential benefits to the land managers and the ecosystem as a whole will come from reductions in inputs, reduced environmental liability from the detrimental effects of applying control measures to entire areas, crop yield increases through better management decisions, and early detection and effective management of invading species. Improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, temporal frequency, image turnaround time, and cost of image acquisition, combined with the realization of the value of the data, are enhancing the acceptance and usage of remote sensing technologies. However, remote sensing will be best used by providing accurate, site-specific data that can be converted into information used by decision support systems (DSSs). Advances in these DSSs, and their ability to incorporate remote sensing data, have been rapid and widespread in the past 10 yr. As a result, federal management and research agencies, academic institutions, and private entities have collectively developed efforts to use this information in monitoring and management efforts for invasive species in western rangelands, aquatic ecosystems and forestry, and site-specific weed management in agronomics.",NA,NA,10.1614/ws-04-072r1,{},included,NA

Willingness To Pay For An Early Warning System For Infectious Diseases,"Early warning systems for infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks are designed with the aim of increasing the health safety of citizens. As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate peopleâs willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was â¬21.80 (median â¬10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80â90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks. However, our results have to be interpreted in light of the usual drawbacks of willingness to pay experiments. Â© 2020, The Author(s).",NA,NA,10.1007/s10198-020-01171-2,{},included,NA
Geospatial Information Contribution To Land Use Planning Evidence From Land Cover And Ecosystem Services Maps,"This paper aims to investigate the extent to which ecosystem services maps can improve land-use planning decisions by strengthening the consideration of environmental issues. The methodology used is based on an experimental workshop simulating a participatory decision-making process for planning choices by a panel of territorial actors. The protocol of the workshop consists in comparing the choices of location of new areas to be urbanized based firstly on a fine land cover map and secondly, by using a sample of ecosystem services maps. The results show the participants' interest in having ecosystem service maps for planning decision making.

An Active Service Recommendation Model For Multi-Source Remote Sensing Information Using Fusion Of Attention And Multi-Perspective,"With the development and popularization of remote sensing earth observation technology and the remote sensing satellite system, the problems of insufficient proactiveness, relevance and timeliness of large-scale remote sensing supporting services are increasingly prominent, which seriously restricts the application of remote sensing resources in multi-domain and cross-disciplinary. It is urgent to help terminal users make appropriate decisions according to real-time network environment and domain requirements, and obtain the optimal resources efficiently from the massive remote sensing resources. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm using fusion of attention and multi-perspective (MRS_AMRA). Based on MRS_AMRA, we further implement an active service recommendation model (MRS_ASRM) for massive multi-source remote sensing resources by combining streaming pushing technology. Firstly, we construct value evaluation functions from multi-perspective in terms of remote sensing users, data and services to enable the adaptive provision of remote sensing resources. Then, we define multi-perspective heuristic policies to support resource discovery, and fusion these policies through the attention network, to achieve the accurate pushing of remote sensing resources. Finally, we implement comparative experiments to simulate accurate recommendation scenarios, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as DIN and Geoportal. Furthermore, MRS_AMRA achieves an average improvement of 10.5% in the recommendation accuracy NDCG@K, and in addition, we developed a prototype system to verify the effectiveness and timeliness of MRS_ASRM.

A Multi-Scale Assessment Of Fire Scar Mapping In The Great Victoria Desert Of Western Australia,"Fire management is increasingly acknowledged as a necessary tool to maintain diversity in desert environments such as the Great Victoria Desert of Australia, but it needs to be informed by accurate fire history data. We compared and assessed the utility of Landsat-derived and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived burnt area mapping (30 m and 250 m resolution, respectively) for sub-regional, landscape and habitat scale management. We did so by using Sentinel-2-derived, 10 m resolution, burnt area mapping as a reference, to determine the most appropriate product to support land management planning. At the landscape scale, Landsat had significantly lower average omission and commission errors (3.4\% and 8.0\%, respectively) compared with that of MODIS (42.2\% and 19.9\%, respectively). At the habitat scale, Landsat burnt area percentage was more accurate, in plots of 500 m x 500 m (root mean square error (RMSE) 0.6\% to 8.6\%), but offered lower accuracy when estimating partially burnt habitat plots of 120 m x 120 m (RMSE 14.1\% to 23.9\%). Only Landsat-derived fire scar mapping provided enough detail to produce reliable fire history maps to inform fire management and biodiversity conservation operations at a sub-regional scale, landscape scale and a habitat scale of 500 m by 500 m.",NA,NA,10.1071/wf21019,{},included,NA
Benchmarking Optical/Thermal Satellite Imagery For Estimating Evapotranspiration And Soil Moisture In Decision Support Tools,"Generally, one expects evapotranspiration (ET) maps derived from optical/thermal Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery to improve decision support tools and lead to superior decisions regarding water resources management. However, there is lack of supportive evidence to accept or reject this expectation. We benchmark three existing hydrologic decision support tools with the following benchmarks: annual ET for the ET Toolbox developed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, predicted rainfall-runoff hydrographs for the Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis model developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the average annual groundwater recharge for the Distributed Parameter Watershed Model used by Daniel B. Stephens \& Associates. The conclusion of this benchmark study is that the use of NASA/USGS optical/thermal satellite imagery can considerably improve hydrologic decision support tools compared to their traditional implementations. The benefits of improved decision making, resulting from more accurate results of hydrologic support systems using optical/thermal satellite imagery, should substantially exceed the costs for acquiring such imagery and implementing the remote sensing algorithms. In fact, the value of reduced error in estimating average annual groundwater recharge in the San Gabriel Mountains, California alone, in terms of value of water, may be as large as \$1 billion, more than sufficient to pay for one new Landsat satellite.",NA,NA,10.1111/1752-1688.12371,{},included,NA

Estimating The Benefits Of Land Imagery In Environmental Applications: A Case Study In Nonpoint Source Pollution Of Groundwater,"Moderate-resolution land imagery (MRLI) is crucial to a more complete assessment of the cumulative, landscape-level effect of agricultural land use and land cover on environmental quality. If this improved assessment yields a net social benefit, then that benefit reflects the value of information (VOI) from MRLI. Environmental quality and the capacity to provide ecosystem services evolve because of human actions, changing natural conditions, and their interaction with natural physical processes. The human actions, in turn, are constrained and redirected by many institutions and regulations such as agricultural, energy, and environmental policies. We present a general framework for bringing together sociologic, biologic, physical, hydrologic, and geologic processes at meaningful scales to interpret environmental implications of MRLI applications. We set out a specific application using MRLI observations to identify crop planting patterns and thus estimate surface management activities that influence groundwater resources over a regional landscape. We tailor the application to the characteristics of nonpoint source groundwater pollution hazards in Iowa to illustrate a general framework in a land use-hydrologic-economic system. In the example, MRLI VOI derives from reducing the risk of both losses to agricultural production and damage to human health and other consequences of contaminated groundwater.

An Ecosystem Model And Content Research Of The Satellite Information Utilization Business,"Satellite-derived data is collected by observing the Earth and is used in various fields such as national defense, natural disasters, location-based services, infrastructure, environment, energy, marine, and insurance. This study aims to present the virtuous cycle structure of the satellite information data industry and the business ecosystem model of the industry. As a research method, cases were collected and categorized from the following areas: literature, online, application, and content. The results show that the ecosystem model of the satellite information data industry provides an approach to content services in public and commercial areas, and develops various algorithmic technologies to facilitate content production and services at the level of complex general-purpose technologies. Second, in terms of content typology, satellite information data can be subdivided into monitoring content, urban space monitoring content, and satellite information content. Third, the consumption value of satellite content could be subdivided into informational value, environmental, social and governance (ESG) value, educational value, and content value. In order to expand the global content market, Korea will need to focus on creating an ecosystem for the satellite information industry and discovering differentiated content. It will also need to increase the popularization and accessibility of data to the general public and promote the Korean K-Satellite Information Data Industry ecosystem through government support, policy efforts, and policies such as establishing legal systems, increasing investment, and training human resources.",NA,NA,10.7780/kjrs.2023.39.5.4.2,{},included,NA
Exploring The Utility Of Bathymetry Maps Derived With Multispectral Satellite Observations In The Field Of Underwater Archaeology,"Bathymetry maps derived with satellite-based multispectral sensors have been used extensively for environmental and engineering coastal studies and monitoring. However, so far this technique has not been widely exploited in other coastal applications, such as underwater archaeology. Submerged settlements and shipwrecks are often located in water depths where the application of multispectral satellite data is feasible. This could lead to more efficient field work practices thus enabling more optimal allocations of costs and labour during archaeological excavations. This study explores the contribution of processed satellite bathymetry maps to the recording of two archaeological coastal sites: a submerged prehistoric settlement in Greece and a shipwreck of a modern cargo vessel in Italy. The results indicate that even though the accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry is high, the level of detail (spatial resolution) is not sufficient to fully replace field-based measurements. However, the use of satellite data complements the existing techniques and can help to place the archaeological sites within a broader spatial context as well as to efficiently monitor the deterioration of a site due to natural causes or human activity, which inevitably leads to risk management. When the study of larger objects is involved (for example First World War shipwrecks) the potential of using satellite data in underwater archaeological studies becomes more promising.",NA,NA,10.1515/opar-2016-0018,{},included,NA
Wetland Extent Tools For Sdg 6.6.1 Reporting From The Satellite-Based Wetland Observation Service (Swos),"Wetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration. Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users. The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach. We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111892,{},included,NA
"Farmer Perception, Recollection, And Remote Sensing In Weather Index Insurance: An Ethiopia Case Study","A challenge in addressing climate risk in developing countries is that many regions have extremely limited formal data sets, so for these regions, people must rely on technologies like remote sensing for solutions. However, this means the necessary formal weather data to design and validate remote sensing solutions do not exist. Therefore, many projects use farmers' reported perceptions and recollections of climate risk events, such as drought. However, if these are used to design risk management interventions such as insurance, there may be biases and limitations which could potentially lead to a problematic product. To better understand the value and validity of farmer perceptions, this paper explores two related questions: (1) Is there evidence that farmers reporting data have any information about actual drought events, and (2) is there evidence that it is valuable to address recollection and perception issues when using farmer-reported data? We investigated these questions by analyzing index insurance, in which remote sensing products trigger payments to farmers during loss years. Our case study is perhaps the largest participatory farmer remote sensing insurance project in Ethiopia. We tested the cross-consistency of farmer-reported seasonal vulnerabilities against the years reported as droughts by independent satellite data sources. We found evidence that farmer-reported events are independently reflected in multiple remote sensing datasets, suggesting that there is legitimate information in farmer reporting. Repeated community-based meetings over time and aggregating independent village reports over space lead to improved predictions, suggesting that it may be important to utilize methods to address potential biases.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs10121887,{},included,NA
Cost-Effectiveness Of Conservation Strategies Implemented In Boreal Forests: The Area Selection Process,"To protect land from commercial exploitation is a common conservation practice. However, this requires large financial resources and it is therefore important to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies used in the selection of these conservation areas. In this study we compare four strategies and relate the differences in cost-effectiveness to differences in the selection process. We measure conservation benefits both as the amount of three tree structures and as the number of species in three species groups. We also estimate both the information cost associated with selecting conservation areas and the opportunity cost. we found the key habitat strategy to be the over-all most cost-effective. in this strategy, the areas have a flexible size and are selected by the authorities in a national field survey. The least cost-effective strategy was one where the selection was based only on forest classes in a satellite map. Intermediate were the retention group strategy, where small areas are left by the forest owner at harvesting, and the nature reserve strategy, where large areas are selected by the authorities. We emphasize that the differences we found are associated with the selection process and that other aspects, such as long-term survival of species, may rank the strategies differently. We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of a selection strategy depends on the size of the planning area for selection of conservation areas, the size of the conservation areas, the objective of the agent making the selection, and the amount and type of information on which the selection is based.

Integrating Indigenous Ecological Knowledge And Multi-Spectral Image Classification For Marine Habitat Mapping In Oceania,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of integrating indigenous ecological knowledge and remote sensing analyses to produce tropical marine habitat maps. Fishers from Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, visually interpreted a Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral satellite image to identify shallow-water marine environments. Their assessments were used to direct a supervised classification of the image and create habitat maps with indigenously defined habitat classes. Results show that these participatory remote sensing techniques produce,accurate broad-scale marine habitat maps that can be useful to managers and decision makers. Participatory methods that draw from indigenous habitat definitions also have the potential benefit of generating new insights about socio-ecological processes and enhancing local acceptance and understanding of conservation projects by allowing stakeholders to actively contribute in management planning.

Impact Of Satellite Imagery Spatial Resolution On Land Use Classification Accuracy And Modeled Water Quality,"Remote sensing offers an increasingly wide array of imagery with a broad variety of spectral and spatial resolution, but there are relatively few comparisons of how different sources of data impact the accuracy, cost, and utility of analyses. We evaluated the impact of satellite image spatial resolution (1m from Digital Globe; 30m from Landsat) on land use classification via ArcGIS Feature Analyst, and on total suspended solids (TSS) load estimates from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Camboriu watershed in Southeastern Brazil. We independently calibrated SWAT models, using both land use map resolutions and short-term daily streamflow (discharge) and TSS load data from local gauge stations. We then compared the predicted TSS loads with monitoring data outside the model training period. We also estimated the cost difference for land use classification and SWAT model construction and calibration at these two resolutions. Finally, we assessed the value of information (VOI) of the higher-resolution imagery in estimating the cost-effectiveness of watershed conservation in reducing TSS at the municipal water supply intake. Land use classification accuracy was 82.3\% for 1m data and 75.1\% for 30m data. We found that models using 1m data better predicted both annual and peak TSS loads in the full study area, though the 30m model did better in a sub-watershed. However, the 1m data incurred considerably higher costs relative to the 30m data (\$7000 for imagery, plus additional analyst time). Importantly, the choice of spatial resolution affected the estimated return on investment (ROI) in watershed conservation for the municipal water company that finances much of this conservation, although it is unlikely that this would have affected the company's decision to invest in the program. We conclude by identifying key criteria to assist in choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for different contexts.",NA,NA,10.1002/rse2.61,{},included,NA
Using Remote Sensing Data For Earthquake Damage Assessment In Afghanistan: The Role Of The International Charter,"Afghanistan is located in a zone of high-seismic activity. Given the rugged and mountainous nature of the country and the location of villages, towns and cities, there is propensity for widespread death and destruction due to landslides whenever an earthquake occurs. Use of satellite imagery by humanitarian agencies in Afghanistan in preparation for and response to natural and man-made disasters has been very limited, mostly to International organizations such as the United Nations. Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) due to their vantage position have demonstrated their ability to rapidly provide vital information and services in a disaster situation. EOS has been used in emergency situations where the ground resources are often lacking. The perception amongst humanitarian agencies and civil protection authorities in most developing countries is that the cost of satellite imagery is not cheap. With limited budgets available for purchasing satellite data, they tend to opt for less expensive solutions such as interagency survey teams to assess damages. The rugged and mountainous nature of Afghanistan and the lack of roads in most parts of the country, survey teams are most often hampered, leading to delays in delivery of information from the field to the decision makers. Recent earthquake in the Hindu Kush of the country in April 2004 witnessed the triggering of the International Charter for free delivery of satellite imagery. Image analysis and interpretation of both pre and crisis data did not show observable features of damages. The damage assessment maps were used by the humanitarian community for decision-making. Availability and access to space technology in addressing natural disasters have been the main obstacles facing developing countries particularly those poor countries without their own space programs. This problem has been solved through the introduction of The International Charter for major disasters. However, knowledge about the Charter is not common knowledge in most developing countries; Disaster Management Authorities, the Academic Institutions, humanitarian agencies and the affected communities have very little idea about the availability and access to free satellite imagery. There is need for a massive awareness campaign to educate decision makers about the International Charter and the potentials of using space technology in addressing problems relating to disaster management and the environment. The skills to process satellite imagery and integrate it with other GIS layers are lacking in most developing countries; there is need to embark on a massive capacity building exercise to ensure optimization of the benefits of the technology. The Charter needs to find innovative ways of quickly sending value added information products to disaster management authorities instead of relying on in-country skills in image processing. This paper elaborates on the experiences gained working with images received from the International Charter, and the immense pressures from the humanitarian community for rapid delivery of information.

How Much Would You Pay For A Satellite Image?: Lessons Learned From French Spatial-Data Infrastructure,"Satellite imagery is increasingly employed for land-use analysis and planning. In this article, we examine the economic value of high-resolution (HR) satellite images as perceived by direct users. Drawing on a French spatial-data infrastructure (SDI), the direct users of which are mostly from public bodies, we used a contingent-valuation method to evaluate their willingness to pay (WTP) for satellite imagery. A clear understanding of the value of these images is critical for justifying the large investments made in this sector and supporting policies that aim to develop and sustain these resources. We analyzed the differences in the stated values according to the various types of users. A survey of the registered users on the Geo Information for Sustainable Development (GEOSUD) platform found a mean value of \& euro;1,696 for a 60 \& times; 60-km(2) HR image. Charging this amount leads to an acceptance rate of 43\%, with 57\% of users no longer acquiring the imagery. Furthermore, we noticed significant differences in values for images among the sectors. The results show that users are more willing to pay a fixed yearly amount to join an HR-image pooling system than to be charged per image. Hence, we recorded a mean membership value of \& euro;3,022, with 12\% of users willing to pay up to \& euro;15,000 to join such a service. For the 7,500 HR images available on the platform, the total user benefits amount to \& euro;12.7 million.",NA,NA,10.1109/mgrs.2019.2941751,{},included,NA
Assessing The Benefit Of Satellite-Based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence In Crop Yield Prediction,"Large-scale crop yield prediction is critical for early warning of food insecurity, agricultural supply chain management, and economic market. Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jag.2020.102126,"{""probs not""}",included,NA
Geometric Accuracy Assessment Of Very High-Resolution Optical Data Orthorectified Using Terrasar-X Dsm To Support Disaster Management In Indonesia,"Advanced remote sensing satellite data with detail spatial resolution can be an alternative to aerial photography and outweigh in providing rapid and vast spatial, remote area, and consist of multispectral bands to produce continues information. The various types of very high spatial resolution satellite, benefit in producing information for large-scale mappings, such as updating an urban map and supporting disaster management for mitigation, preparedness, emergency response, and recovery effectively and efficiently. Large-scale mapping information for disaster management, particularly for quick response is essential to map the impacted sites, measure the number of houses and infrastructure damaged and determine the evacuation area. However, in producing large-scale mapping, the information should refer to the geospatial specification standard, such as accurate geometric, detail thematic information and completeness. This study aims to identify the use of Pleiades imagery for supporting large-scale mapping, including for disaster management by assessing the geometry accuracy from a standard product acquired from the ground station and precise orthorectification using different types of DSM, including TerraSAR-X and improvement using ground control points. The results show that the improved accuracy to meet geometric accuracy standard for scale 1:5000 can be achieved using a primary product data which process using an insertion of GCPs and selecting the better DSM, while for the standard ortho product can be achieved using shifting the coordinate position of the image. Assessment of the thematic extraction visually shows that the imagery meets the information for large-scale mapping, but detail attribution requires information from field data.

A Generic Self-Supervised Learning (Ssl) Framework For Representation Learning From Spectral-Spatial Features Of Unlabeled Remote Sensing Imagery,"Remote sensing data has been widely used for various Earth Observation (EO) missions such as land use and cover classification, weather forecasting, agricultural management, and environmental monitoring. Most existing remote-sensing-data-based models are based on supervised learning that requires large and representative human-labeled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming. The recent introduction of self-supervised learning (SSL) enables models to learn a representation from orders of magnitude more unlabeled data. The success of SSL is heavily dependent on a pre-designed pretext task, which introduces an inductive bias into the model from a large amount of unlabeled data. Since remote sensing imagery has rich spectral information beyond the standard RGB color space, it may not be straightforward to extend to the multi/hyperspectral domain the pretext tasks established in computer vision based on RGB images. To address this challenge, this work proposed a generic self-supervised learning framework based on remote sensing data at both the object and pixel levels. The method contains two novel pretext tasks, one for object-based and one for pixel-based remote sensing data analysis methods. One pretext task is used to reconstruct the spectral profile from the masked data, which can be used to extract a representation of pixel information and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with pixel-based analysis. The second pretext task is used to identify objects from multiple views of the same object in multispectral data, which can be used to extract a representation and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with object-based analysis. The results of two typical downstream task evaluation exercises (a multilabel land cover classification task on Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and a ground soil parameter retrieval task on hyperspectral datasets) demonstrate that the proposed SSL method learns a target representation that covers both spatial and spectral information from massive unlabeled data. A comparison with currently available SSL methods shows that the proposed method, which emphasizes both spectral and spatial features, outperforms existing SSL methods on multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. We believe that this approach has the potential to be effective in a wider range of remote sensing applications and we will explore its utility in more remote sensing applications in the future.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15215238,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Space As An Enabler In The Maritime Sector,"Space can be used as a tool for business decision and policy makers. The maritime sector is rapidly evolving as far as business and industrial activities are concerned. Space can assist in transforming this sector through satellite navigation and positioning, telecommunications and integrated applications as well as earth observation. Additionally, space can be used as a tool in developing, implementing maritime affairs. This paper focuses on the role of space in maritime policy. Space technologies have been serving the maritime community for over fourty years. Satellite technology is becoming increasingly important for a wide range of maritime activities through enhanced navigation accuracy, marine environmental monitoring and maritime surveillance. For this reason, agreements between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), have been signed in 2007 and 2010, strengthening the framework for cooperation between the two agencies for the use of space-based systems in support of maritime activities. The first part of the paper summarizes European maritime related policy areas where space assets can contribute to achieve their objectives. The second part of the paper addresses how ESA's initiatives and programs could contribute and support the maritime sector in Europe. The main purpose of this paper is to come up with conclusions on whether and how the use of space assets, technology and applications, can contribute in achieving the maritime policy objectives for the benefit of Europe.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2019.06.017,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Structural Health Monitoring Of Oil And Gas Pipelines Through Internet Of Remote Things,"Internet of Things paradigm via satellite communication acts as a great aspect inenterprising the perception for an universe which is coupled genuinely. Satellites provide wall to wall broadcasting and authenticity in all the localities including remote locations that canât be accessed through terrestrial access networks. This indicates there is kinship in most of the secluded areas such that they can work in the atmosphere and in the sea premises, permitting their applications beyond distinct barter sections. The objective of this paper is to use IoT through satellite articulation for structural monitoring of Oil and gas pipe lines.

Valuation Of Ecotourism Resources Using A Contingent Valuation Method: The Case Of The Korean Dmz,"The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has been untouched by human interference for the last half century, has become a sanctuary for rare species of animals and plants. Conflicts concerning development between communities and environmentalists are arising. Estimates of the preservation value of the DMZ are necessary for society to properly address these issues. Such estimates will help policy-makers address issues of conservation management, sustainable development, and public financial support. Given this situation, the objectives are two-fold. The primary objective of this study is to obtain estimates of the preservation value of the Korean DMZ and Civilian Control Zone (CCZ). A secondary objective is to examine the potential for hypothetic bias in respondents' answers in a contingent valuation method framework. Findings suggest hypothetical bias is present in the survey. including a real payment vehicle may reduce hypothetical bias in eliciting willingness-to-pay (WTP). Best estimates are the mean WTP is US \$ 16.74 per capita. Aggregate preservation value lies between US \$264 and \$602 million. These findings indicate that conservation of the DMZ and CCZ is not only important for moral and ecological reasons, but the DMZ and CCZ are of considerable economic value to South Koreans. Any development unfriendly to the environment will degrade the quality of the ecosystem of the DMZ, as well as, decrease its economic value. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Review Of State-Of-The-Art Decision Support Systems (Dsss) For Prevention And Suppression Of Forest Fires,"Forest ecosystems are our priceless natural resource and are a key component of the global carbon budget. Forest fires can be a hazard to the viability and sustainable management of forests with consequences for natural and cultural environments, economies, and the life quality of local and regional populations. Thus, the selection of strategies to manage forest fires, while considering both functional and economic efficiency, is of primary importance. The use of decision support systems (DSSs) by managers of forest fires has rapidly increased. This has strengthened capacity to prevent and suppress forest fires while protecting human lives and property. DSSs are a tool that can benefit incident management and decision making and policy, especially for emergencies such as natural disasters. In this study we reviewed state-of-the-art DSSs that use: database management systems and mathematical/economic algorithms for spatial optimization of firefighting forces; forest fire simulators and satellite technology for immediate detection and prediction of evolution of forest fires; GIS platforms that incorporate several tools to manipulate, process and analyze geographic data and develop strategic and operational plans.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11676-017-0452-1,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
A Review Of Property Rights In Outer Space From A Land Management Perspective,"Purpose - In light of the discussions on outer space property management, this conceptual review paper aims to discuss and evaluate if, when and under which conditions certain land management and property right frameworks can apply to allocate and/or restrict property rights in outer space. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applies a pragmatic review approach which seeks to better understand if and how the basic tenets of the land management frameworks could better shape and revise the challenges in outer space regulations. Findings - Despite the fact that regulatory guidelines on outer space rights are existing, the analysis shows that these lack a number of practical tools and measures aiming at intervening if stakeholders do not follow the rules. With the use of land management frameworks, it is possible to derive policy options for making the outer space management more practical and action-oriented, in particular for the removal of space debris. These include amongst others more attention for formulating global public restrictions in outer space, incorporating regulatory guidelines for accessing open space regimes, addressing responsiveness and robustness in adherence and compliance to regulations Research limitations/implications - Given the conceptual and discursive character of the paper, there are no specific empirical data, yet several recommendations for further research include expanding the boundary work between the land management and regulatory outer space domain. Practical implications - The insights derived from land management and real estate related property theories could potentially provide new starting points for (re)formulating the regulatory framework for outer space property discourses. Social implications - Interpreting the outer space regulations from known and practiced land management perspective helps to bridge the policy-society knowledge and necessity gap on outer space activities.

"A Framework For Assessing Readiness Of Satellite Assembly, Integration And Testing Organization","Purpose: The success of satellites in orbit depends on the quality of the engineering processes adopted in the development cycle of the mission. The facilities and processes provided by Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) laboratories support the verification and validation of satellite' systems regarding their capacities to operating into space environmental conditions. Choose an ideal AIT organization to a particular satellite project requires knowing their processes and services provided. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the services for satellite AIT provided by an AIT organization. The framework, named PRONT-AIT, allows to assess the organization's readiness based on both process areas and criteria of adherence to the stakeholder's requirements. Methodology/approach - Inspired by the CMMI model, the framework was structured in process areas, covering management and technical processes of the AIT organization, that supports 5 levels of readiness. Each readiness level expresses the organization maturity in terms of the processes and practices established to provide the services required by a particular space project. Findings - The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its use to assess the readiness of a particular AIT organization on meeting the specific requirements of two types of satellites: remote sensing and CubeSat satellites. The results reveal that the example organization readiness fully reached level 2 (Manageable Readiness) for remote sensing satellite and partially reached level 2 for CubeSat satellite.

Improved Classification Of Conservation Tillage Adoption Using High Temporal And Synthetic Satellite Imagery,"Conservation tillage management has been advocated for carbon sequestration and soil quality preservation purposes. Past satellite image analyses have had difficulty in differentiating between no-till (NT) and minimal tillage (MT) conservation classes due to similarities in surface residues, and may have been restricted by the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery. This study hypothesized that the inclusion of high temporal data into the classification process would increase conservation tillage accuracy due to the added likelihood of capturing spectral changes in MT fields following a tillage disturbance. Classification accuracies were evaluated for Random Forest models based on 250-m and 500-m MODIS, 30-m Landsat, and 30-m synthetic reflectance values. Synthetic (30-m) data derived from the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) were evaluated because high frequency Landsat image sets are often unavailable within a cropping season due to cloud issues. Classification results from a five-date Landsat model were substantially better than those reported by previous classification tillage studies, with 94\% total and >= 88\% class producer's accuracies. Landsat-derived models based on individual image scenes (May through August) yielded poor MT classifications, but a monthly increase in accuracy illustrated the importance of temporal sampling for capturing regional tillage disturbance signatures. MODIS-based model accuracies (90\% total; >= 82\% class) were lower than in the five-date Landsat model, but were higher than previous image-based and survey-based tillage classification results. Almost all the STARFM prediction-based models had classification accuracies higher than, or comparable to, the MODIS-based results (>90\% total; >= 84\% class) but the resulting model accuracies were dependent on the MODIS/Landsat base pairs used to generate the STARFM predictions. Also evident within the STARFM prediction-based models was the ability for high frequency data series to compensate for degraded synthetic spectral values when classifying field-based tillage. The decision to use MODIS or STARFM-based data within conservation tillage analysis is likely situation dependent. A MODIS-based approach requires little data processing and could be more efficient for large-area mapping; however a STARFM-based analysis might be more appropriate in mixed-pixel situations that could potentially compromise classification accuracy.

Incorporating A Constrained Optimization Algorithm Into Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture Methodology,"For two decades now, the use of Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture to improve farm yields while reducing the use of polluting chemicals and the limited water supply has been a major goal. With world population growing exponentially, arable land being consumed by urbanization, and an unfavorable farm economy, farm efficiency must increase to meet future food requirements and to make farming a sustainable, profitable occupation. ""Precision Agriculture"" refers to a farming methodology that applies nutrients and moisture only where and when they are needed in the field. The real goal is to increase farm profitability by identifying the additional treatments of chemicals and water that increase revenues more than they increase costs and do no exceed pollution standards (constrained optimization). Even though the economic and environmental benefits appear to be great, Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture has not grown as rapidly as early advocates envisioned. Technology for a successful Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture system is now in place, but other needed factors have been missing. Commercial satellite systems can now image the Earth (multi-spectrally) with a resolution as fine as 2.5 in. Precision variable dispensing systems using GPS are now available and affordable. Crop models that predict yield as a function of soil, chemical, and irrigation parameter levels have been developed. Personal computers and internet access are now in place in most farm homes and can provide a mechanism for periodically disseminating advice on what quantities of water and chemicals are needed in specific regions of each field. Several processes have been selected that fuse the disparate sources of information on the current and historic states of the crop and soil, and the remaining resource levels available, with the critical decisions that farmers are required to make. These are done in a way that is easy for the farmer to understand and profitable to implement. A ""Constrained Optimization Algorithm"" to further improve these processes will be presented. The objective function of the model will be used to maximize the farmer's profit via increasing yields while decreasing environmental damage and decreasing applications of costly treatments. This model will incorporate information from Remote Sensing, from in-situ weather sources, from soil history, and from tacit farmer knowledge of the relative productivity of selected ""Management Zones"" of the farm, to provide incremental advice throughout the growing season on the optimum usage of water and chemical treatments.

How Much Will Precision Nitrogen Management Pay Off? An Evaluation Based On Simulating Thousands Of Corn Fields Over The Us Corn-Belt,"Variable rate technology nitrogen (VRT-N) application, a precision management approach to synchronize N input with crop demand, has received increasing attention in recent years. Although existing field trials have suggested the agronomic and environmental feasibility of VRT-N adoption, the potential benefits at large scale remain a puzzle to farmers and policy-makers, partly because no tools are available for aggregated assessments. In this study, we develop a scalable framework to support large-scale precision N management by fully leveraging recent advances in crop modeling, remote sensing, and publicly available weather and soil datasets. Using this new framework, we investigated the agronomic and environmental benefits of VRT-N application for corn compared to Uniform-N application across 9 states and ca. 2600 fields in the US Corn-Belt. Our results showed that, given an Extension-reported service fee of 6.2 USD\$/ha for applying N at variable rate, the multi-year averaged mean agronomic margin of adopting VRT-N were only 6.7 \$/ha more than Uniform-N. Accounting for the environmental cost of N leaching and N2O emission increased the mean benefit of VRT-N to 26.4 \$/ha. Agronomic benefits in general increased with the yield heterogeneity in field, and the mean value was driven by a small fraction of very heterogenous fields. Additional benefits from managing the temporal variability were 29.5 \$/ha and 51.6 \$/ha on average from an agronomic and environmental perspective, respectively. Environmental benefits are considerable but are unlikely to drive farmer adoption in the absence of new incentives for precision technologies. Although various uncertainties remain to be reduced, the current framework opens opportunity to ingest future improvements in models and geospatial datasets and could serve as a foundation for other precision management practices such as seeding rate and irrigation.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.fcr.2019.04.013,"{""N appl method valued""}",excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Qoe-Driven Social Aware Caching Placement For Terrestrial-Satellite Networks,"In remote terrestrial-satellite networks, caching is a very promising technique to alleviate the burden of space cloudlet (e.g., cache-enabled satellite user terminal) and to improve subscribers' quality of experience (QoE) in terms of buffering delay and achievable video streaming rate. In this paper, we studied a QoE-driven caching placement optimization problem for video streaming that takes into account the required video streaming rate and the social relationship among users. Social ties between users are used to designate a set of helpers with caching capability, which can cache popular files pro-actively when the cloudlet is idle. We model the utility function of QoE as a logarithmic function. Then, the caching placement problem is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the user's average QoE subject to the storage capacity constraints of the helpers and the cloudlets. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem into a monotone submodular optimization problem with a partition matroid constraint, and an efficient greedy algorithm with 1 - 1/e approximation ratio is proposed to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed caching placement approach significantly outperforms the traditional approaches in terms of QoE, while yields about the same delay and hit ratio performance compare to the delay-minimized scheme.",NA,NA,10.1109/cc.2018.8485469,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Satellite Data Applications For Sustainable Energy Transitions,"Transitioning to a sustainable energy system poses a massive challenge to communities, nations, and the global economy in the next decade and beyond. A growing portfolio of satellite data products is available to support this transition. Satellite data complement other information sources to provide a more complete picture of the global energy system, often with continuous spatial coverage over targeted areas or even the entire Earth. We find that satellite data are already being applied to a wide range of energy issues with varying information needs, from planning and operation of renewable energy projects, to tracking changing patterns in energy access and use, to monitoring environmental impacts and verifying the effectiveness of emissions reduction efforts. While satellite data could play a larger role throughout the policy and planning lifecycle, there are technical, social, and structural barriers to their increased use. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for satellite data applications to energy and recommendations for research to maximize the value of satellite data for sustainable energy transitions.

Utility Of Biological Sensor Tags In Animal Conservation,"Electronic tags (both biotelemetry and biologging platforms) have informed conservation and resource management policy and practice by providing vital information on the spatial ecology of animals and their environments. However, the extent of the contribution of biological sensors (within electronic tags) that measure an animal's state (e.g., heart rate, body temperature, and details of locomotion and energetics) is less clear. A literature review revealed that, despite a growing number of commercially available state sensor tags and enormous application potential for such devices in animal biology, there are relatively few examples of their application to conservation. Existing applications fell under 4 main themes: quantifying disturbance (e.g., ecotourism, vehicular and aircraft traffic), examining the effects of environmental change (e.g., climate change), understanding the consequences of habitat use and selection, and estimating energy expenditure. We also identified several other ways in which sensor tags could benefit conservation, such as determining the potential efficacy of management interventions. With increasing sensor diversity of commercially available platforms, less invasive attachment techniques, smaller device sizes, and more researchers embracing such technology, we suggest that biological sensor tags be considered a part of the necessary toolbox for conservation. This approach can measure (in real time) the state of free-ranging animals and thus provide managers with objective, timely, relevant, and accurate data to inform policy and decision making.

Remote Sensing Of Coral Reefs For Monitoring And Management: A Review,"Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs8020118,{interesting},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Remote Sensing Of Croplands,"Mapping and monitoring of croplands is one of the most important and widely applied uses of remote sensing. Indeed, much of the technological and methodological basis for contemporary land remote sensing was initially developed to support the need for improved monitoring of croplands at local, regional, and global scales. Early field experiments, including LACIE and AgRISTARS, provided the initial proof-of-concept and methodological foundation, demonstrating the ability and utility of remote sensing for mapping a wide array of cropland attributes including crop type, crop health, crop phenology, and soil and canopy attributes. As instrumentation, computing power, and methods of analysis have improved over the last several decades, the depth, breadth, and sophistication of remote-sensing applications in both basic research and management of croplands have expanded rapidly. This chapter provides an overview of remote sensing applied to croplands, along with a survey of key literature and important applications. We provide a brief overview of the history and core applications for which remote sensing has been used in croplands, followed by a summary of key areas where remote sensing is currently most widely exploited in both basic and applied research in croplands. Key topics include remote sensing of cropland extent and type at local, regional, and global scales, biophysical remote sensing of croplands, and important specialized applications. Key thematic topics related to biophysical remote sensing of croplands include spectral properties of soils and crop canopies, spectral vegetation indices, mapping crop yields, and monitoring crop phenology. Specialized applications include irrigation mapping, field delineation, remote sensing of water use by crops, and precision agriculture. Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Populating Digital Earth: Improving Access To Chinese Remote Sensing Data For Terrestrial Applications,"Global change has a significant impact on the lives of humankind. Earth observation can help to better understand our earth and cope with global change. With the availability of more reliable environmental data sets, digital earth is becoming a popular way to monitor the Earth and provide information to researchers and decision makers on environment protection, disaster mitigation, and social benefits. Therefore, accessing data with lowering costs is essential for digital earth. Nevertheless, there are big challenges in ensuring the feasibility of access to Chinese remote sensing data. This paper outlines some of the main challenges in realizing data sharing, provides an analysis of the core reasons leading to these challenges, and proposes recommendations to overcome the challenges. Amongst the main challenges are differences in data policy to gain access to satellite data, diverse data formats, and delivery mechanisms. The major challenge for the decision makers is to define a more open policy and for the scientist the challenge is to implement these polices for the benefit of all. This paper proposes that governments should adopt policies encouraging more open distribution and access to their data, in order to generate an improved digital earth with increased benefits to human society.",NA,NA,10.1080/17538947.2013.829130,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Blockchain For Environmental Governance: Can Smart Contracts Reinforce Payments For Ecosystem Services In Namibia?,"The Global South harbors some of the planet's most precious natural resources and is hence key in addressing the pressing environmental challenges of the Anthropocene. Here, payments for ecosystem services (PES) have recently gained importance as a means of environmental governance, increasingly complementing conventional command-and-control approaches. For instance, climate change is now mitigated through carbon offset payments and biodiversity loss is addressed through wildlife conservation performance payments. However, such payment schemes in the Global South face numerous challenges as identified by a large body of literature. This paper investigates if blockchain technology can help address some of the challenges by reinforcing PES programs with tamper-proof blockchain smart contracts. To this end, the paper presents a proof-of-concept of a blockchain-based wildlife conservation performance payments scheme in Namibia: the habitat integrity of an elephant corridor is assessed by remote sensing algorithms, which in turn trigger fictitious blockchain smart contract payments to surrounding communities. The application allows to practically discuss the potential of blockchain technology regarding three key aspects of PES: (i) effectiveness (conditionality) of environmental monitoring (ii) efficiency and transaction costs, as well as (iii) equity and benefit distribution. The case presented here is an example for linking the digital Blockchain sphere to practical challenges of natural resource management in the physical world.

Revealing Preferences For Urban Biodiversity As An Environmental Good,"Biodiversity is essential for human well-being, but little is known about urban dwellers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban biodiversity. Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers' WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators. This finding is significant for benefit transfer studies and primary biodiversity valuation in regions with limited data availability.

Direct Delivery Of Remote Sensing Data To User Computer Systems Using Satellite-Based Data Broadcast Techniques,"The remote sensing applications are growing very rapidly with the availability of high-resolution data from the state of the art satellites like IRS-1C/1D/P4. The advancement in computer hardware and software in the area of remote sensing also enhance the growth of remote sensing applications. 1RS-1C/1D/P4 provides data with the resolution of 5.6m in panchromatic mode giving more information of the ground area covered. The remote sensing satellites with high-resolution sensors and wide coverage capabilities will provide the data with better resolution, coverage and revisit to meet the growing application needs. Many applications like crop acreage and yield estimation, draught monitoring and assessment, flood mapping, waste land mapping, mineral prospectus, forest resource survey etc. have become an integral part of the resources management system in the developing countries. These resource management systems need the data to be transferred in real time or near real time for processing. The transfer of data in real time or near real time calls for advanced data delivery techniques to deliver the data as quickly as possible. Processing of remote sensing data can be performed even on low cost personal computers, which in turn further increases the remote sensing applications enabling by setting up the processing centers even at grass root level i.e., at district, taluk or village level. Setting up of processing centers at grass root level demands for quick, cost effective and efficient data delivery mechanism to transfer remote sensing data with or without value added services. The digital revolution has reached broadcasting with the introduction of direct broadcasting of digital data. These modify the traditional data transfer techniques by separating the actual service from the transmission system, thus enabling the distribution of any kind of digital data to stationary, portable or mobile terminals. This allows remote sensing data to reach a large number of users simultaneously and independent of their location.

Environmental Monitoring And Landscape Design Of Green City Based On Remote Sensing Image And Improved Neural Network,"In some developed countries in Europe, cities are developing very rapidly, but the rapid development of these countries also has to go through the following stages, which are the three essential development processes of urbanization, counter-urbanization and re-urbanization. My country's development situation is relatively uneven. In the more developed areas of my country, the speed of urbanization is relatively rapid, such as cities near the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. But with the development of urbanization, these areas are also facing a very troublesome problem, that is, the balance between the development of the city and the environmental ecosystem. In order to monitor this situation, we will use remote sensing technology to conduct a comprehensive survey of the urban environmental ecosystem and analyze the impact and effect of the rapid development of the city on the changes in the ecosystem. This article will focus on the area around the Yangtze River Delta, and investigate the spatial patterns of urban environmental ecosystems by comparing this area with cities in developed regions such as Western Europe and North America. Under the conditions of different regions and different degrees of urbanization, the comprehensive situation of environmental elements in the city is investigated, and the environmental impact effects and the causes, effects and effects of environmental changes are more accurately studied. Combine the BP network model related to the nervous system in the experiment, and continuously optimize the model during the experiment. The experimental data selects environmental difference reports displayed in different years and different seasons to predict the air pollution value of a certain city. The reason why we use this method is that this model can improve the accuracy of statistical data and greatly simplify the unnecessary and complicated steps in the research process, and it can also reduce the error problems generated in the operation of the BP system, such as when we When entering a piece of data, the data obtained is often very different from the target data. Therefore, we will use the ant colony algorithm to solve the above problems, and add stereo and 3D technologies, which can monitor experiments in real time, greatly improve the speed of the experiment, and the 3D stereo technology can make the results more perceptual to meet the needs of the experiment.

"Modeling On Comparison Of Ecosystem Services Concepts, Tools, Methods And Their Ecological-Economic Implications: A Review","The paper aims to identify the gaps in the assessment and modeling of ecosystem services to help researchers, resource managers, and decision-makers develop a holistic understanding of the ecosystem service assessments' foundations. This review proposes that to efficiently assess the ecosystem services, methodologies that are region-specific and standardized in the terminologies are useful in determining the valuation component in the ecosystem services assessments' goal to explain trade-offs between development and conservation priorities for implementation of conservation policies. Ecosystem service assessments are critical for the sustainable future of Earth. Numerous scholarly studies have been conducted in the field of ecosystem services (ES) that have laid down the foundation of their valuation, mapping, and quantification. We reviewed 103 peer-reviewed publications using the SCOPUS database, perhaps the most extensive database of peer-reviewed research literature as well WoS, PUBMED, and Google Scholar databases based on certain criteria. Our review revealed that different definitions of the ES concept and the non-standardization of the economic concepts for assigning market values to the ecosystem services had shown conflicting results. Further, we also found that ES assessment methodologies depend upon the evaluation purpose and vary from qualitative approaches to modeling and integrated ones. ES assessment has considerable implications in understanding the earth's surface processes and the pursuing benefits in the form of balanced trade-offs between sustainability and development. To attain sustainable development goals, we propose shifting towards a green economy to balance the trade-off between conservation and development.",NA,NA,10.1007/s40808-021-01131-6,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
21st Century Engineering For On-Farm Food-Energy-Water Systems,"For more than a century, agricultural mechanization encouraged larger fields with more uniform management and increasing impacts on the environment. The trajectory of agricultural technology is now at an inflection point where information technology, including remote sensing, simulation modeling, decision support systems, precision agricultural technologies, and automation, enables site-specific management at small spatial scales with the potential to simultaneously enhance food and bioenergy production, farm profitability, and environmental quality. To achieve these economic and environmental benefits of transforming agricultural landscape design and cropping system management, agricultural producers need increased access to both enabling technologies and engineering expertise. Government policies and programs are also needed to incentivize changes in cropping systems that promote soil health and improve water quality, for example, payments to cover much or all of the cost of transitioning land use to perennials and nutrient trading programs in which agricultural producers contract with industrial and municipal wastewater generators to reduce nutrient loading at a reduced cost.

Predictive Mapping Of Floristic Site Conditions Across Mire Habitats: Evaluating Data Requirements,"As conservation of sensitive habitats is a high priority issue in European environmental policy, there is considerable interest in mapping and monitoring specific habitats of high conservation value. In this study, we discuss the potential of the Swiss mire monitoring program to monitor small area habitats in sufficient detail. The monitoring scheme combines nationwide probability sampling and predictive habitat mapping based on a field data sample. Thus, it is designed to identify spatio-temporal changes at the stand level and to derive hard statistics for the sub-national level. For feasibility reasons, the thematic focus is on semi-quantitative mean indicator values derived from vegetation records. These measures provide robust estimates of essential floristic site conditions. Regression models based on CIR aerial photographs are applied to continuously map respective measures across the sample mires. The present study explores the required investment of data for model-based mapping. Exemplary mapping results are presented and validated within a reference mire. Repeated tests show that about one hundred field records are needed to guarantee optimal prediction accuracy and reliable error estimates for all target variables. The corresponding 95\% error quantiles in a test data set are below 0.7. To evaluate the benefit of high resolution orthophotos (30 cm resolution), the model prediction is compared with results obtained from coarsened images. Although the original CIR images produce the best model performance, the models based on resolutions comparable to modern satellite images still show considerable potential to assess larger areas where the use of digital aerial photographs is limited. The resulting spatially-explicit in-depth information can resolve the common thematic limitations of stand-alone remote sensing applications in conservation monitoring. As the method is applicable consistently across a range of habitat types, we argue that it has the potential to become a standard method for operational monitoring of priority habitats in European nature conservation.",NA,NA,10.1556/comec.9.2008.2.2,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Application Of Water Extraction Methods From Landsat Imagery For Different Environmental Background,"Rapid and accurate extraction of water information from satellite images has been a hot issue in remote sensing applications and has important application value in water resources management, water environment monitoring, and disaster emergency management. Although there are a variety of water extraction methods for Landsat series images, the same method can generate different extraction results in different environmental backgrounds due to the influence of environmental background factors such as geographic location, topography, and water body shape. In order to study the applicability of water extraction methods under different environmental conditions, this article focuses on two typical environments: urban areas around Huairou County, Beijing with severe human influence and strong contrast between light and dark images, and non-urban areas around Beijing Miyun Reservoir with obvious topography and small water bodies. Water index method and classification method are tested based on water extraction and accuracy verification using Landsat 5 (2009) and Landsat 8 (2019) satellite images which have slightly different band settings. The water index method includes Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), while the classification method includes Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML). Our results show that SVM has the highest accuracy with overall accuracy > 97% in the urban areas. By selecting training samples reasonably and delicately, the extracted spatial pattern of water results is close to the real water distribution. It applies well to multiple-scale and complex water bodies. In the non-urban areas, SVM can completely identify the fine rivers which are usually difficult to be identified by other methods. It is also suitable for judging the shape and flow direction of small rivers between mountains, though the shadow of the mountain could be easily mixed together by mistake. Due to the difference in sensor band settings, SVM has a better performance in Landsat 8 data. MNDWI can effectively reduce the error extraction rate, resulting in an overall accuracy > 95%. It is convenient to determine the threshold value of MNDWI through visual interpretation, which is more suitable for the rapid extraction of water in the non-urban areas. The environmental background may show different effects on water body extraction. The water index method and classification method have different advantages in different environmental backgrounds. The most suitable method should vary according to the actual situation. In scenarios with higher requirements for efficiency, we should focus on the use of index method, and design a new index which can make full use of the band information. In application scenarios where higher extraction accuracy is required, classification methods can improve the accuracy of water extraction. Moreover, we cannot ignore the differences between interpretation methods in data sources from different sensors. This study provides a reference for the selection of water extraction methods under different environmental backgrounds. Â© 2021, Science Press.

Using Viirs/Npp And Modis/Aqua Data To Provide A Continuous Record Of Suspended Particulate Matter In A Highly Turbid Inland Lake,"Inland lakes are generally an important source of drinking water, and information on their water quality needs to be obtained in real time. To date, Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have played a critical, effective and long-term role in fulfilling this function. However, the MODIS instruments on board both the Terra and Aqua satellites have operated beyond their designed five-year mission lifespans (Terra was launched in 1999, whereas Aqua was launched in 2002), and these instruments may stop running at any time in the near future. The Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP, which was launched in Oct 2011) is expected to provide a consistent, long-term data record and continue the series of observations initiated by MODIS. To date, few evaluations of the consistency between VIIRS and MODIS have been conducted for turbid inland waters. In this study, we first used synchronous MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data (+/- 1 h) collected during 2012-2015 to evaluate the consistency of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) observations over Lake Hongze (the fourth-largest freshwater lake in China), since accurate remote sensing reflectance (R-rc) values cannot be acquired over turbid inland waters. Second, we used recently developed algorithms based on R-rc in the red band to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data. Finally, we assessed the consistency of the SPM products derived from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP. The results show the following. (1) The differences in Rrc among the green (VIIRS 551 nm and MODIS 555 nm) and red bands (VIIRS 671 nm and MODIS 645 nm) indicate a satisfactory consistency, and the unbiased percentage difference (UPD) is < 12\%. Meanwhile, the results for the near infrared (NIR) band (MODIS 859 nm and VIIRS 862 nm) indicate relatively large differences (UPD = 21.84\%). (2) The satellite-derived SPM products obtained using MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP have a satisfactory degree of consistency (0-150 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.81, UPD < 16\% and 0-80 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.85, UPD < 12\%, respectively). These results demonstrate that VIIRS/NPP can continue to record the SPM observations initiated by MODIS/Aqua for turbid inland waters and establish environmental datasets over long time periods to support water quality management endeavors.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.jag.2017.09.012,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Remote Sensing In The Information Age,"A large percentage of the public today perceives the majority of applications of Earth observation data from satellite and aircraft altitudes to be focused on the understanding and management of the renewable and non-renewable resources of the Earth and its environment. Originally conceived as a tool for gathering intelligence information, remote sensing has just fully emerged from its military womb to the public domain. Advances in the technology, a variety of indirect benefits that could be derived from space exploration, commercialization of remote sensing and the drive of the value-added companies - all of these hold promise for new opportunities for many other novel applications of Earth observation data and related information. In the advent of the more advanced, user-friendly, cost effective, and problem solving operations being championed by the private sector, particularly in the industrialized countries, it appears that the commercial future for remote sensing programmes and related information generated in the process is promising. This paper examines how the information age is influencing the metamorphosis of remote sensing technology particularly through international legal instruments and converging technologies. In spite of the progress attained to-date, of international concern is possible radio frequency interference between remote sensing satellite and communication satellite services. There is also a major knowledge gap between the providers of raw remote sensing data and the user community, particularly those interested in the new high-level information. A resolution of these issues will enhance the contributions of remote sensing to the information economy. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Willingness To Pay For Emergency Referral Transport In A Developing Setting: A Geographically Randomized Study,"Objectives: The objective was to identify the correlates of willingness to pay for ambulance transports from a rural city to a regional hospital in Guatemala. Methods: An innovative methodology that utilizes a novel randomization technique and satellite imagery was used to select a sample of homes in Santiago AtitlÃ¡n, Guatemala. The respondents were surveyed at these homes about their willingness to pay for ambulance transport to a regional hospital. A price ladder was used to elicit respondents' willingness to pay for ambulance transport, depending on the level of severity of three types of emergencies: life-threatening emergencies, disability-causing emergencies, and simple emergencies. Simple and multiple linear regression modeling was used to identify the social and economic correlates of respondents' willingness to pay for ambulance transport and to predict demand for ambulance transport at a variety of price levels. Beta coefficients (Î²) expressed as percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results: The authors surveyed 134 respondents (response rate = 83.3%). In the multivariable regression models, three variables correlated with willingness to pay: household income, location of residence (rural district vs. urban district), and respondents' education levels. Correlates for ambulance transport in life-threatening emergencies included greater household daily income (Î² = 1.32%, 95% CI = 0.63% to 2.56%), rural location of residence (Î² = -37.3%, 95% CI = -51.1% to -137.5%), and higher educational levels (Î² = 4.41%, 95% CI = 1.00% to 6.36%). Correlates of willingness to pay in disability-causing emergencies included greater household daily income (Î² = 1.59%, 95% CI = 0.81% to 3.19%) and rural location of residence (Î² = -19.4%, 95% CI = -35.7% to -89.4%). Correlates of willingness to pay in simple emergencies included rural location of residence (Î² = 59.4%, 95% CI = 37.9% to 133.7%) and higher educational levels (Î² = 7.96%, 95% CI = 1.96% to 11.8%). At all price levels, more individuals were willing to pay for transport for a life-threatening emergency than a disability-causing emergency. Respondents' willingness to pay was more responsive to price changes for transport during disability-causing emergencies than for transport during life-threatening emergencies. Conclusions: The primary correlates of willingness to pay for ambulance transport in Santiago AtitlÃ¡n, Guatemala, are household income, location of residence (rural district vs. urban district), and respondents' education levels. Furthermore, severity of emergency significantly appears to influence how much individuals are willing to pay for ambulance transport. Willingness-to-pay information may help public health planners in resource-poor settings develop price scales for health services and achieve economically efficient allocations of subsidies for referral ambulance transport.

Wildfire Detection From Multisensor Satellite Imagery Using Deep Semantic Segmentation,"Deriving the extent of areas affected by wildfires is critical to fire management, protection of the population, damage assessment, and better understanding of the consequences of fires. In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather.",NA,NA,10.1109/jstars.2021.3093625,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Current Status And Development Trend Of Uav Remote Sensing Applications In The Mining Industry,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is a state-of-the-art technology that integrates UAV, remote sensing sensor, GPS differential positioning, communication, and other technologies to achieve rapid collection, processing, and analysis of geographic environmental information. UAV remote sensing is considered an important supplement of spaceborne remote sensing and is recently being widely used in the topographical surveying and mapping, precision agriculture, heritage inspection, and emergency rescue, etc. For the traditional mining industry, high-quality and real-time UAV remote sensing data can be obtained at reasonable costs and benefit the mining operations, particularly for numerous small- and medium-scale mining sites where equipments and professional expertise are expensive. However, application scenarios of UAV remote sensing in the mining industry are rarely reported and lack systematic review. Therefore, the definition, platform composition, current status, and general workflow of UAV remote sensing technology were summarized in this study. Then, through significant domestic and foreign literature surveys, the application scenarios and practical case studies of UAV remote sensing in the mining industry were systematically presented. Finally, the development trend was analyzed on the basis of the shortcomings of current technology. Results show that (1) UAV remote sensing technology has the advantages of low costs, strong maneuverability, flexible data sampling settings, timeliness, repeatability, and high resolution. (2) The current applications of UAV remote sensing in the mining industry mainly include the operations management of open-pit mines, safety monitoring of tailing ponds, emergency rescue, environmental monitoring of mining areas, and prevention and control of slope disasters. (3) The development trend of UAV remote sensing technology application will include the standardization of UAV supervision, simplification of UAV control mode, augmentation of UAV endurance time, improvement of the quality of results, and further expansion of application scenarios. UAV remote sensing technology has broad application prospects in the mining industry and is bound to become an indispensable part of smart mines. Â© 2020, Science Press.

An Engineering Evaluation On The Glimpse Of Satellite Image Pre-Processing Utility Tools,"The advancement of technology in the area of satellite remote sensing has been generating voluminous amount of satellite images at regular intervals regularly. The satellite image analysis derive very useful, invaluable and essential inputs for various applications such as disaster management, civil aviation, meteorology, ocean observation systems, earth science studies and defense applications, etc. The satellite image analysis technique provides the necessary inputs for image preprocessing systems as a basic prerequisite and essential ingredient. Over the past several years many satellite image preprocessing tools have been developed with various features. The choice of satellite image preprocessing tools basically depend on the purpose of image analysis, the features of satellite image preprocessing tools and the specific need and application. Due to a large number of applications of satellite images, user has a wide ranging choice to select optimally the right preprocessing tool for the right application. Thus, the present study helps in aiding the proper understanding and selection of the various satellite image preprocessing tools and their features for any specific application. To facilitate this scheme, the current study has identified various satellite image preprocessing tools and prominent features of the desired tool.

A Comparative Study Of Built-Up Index Approaches For Automated Extraction Of Built-Up Regions From Remote Sensing Data,"Accurate built-up information is imperative for loss estimation and disaster management after the occurrence of catastrophic events such as earthquake, tornado, tsunami and flood. These catastrophic events leave behind a trail of mass destruction with property and human losses amounting to millions. Once a natural disaster hits a region, built-up information is required within a short span of time for disaster management. Nowadays, earth observation satellite imagery serves as a promising source to extract the land use / land cover classes. However, the automatic extraction of urban built-up from remote sensing data is a known challenge in the remote sensing community. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) algorithm has been recognized as an effective algorithm for automatic built-up identification from medium spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Few researchers have modified this algorithm and proposed new quantitative expressions for the built-up index. In this paper, three built-up index based, unsupervised built-up extraction algorithms have been reviewed and compared. An automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm is used to assort the built-up index values, obtained from modified built-up index algorithms, into built-up and non built-up regions for enhancing the efficiency of the built-up detection process. Qualitative assessment of these algorithms involves computation of several parameters including recently developed parameters like allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement, and classical parameters such as error of omission, error of commission and overall accuracy. This paper presents a case study where the algorithms have been implemented on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the city of Delhi and its surrounding areas for detection of built-up regions automatically.",NA,NA,10.1007/s12524-013-0333-9,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Implementing A Modern E-Learning Strategy In An Interdisciplinary Environment-Empowering Unesco Stakeholders To Use Earth Observation,"The Copernicus Program and the fleet of available Earth observation satellites provide valuable services in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, urban monitoring, and heritage management. However, drawbacks such as knowledge gaps by the user, limited technical and financial facilities or the lack of ready-to-use data, result in insufficient exploitation of these opportunities by heritage site managers and other relevant stakeholders. Based on an initial assessment of current threats, existing limitations and potential applications, we developed the e-learning module Space2Place. Through the use of the learning module, stakeholders get a substantial introduction into Earth observation and knowledge barriers that may exist are removed. For this purpose, we refined an existing e-learning platform, which was developed in close relation to an online remote sensing application and adapted to the needs of UNESCO site stakeholders. One of the main features is the personalization of the learning modules content depending on the abilities or interests of the user. The platform offers information with different levels of difficulty and adaptable learning paths. A graduation certificate and practical exercises in an online remote sensing application increase the specific added value for UNESCO site manager. By using the associated remote sensing application and its link to Space2Place, heritage site managers also improve their knowledge on image processing by working with original satellite imagery. Additional advantages of using the platform will be enhanced through the introduction of new learning modules, translation into other languages and accompanying scientific research.",NA,NA,10.3390/geosciences8120432,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Improving Maize Nitrogen Nutrition Index Prediction Using Leaf Fluorescence Sensor Combined With Environmental And Management Variables,"Precision nitrogen (N) management requires rapid and real-time technologies for in-season crop N status diagnosis. The leaf fluorescence sensor Dualex 4 is an effective and promising tool to monitor crop N status. N nutrition index (NNI) is the most widely recognized diagnostic tool for accurate in-season diagnosis of crop N status. However, studies focusing on revealing the relationships between fluorescence sensing indices and NNI and assessing the N status of maize is limited. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the potential of using Dualex 4 indices measured on three differently positioned leaves to estimate NNI across different stages; and (2) determine if the incorporation of environmental (weather) and management information can significantly improve the in-season N status prediction and diagnosis of maize. In 2016 and 2017, a total of four experiments with six N rates and three plant densities were conducted in two fields in Northeast China. Dualex sensor readings - Chlorophyll (Chl) and N balance index (NBI) - were collected from three differently positioned leaves at three growth stages. Some external factors including weather and management conditions were included for in-season N status assessment. The results indicated that the two Dualex indices (Chl and NBI) had strong relationships with NNI at different growth stages, and both stage-specific and across-stage models could estimate NNI based on their values acquired from differently positioned leaves. Nevertheless, the N diagnostic accuracies based on the estimated NNI by the Dualex indices were not satisfactory with Kappa values all lower than 0.40. Likewise, similar results were found in the multiple linear regression (MLR) models only based on the Dualex readings (MLRChl, MLRNBI and MLRChl+NBI). However, when weather and management variables were used together with Dualex sensor measurements in MLR analysis, the prediction of NNI (R2 = 0.81 to 0.85) and the accuracy of maize N status diagnosis (areal agreement = 0.79 and Kappa = 0.52 to 0.55) were significantly improved. More studies are needed to develop strategies combining more environmental and management variables with sensor data to further improve in-season N status diagnosis and N management and/or combine proximal with remote sensing for large-scale crop N nutritional status diagnosis and in-season site-specific N management.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108180,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Remote Sensing Of Crop Residue And Tillage Practices: Present Capabilities And Future Prospects,"Sustainable agricultural management is essential not only to maintain productivity of current farmlands, but also to conserve natural environments. Records of agricultural activities are required to assist rapid assessment of agricultural lands, and thus, designation of management plans and policies. By the 1980s, when unfavorable environmental impacts of conventional tillage practices were widely recognized, agronomists introduced conservation tillage to benefit soils and agricultural environments, and soon began programs to monitor adoption of conservation tillage practices. The role of remote sensing in acquiring this information has been increasing because remote sensing technologies can provide the broad scope and the ability to collect sequential imagery to estimate trends and patterns of adoption of alternative tillage practices. This review encompasses comparisons of remote sensing techniques with more conventional methods for surveying and estimating tillage status, applications of remote sensing technologies, data processing and analysis, validation and field data collection, impacts of terrain, spectral and spatial resolution, timing and temporal detail, and prospects of future instruments.

A Unified Multi-Purpose Calibration Site For Aerial And High Resolution Satellite Sensors,"Experience with both analog and digital systems show that laboratory calibration is not necessarily valid in airborne conditions; whereas the advantages of field calibration are that the entire imaging system is calibrated and not alone the optical part; and the parameters determined are valid in operational airborne conditions (Cramer 2004, 2006; Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetryâ, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b). The result of calibration and testing is dependent on a number of permanent system factors and systematic and random components associated with camera, imaging system, flight, atmosphere, object and data post-processing (Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetryâ, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b) those affect the quality of the raw images produced by the sensors. It is therefore important to calibrate the aerial or satellite imaging sensors in specially designed fields so that the performance of the entire chain is assessed taking into consideration all the influencing factors. In addition to imaging sensors, ISO 19159 for âCalibration and validation of remote sensing imagery sensors and dataâ also incorporates airborne laser scanners, imaging radar and water borne sonar systems (Kresse 2010). The task of developing uniform practices and standards for field calibration and testing has been taken up by several international working groups but hardly any permanent multipurpose test field like the one in SjÃ¶kulla, Finland with facilities for radiometric and spatial resolution calibration and networks of targeted benchmarks for geometric calibration at large, medium and small imaging scales is available.

Building Information Modelling (Bim) Capabilities In The Design And Planning Of Rural Settlements In China: A Systematic Review,"With rural revitalization being established as the national policy in China, the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural settlements has received widespread attention from the whole society in China. However, due to the over-exploitation of resources and the uneven development between urban and rural in China, the environmental conditions and residential experience in rural settlements in China are still relatively backward. To prompt the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural settlements in China, it is necessary to optimize the planning and design of rural settlements in China. As a multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can significantly contribute to the planning and design of rural settlements in China. To optimize the environmental quality and residential experience in rural settlements in China, this study is developed to perform a systematic literature review of the BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. To achieve this aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to perform this systematic review. The review and discussion of this study were conducted between June 2022 and September 2022. In this study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were adopted as the main databases, and 189 articles were reviewed. Through this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have significant advantages in the following aspects of the design and planning of rural settlements in China: Data storage and management; 3D modeling and visualization; Disaster prevention and environmental analysis; Cost estimation and optimization. Furthermore, through the discussion and analysis of research results, it can be concluded that BIM capabilities can perform their benefits in the rural settlements' design and planning through their following characteristics: knowledge management, simulation, and modeling. Based on the research results, it can be identified that knowledge management capabilities in BIM can effectively provide information support and knowledge assistance throughout the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. BIM's simulation and modeling capabilities can simulate and demonstrate the rural environment and their internal structures in rural settlements' design and planning phase to achieve their environmental optimization, residential comfort improvement, clash detection, disaster prevention, and expenditure reduction. Moreover, the challenge and future directions of BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China are discussed and analyzed.

A Sustainability-Based Socio-Technical-Environmental Project Selection Algorithm,"Including environmental and health impacts in project option selection is important to serve humanity and reduce the adverse effects of development. An algorithm is introduced here that includes lifecycle costs, avoided losses, usersâ willingness to pay and value per statistical life (VSL), and both environmental and health impacts. The algorithm is entitled the Socio-Technical-Environmental Project Selection (STEPS) algorithm and incorporates social and health aspects through the willingness to pay, technical aspects through the engineering design, and economic aspects through the lifecycle costs. The algorithm consists of estimating the various quantities needed, such as lifecycle costs, benefits (avoided mortality and infrastructure losses), willingness to pay, and the Environmental Protection Agencyâs Maximum Contaminant Level (EPA-MCL). These values are plotted with the environmental and health impacts on the horizontal axis and the Net Cost (equal to the lifecycle cost minus the benefits) on the vertical axis. The most balanced option is the one that plots closest to the origin of the plot. The new algorithm is demonstrated on project selection for the elimination of riverbank erosion using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as riprap. RCA uses previously used crushed concrete from demolition as aggregate for any beneficial purpose such as aggregate for new concrete or riprap, as in this case. The disadvantage of RCA, however, is that harmful chemicals leach out when exposed to water. Four options were considered, namely (1) do nothing, (2) use RCA as a riverbank erosion countermeasure, (3) use RCA with a leachate treatment system, and (4) use rock riprap instead of RCA. It was found that the proposed STEPS algorithm leads to the selection of Option 3 with RCA riprap and leachate treatment. Selecting by cost alone would have led to Option 2, which also happens to result in a violation of the EPA-MCL for the arsenic leachate. In addition, Option 4 would have been selected without considering RCA or the problem with landfills reaching capacity with the addition of crushed concrete. The STEPS algorithm, therefore, resulted in the most sustainable solution considering both the lifecycle cost and health and environmental impacts.

"Remote Sensing From SpaceâPresent And Future Applications In Forestry, Nature Conservation And Landscape Management","Past studies have suggested that sound knowledge about the reflectance characteristics of objects could be of great value in understanding the physical, chemical, and the spatial properties of features on our planet. These characteristics can be assessed remotely, and the available techniques hold considerable promise for the inventory and monitoring of natural resources. However, a significant lack of information concerning the full potential of this recent technology has resulted in an inadequate appreciation of the many possible applications in various domains. This paper presents the current situation regarding the development of satellite remote sensing technology within the fields of forestry, nature conservation, and landscape management in terms of resource assessment and monitoring. Future applications are reported on by having a closer look at the new generation of sensor systems and satellites, since methods currently used for environmental monitoring and resource survey appear to be fairly inappropriate or even inadequate in some cases. Forestry and associated environmental applications are reviewed in more detail with focus on projects being carried out in the southern part of Africa. Satellite remote sensing as a powerful and suitable tool for mapping purposes, forest mensuration and inventory, and forest disease and stress assessment is discussed. In addition, issues such as fire management, the assessment of soil erosion, the mapping of land cover, as well as wildlife habitat evaluation are raised. Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Calibration Of Satellite Measurements Of River Discharge Using A Global Hydrology Model,"Measurements of river discharge and watershed runoff are essential to water resources management, efficient hydropower generation, accurate flood prediction and control, and improved understanding of the global water cycle. Previous work demonstrates that orbital remote sensing can measure river discharge variation in a manner closely analogous to its measurement at ground stations, and using reach flow surface area instead of stage as the discharge estimator. For international measurements, hydrological modeling can, in principle, be used to provide the needed calibration of sensor data to discharge. The present study tests this approach and investigates the accuracy of the results. We analyze six sites within the US where gauging station, satellite measurements, and WBM model results are all available. Knowledge is thereby gained concerning how accurately satellite sensors can measure discharge, if the signal is calibrated only from global modeling results without any ground-based information. The calibration (rating) equations obtained for the remote sensing signal are similar, whether based on gauging station or on model information: r(2) correlation coefficients for least squares fits at one example site (\#524; White River, Indiana) are both .66 (n = 144, comparing monthly daily maxima, minima, and mean, 20032006). Space-based 4-day mean discharge values for this site when using the model calibration are accurate to within +/- 67\% on the average (n = 1824; largest percent errors occur at low discharges), and annual total runoff is accurate to 9\%, 2003-2008. Comparison of gauging station versus modeled discharge commonly indicates a small positive model bias; the observed errors of satellite-observed annual runoff are also positive and could be improved by bias removal from the rating curves. Also, analysis of a large flood event, along the Indus River in 2010, shows that the model does not capture flood wave attenuation by overbank flow, and thus predicts faster flood wave celerity and higher peak discharge than was measured by the remote sensing. The incorporation of overbank processes would improve discharge estimation via modeling, and also facilitate more accurate satellite-based measurement of peak discharge. The analysis shows that existing and planned microwave sensors can usefully characterize global river discharge dynamics, and that water balance model-based rating curves provide acceptable calibration of remote sensing signal to discharge.

Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Fuzzy- Pso Hybrid Approach,"Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always key features for classifying mixed pixels. This chapter proposes an approach for pixel classification using hybrid approach of Fuzzy C-Means and Particle Swarm Optimization methods. This new unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on fuzzy membership values. This approach addresses overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using fuzzy set membership values. PSO is a population-based stochastic optimization technique inspired from the social behavior of bird flocks. The authors demonstrate the algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of Shanghai.

Decommissioning Vs. Reusing Offshore Gas Platforms Within Ethical Decision-Making For Sustainable Development: Theoretical Framework With Application To The Adriatic Sea,"This paper integrates ethics into decision-making for sustainable development to help planners choose between decommissioning and reuse of an offshore gas platform within a social perspective. To do so, I match multi-criteria analysis (MCA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), weighted life-cycle assessment (WLCA), and monetary life-cycle assessment (MLCA) to four main ethical standpoints: MCA for duty to the current generation by minimising impacts (strong sustainability in a linear economy), WLCA for duty to the current and future generations by minimising impacts (strong sustainability in a circular economy), CBA for duty to the current generation by maximising welfare (weak sustainability in a linear economy), and MLCA for duty to the current and future generations by maximising welfare (weak sustainability in a circular economy). Analytical results demonstrated that reuse of the platforms is more suitable than decommissioning in a linear economy. Thus, the decision on decommissioning vs. reuse is primarily a matter of inter-generational equity. Numerical results with non-marginal assessments for a case study in the Adriatic Sea suggested that support for reuse of the platform is 100\% of the solution space based on MCA, 72\% based on WLCA, 89\% based on CBA, and 83\% based on MLCA. However, after accounting for the estimated impacts, WLCA no longer supports reuse. Thus, the decision on decommissioning vs. reuse depends secondarily on the sustainability perspective. Sensitivity analyses based on greater positive and negative perceptions of reuse and with greater social and environmental concerns showed that reuse is a robust choice with respect to perceptions (i.e., the information gap is not relevant) and concerns (i.e., stakeholder representativeness is not significant) for all sustainability paradigms and economic approaches. Therefore, the main policy implications are that the avoided decommissioning costs should be shared in terms of inter-generational distributive justice; and that employment and biodiversity benefits from reuse should be stressed within a strong sustainability perspective.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105409,"{""looks cool; where is ESI?""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"

All-Electric Satellites: Insurance Implications,"The significant mass reduction of an all-electric satellite compared to a chemically propelled satellite with the same payload, or the ability to include a larger payload for the same launch mass, will reduce transponder prices and ensure that satellite solutions remain competitive against terrestrial alternatives. The major disadvantage of all-electric satellites is the time it takes to reach geostationary orbit, which could be a number of months, even under nominal operations. Traditional space insurance policies include a provision such that a satellite can be declared a total loss if it does not reach geostationary orbit within a predefined number of days. For chemically propelled satellites that require a handful of impulsive burns to complete the transfer to GEO, such a loss is relatively easy to determine, and for a situation, for example, where a satellite is delivered short of its intended apogee, the quantum of a loss, or whether it is worth proceeding with the orbit-raising maneuvers, can be determined with confidence, relatively quickly. The situation for all-electric satellites will be different. For all-electric satellites it may be possible to overcome launch shortfalls or certain propulsion system failure scenarios by increasing the duration of the orbit-raising phase. Satellite insurance policies cover the value of the space asset, which for a newly launched satellite would usually mean the replacement cost of the satellite, the replacement cost of the launch service, and the cost of the insurancethe three main costs in any satellite project. Insurance does not usually cover the revenue that the satellite is expected to generate. While the traditional satellite insurance policies have served satellite operators well, there are failure scenarios for all-electric satellites, which only reduce the level of redundancy, for example, but which could result in a significant increase in the duration of orbit raising. The increased duration of orbit raising will result in a financial impact for the satellite operator due to the loss of revenue associated with the delayed entry into service, but would not be covered by a traditional satellite insurance policy. This article will consider, from an insurance perspective, the implications of moving to all-electric propulsion and suggest ways in which the satellite insurance coverage may need to be adapted to ensure satellite operators continue to be indemnified for the risks they face.",NA,NA,10.1089/space.2015.0007,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Priority Areas For Watershed Service Conservation In The Guapi-Macacu Region Of Rio De Janeiro, Atlantic Forest, Brazil","Introduction: Land use intensification and urbanisation processes are degrading hydrological ecosystem services in the Guapi-Macacu watershed of Rio de Janeiro. A proposal to pay farmers to restore natural watershed services might be an alternative to securing the water supply in the long-term for the around 2.5 million urban water users in the study region. This study quantifies the costs of changing current land use patterns to enhance watershed services and compares these costs to the avoided costs associated with water treatment for public supply.; Methods: We use farm-household data to estimate the opportunity costs of abandoning current land uses for the recovery of natural vegetation; a process that is very likely to improve water quality in terms of turbidity due to reduced inputs from erosion. Opportunity cost estimates are extrapolated to the watershed scale based on remote sensing land use classifications and vulnerability analysis to identify priority zones for watershed management interventions. To assess the potential demand for watershed services, we analyse water quality and treatment cost data from the main local water treatment plant.; Results: Changing agricultural land uses for watershed services provision generally comes at high opportunity costs in our study area near to the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. Alternative low cost watershed conservation options do exist in the livestock production sector. These options have the potential to directly reduce the amount of sediments and nutrients reaching the water bodies, and in turn decrease the costs of treatment needed for drinking water. Land cover changes at the scale needed to improve water quality will, nonetheless, likely exceed the cost of additional investments in water treatment.; Conclusions: The state water utility companyâs willingness to pay for watershed services alone will not be enough to induce provision of additional watershed services. We conclude that monetary incentives conditioned on specific adjustments to existing production systems could still have a complementary role to play in improving watershed services. However, we note that our willingness to pay analysis focusses on only one of the potentially wide range of ecosystem services provided by natural vegetation in the Guapi-Macacu watershed. Factoring these ecosystem services into the willingness to pay equation is likely to change our assessment in favour of additional conservation action, be it through PES or other policy instruments.

Assessment Of Satellite Health State Based On Fuzzy Variable Weight Theory,"Considering the health state assessment of in-orbit satellites in the field of spacecraft health mana-gement, a health state assessment method based on quantitative health degree calculated by fuzzy variable weight theory is proposed and applied to the assessment of the satellite attitude control system (ACS). First, on the component level, a health degree calculation method based on fuzzy dimensionless function and stable update process is presented. And then, on the system level, an improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with the variable weight synthesizing principle is used for establishing the analytic hierarchy model of ACS health state, and the assessment calculation is also given. Finally, the state analysis and assessment method is verified by means of fault simulation, and the results show that it has practical value for satellite health management.",NA,NA,10.3969/j.issn.1001-506x.2014.03.12,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Evapotranspiration Estimation And Validation At 16 M Resolution Based On Etmonitor Model Driven By Gf-1 Satellite Remote Sensing Datasets,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the core variables for studying the surface water cycle and management of the field-scale water resources. Satellite remote sensing are widely adopted to obtain the variation of evapotranspiration at large spatial scale, but the resolution of existing ET products is mainly limited at low or medium resolution (1â25 km), which cannot satisfy the field-scale water management application. The Chinese GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV) camera has the characteristics of high spatial and temporal resolution, with a spatial resolution of 16m, and it can support to generate ET products with high spatial and temporal resolution, which has not yet been well presented. The objective of this study is to present the capacity of using the remote sensing data from the GF-1 satellite as the driving force to produce high resolution (16 m) ET. The ETMonitor model was adopted to estimate ET at 16 m resolution in this study. ETMonitor is a combined model with multi-process parameterizations, and it has been proven to be able to generate accurate regional and global ET estimation at relative coarse resolution (e.g., 1 km) mainly using the biophysical and hydrological parameters/variables retrieved from satellite observations. During the ET estimation procedure, the adopted GF-1 remote sensing datasets include the Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC), Albedo, and NDVI datasets, which are retrieved from previous studies. Ground observation data from 16 sites in China was collected to validate the estimated ET, including 6 grassland sites, 4 cropland sites, 1 mixed forest site, 2 shrubland sites, and 3 desert or Gobi sites. The validation results show that the overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of estimated daily evapotranspiration based on GF-1 satellite remote sensing datasets is 0.85 mm d-1, the correlation coefficient (R) is 0.79, and the Bias is 0.16 mm d-1, which can demonstrate the high accuracy of estimated ET. The GF-1 based ET at 16 m resolution also presented better performance in terms of spatial variation of ET comparing with the low-resolution (e. g., 1 km) ET, especially in the regions with high surface heterogeneity. These highlight the ability of Chinese GF-1 satellite remote sensing dataset could produce accurate ET at high spatial variation, and it has potential to meet the application of field-scale agricultural water resources management, irrigation management, ecological environment monitoring and government decision-making in China. However, due to the impact of the revisit cycle of the GF-1 satellite and the impact of clouds, there are some gaps or missing values in GF-1 based LAI, FVC or Albedo, and these further cause gaps in the GF-1 ET data. In order to improve the availability of high-resolution ET products, it is necessary to produce spatially and temporally continuous high-resolution ET products, which will be the focus of follow-up research.

Dammed Lake Water Volume Estimation By Satellite Imagery And Digital Elevation Model Under Unknown Underwater Terrain Scenario,"The real-time dynamic monitoring of water volume has great value for risk assessment, prediction, and early warning and disposal decision-making of dammed lakes. In view of the difficulty in obtaining underwater topographic data of dammed lake in areas without gauged data on the plateau, directly, quantitatively, and timely estimating the water volume of dammed lake by using remote sensing technology is difficult. This study aims to solve the problem of rapid quantitative estimation of water volume of plateau dammed lake under unknown underwater terrain scenario by remote sensing and perform the risk monitoring and disaster assessment of dammed lake.According to the existing remote sensing data and digital elevation information, this study puts forward a remote sensing quantitative estimation method of water volume of dammed lake on the plateau without underwater terrain by fully using remote sensing data. The details are as follows. First, the submerged area of dammed lake is extracted from remote sensing images. Second, the center line of the complex polygon of the dammed lake is calculated. Specifically, according to the water area of the dammed lake, the Tyson polygon algorithm is used to calculate the position information of the dammed lake centerline. Third, through the location of the polygonal center line of the dammed lake, the fixed-point elevation measurement is carried out to complete the fitting calculation. Then, according to the fitting estimation of the middle line elevation and combined with the slope elevation information, the unknown underwater terrain of the dammed lake is adaptively simulated. Finally, based on the simulated underwater terrain and the submerged area of the dammed lake, the capacity of the dammed lake is calculated by 3D curved surface space discrete integration.The dammed lake, namely, Sarez Lake in the Pamirs was selected as the research area. Remote sensing survey and empirical research on water volume were carried out using the proposed method. The research results show that the water area of Sarez dammed lake is approximately 89.09 km2, and the water volume of Sarez Lake is approximately 16.25 billion m3. This result is consistent with the expert's estimated water volume of 15.5 billion m3 to 16.5 billion m3. The accuracy verification of the local simulation experiment shows that the overall dynamic error between the simulation data and the measured data is controlled within 10%, and the correlation coefficient is 0.95 (P<0.01, double tailed). This finding further proves the robustness of the algorithm and the credibility of the estimation results.This method can rapidly estimate the water volume of plateau dammed lake, with high accuracy and strong technical universality. It provides an efficient method for remote sensing estimation of plateau dammed lake water volume under none or lack of underwater terrain data scenario. It also solves the problem of quantitative calculation of plateau dammed lake water volume with unknown underwater terrain. Â© 2022, Science Press.

Precision Agriculture And The Role Of Remote Sensing: A Review,"Precision agriculture involves the integration of new technologies including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies to allow farm producers to manage within field variability to maximize the cost-benefit ratio, rather than using the traditional whole-field approach. Variable Rate Technology (VRT) available with farm implements, such as fertilizer or pesticide applicators and yield monitors, have evolved rapidly and have fostered the growth of precision agriculture. Site specific management allows inputs to be reduced, while optimizing outputs, both of which are attractive to the farm producer. At the same time, by reducing inputs, the run-off of fertilizers and pesticides is reduced, thus improving the environmental condition of the agro-ecosystem. Remote sensing provides input data for many precision agriculture applications including pre-growth soil fertility and moisture analyses, crop growth and growth detractant monitoring (crop scouting), and yield forecasting. This information in turn helps the farm producer in his decision-making. Although the acceptance and growth of precision agriculture has been rapid, some fundamental requirements are needed to help fully develop and implement this technology. Among these requirements are continued research and development of algorithms for the radiometric and geometric correction of remote sensing data and for information extraction. Also, access to timely, cost-effective remote sensing data, or derived value-added products and the development of decision support systems or other expert systems integrating GIS, GPS, and RS technologies in a user-friendly fashion are needed. A subsequent training and technology transfer program to accelerate the acceptance and implementation of this technology for the agri-business sector is also a necessity.

Unmanned Aircraft Systems For Precision Weed Detection And Management: Prospects And Challenges,"Modern precision weed management relies on site-specific management tactics to maximize resource use efficiency and yield, while reducing unintended environmental impacts caused by herbicides. Scouting for weeds is an important activity to assist weed management decision making, and has been carried out by trained specialists through extensive and routine visual examination of the fields. Recent advancements in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)-based tools and geospatial information technology have created enormous applications for efficient and economical assessment of weed infestations as well as site-specific weed management. The utilization of UAS-based technologies for weed management applications is currently in its infancy, but this field has witnessed rapid growth in recent times in terms of aerial data acquisition and analysis. Challenges exist in UAS platform reliability, sensor capability and integration, image pre-processing, quantitative assessment and prediction, final product development, and product delivery.

Improvement Of Multi-Satellite Real-Time Precipitation Products For Ensemble Streamflow Simulation In A Middle Latitude Basin In South China,"The real-time availability of several satellite-based precipitation products has recently provided hydrologists with an unprecedented opportunity to improve current hydrologic prediction capability for vast river basins, particularly for ungauged regions. However, the accuracy of real-time satellite precipitation data remains uncertain. This study aims to use three widely used real-time satellite precipitation products, namely, TRMM Multi satellite Precipitation Analysis real-time precipitation product 3B42 (TMPA 3B42RT), Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensing Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIAN), and NOAA/Climate Precipitation Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), for ensemble stream flow simulation with the gridded xinanjiang (XAJ) model and shuffled complex evolution metropolis (SCEM-UA) algorithm in the middle-latitude Mishui basin in South China. To account the bias of the satellite precipitation data and consider the input uncertainty, two different methods, i.e. a precipitation error multiplier and a precipitation error model were introduced. For each precipitation input model, the posterior probability distribution of the parameters and their associated uncertainty were calibrated using the SCEM-UA algorithm, and 15,000 ensemble stream flow simulations were conducted. The simulations of the satellite precipitation data were then optimally merged using the Bayseian model averaging (BMA) method. The result shows that in Mishui basin, the three sets of real-time satellite precipitation data largely underestimated rainfall. Streamflow simulation performed poorly when the raw satellite precipitation data were taken as input and the model parameters were calibrated with gauged data. By implementing the precipitation error multiplier and the precipitation error model and then recalibrating the model, the behavior of the simulated stream flow and calculated uncertainty boundary were significantly improved. Furthermore, the BMA combination of the simulations from the three datasets resulted in a significantly better prediction with a remarkably reliable uncertainty boundary and was comparable with the simulation using the post-real-time bias-corrected research quality TMPA 3B42V7. The proposed methodology of bias adjustment, uncertainty analysis, and BMA combination collectively facilitates the application of the current three real-time satellite data to hydrological prediction and water resource management over many under-gauged basins. This research is also an investigation on the hydrological utility of multi-satellite precipitation data ensembles, which can potentially integrate additional more satellite products when the Global Precipitation Measuring mission with 9-satellite constellation is anticipated in 2014.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11269-014-0612-4,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

On The Potential Of Surfers To Monitor Environmental Indicators In The Coastal Zone,"The social and economic benefits of the coastal zone make it one of the most treasured environments on our planet. Yet it is vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Coastal management aims to mitigate these pressures while augmenting the socio-economic benefits the coastal region has to offer. However, coastal management is challenged by inadequate sampling of key environmental indicators, partly due to issues relating to cost of data collection. Here, we investigate the use of recreational surfers as platforms to improve sampling coverage of environmental indicators in the coastal zone. We equipped a recreational surfer, based in the south west United Kingdom (UK), with a temperature sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) device that they used when surfing for a period of one year (85 surfing sessions). The temperature sensor was used to derive estimates of sea-surface temperature (SST), an important environmental indicator, and the GPS device used to provide sample location and to extract information on surfer performance. SST data acquired by the surfer were compared with data from an oceanographic station in the south west UK and with satellite observations. Our results demonstrate: (i) high-quality SST data can be acquired by surfers using low cost sensors; and (ii) GPS data can provide information on surfing performance that may help motivate data collection by surfers. Using recent estimates of the UK surfing population, and frequency of surfer participation, we speculate around 40 million measurements on environmental indicators per year could be acquired at the UK coastline by surfers. This quantity of data is likely to enhance coastal monitoring and aid UK coastal management. Considering surfing is a world-wide sport, our results have global implications and the approach could be expanded to other popular marine recreational activities for coastal monitoring of environmental indicators.",NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0127706,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Opportunities For Improving Conservation Early Warning And Alert Systems,"Conservation early warning and alert systems (CEAS) provide tremendous opportunities to inform strategic and effective environmental responses. However, these systems are not systematically evaluated based on how they are contributing to conservation outcomes. We survey the current state of systems enabled by satellite monitoring to support tropical forest management and highlight their recent proliferation and the sparse evaluations of these systems in terms of user adoption and application for improving conservation decisions. To guide practitioners, funders and policymakers to choose the appropriate tool for the application, we distinguish two types of CEAS, Rapid Response and Targeted Response, characterized by the user application and the timeframe for decision-making. These tools are distinct from monitoring tools used for policy and planning which require routine, high-accuracy and quantifiable estimates of land cover change. We see a need for more systematic evaluations quantifying their environmental and socioeconomic benefits and improved indicators measuring progress toward achieving conservation outcomes. To inform system developers, we summarize best practices for increasing system adoption and use gleaned from seasoned applications of early warning and alert systems for conservation and humanitarian applications. Engaging diverse stakeholders, building permanent capacity, increasing accessibility and interpretability of the information, and communicating the information value to decision-makers help root these systems into decision-making processes. Incorporating local knowledge and on-the-ground monitoring information from stakeholders can improve alert accuracy while respectfully honoring local knowledge and garnering stakeholder trust in the systems. Strengthening cross-institutional networks, building political support, and allocating adequate resources empower decision-makers to act upon the information.

Evaluation Of Negative Economic-Environmental Externalities Of Overextraction Of Groundwater,"In recent decades, increased extraction of groundwater for human and agriculture consumption has led to a substantial drop in groundwater level in large areas of across the world. Declining groundwater levels is a serious problem in itself and has multiple economic, social, cultural, political, security-related, and environmental externalities. The negative economic-environmental externalities of overextraction of groundwater in the Orzouiyeh plain in the Kerman Province, Iran, were evaluated using methods such as replacement cost, production function, market prices, shadow price, and the value of the input marginal product. After evaluating externalities, the Positive Mathematical Programming method was used to evaluate different water policies to reduce the consumption of groundwater. The total economic losses due to the externalities were calculated to equal 2.8 U.S. million dollars. The damages caused by environmental externalities were calculated to equal 436.1 U.S. million dollars.

Status And Prospect Of Agricultural Remote Sensing,"Remote sensing technology can cost-effectively access a wide range of real-time land surface spatial information, and provides an effective way for resource surveys, environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. With the help of remote sensing technology, geo-information can be acquired quickly, accurately, efficiently and comprehensively. Undoubtedly, remote sensing will play an increasingly important role in the fields of geosciences, agricultural sciences, and so on. In particular civil resources satellite was launched in the 1970s, which was applied in agriculture and benefited first. Moreover, significant developments were registered in some key fields along with the advancement of high resolution remote sensing. The combination of their high temporal frequency with extended geographical coverage makes them particularly useful for time series crop growth monitoring, crop types subdivision, and acquisition of field precision agriculture. The fact is of note that the new challenges followed as a result of the dispersion and spatial-temporal variability in agricultural production. An overview of the history and theoretical background of agricultural remote sensing technology was introduced. And then four aspects of yield estimation, agricultural resources survey, agricultural disaster monitoring and precision agriculture management were presented. Remotely sensed data from existing platforms and the ground observation network technology which can provide an important data source for supporting agriculture were expected. On the other hand, new generation remote sensing platform of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) should be promoted. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore multi-sensors, spectral data, surface characteristic parameters and existing crop model.

The availability and utility of four datasets; Canada Land Inventory for Ungulates, Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests, Provincial Forest Inventory for the Island of Newfoundland, and the Landsat 7 ETM+ were evaluated for their usefulness in delineating land cover boundaries in areas used by caribou during calving and post-calving.

Multi-Level Health Evaluation Method For On-Orbit Satellites Based On Reconfigurable Degree,"At present, the main methods for evaluating the multi-level health status of on-orbit satellites are the weighted synthesis methods. However, these methods cannot adequately characterize the high redundancy and reconfigurability of the satellite system, and the weight parameters are seriously determined by subjective judgment or expert experience.

At the component level, the non-parametric regression method is used to evaluate the health status. From the component level to the system level, the system can be evaluated by building a tree structure model based on the degree of reconfiguration.

The case study presented is the City of Tshwane, South Africa, a Global South city facing rapid urbanization. We found that this method of mapping green infrastructure benefits can provide simultaneous oversight on multiple objectives for green infrastructure, including climate change adaptation, biodiversity, and equitable distribution of urban green space. We found that low-scoring benefit areas occur in dense urban areas where small-scale nature-based solutions or rehabilitation activities are required. Moderate benefit scores occurred in parts of the city that are vulnerable to urban expansion and densification activities, warranting the careful planning of green infrastructure provision, and that moderate-to-high-scoring areas can be protected as conservation areas.

Self-Supervised Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based On High Frequency Feature And Gate Attention-Guided Optimization Unit,"Remote sensing image change detection (CD) is a technical method to analyze and compare remote sensing images covering the same area with different phases to determine the process of surface change, which has important application value in natural resource management, land monitoring, and natural disaster monitoring. At present, the commonly used supervised remote sensing image CD technique requires a large number of labeled samples to train the network, which brings a large human and material cost. In contrast, the unsupervised remote sensing image CD technique does not require the construction of labeled samples; however, there is no direct correspondence between the unsupervised learning task and the downstream CD. To address the aforementioned issues, a self-supervised remote sensing image CD method based on a high frequency feature enhancement module (HFFEM) and gate attention-guided optimization unit (GAGOU) Siamese-like network is proposed. First, the network is trained using a self-supervised learning diagram to extract features that are beneficial to remote sensing image CD and better serve the downstream CD task. After that, a clustering loss function and a contrastive loss function are used to optimize the network. Second, to enhance the feature extraction capability for change edges and to address the degradation of network performance due to the entrainment of redundant features during feature fusion, HFFEM and GAGOU are proposed, respectively. Finally, comprehensive simulation experiments were conducted on the IKONOS multi-spectral datasets Mina and Riyadh, the open CD dataset Onera satellite change detection (OSCD), and the heterogeneous dataset Shuguang, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms based on evaluation metrics, such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and F1 score.",NA,NA,10.1117/1.jrs.17.024518,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"

Credible Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Evidential Fusion On Aerial-Ground Dual-View Images,"Due to their ability to offer more comprehensive information than data from a single view, multi-view (e.g., multi-source, multi-modal, multi-perspective) data are being used more frequently in remote sensing tasks. However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality is becoming more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN)-based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexibly in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible. On two well-known, publicly available datasets of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing images, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

A 6-Year-Long (2013-2018) High-Resolution Air Quality Reanalysis Dataset In China Based On The Assimilation Of Surface Observations From Cnemc,"A 6-year-long high-resolution Chinese air quality reanalysis (CAQRA) dataset is presented in this study obtained from the assimilation of surface observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS).This dataset contains surface fields of six conventional air pollutants in China (i.e. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) for the period 2013-2018 at high spatial (15km +/- 15km) and temporal (1 h) resolutions. This paper aims to document this dataset by providing detailed descriptions of the assimilation system and the first validation results for the above reanalysis dataset. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is adopted to demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis. The CV results show that the CAQRA yields an excellent performance in reproducing the magnitude and variability of surface air pollutants in China from 2013 to 2018 (CV R 2 D 0 :52-0.81, CV root mean square error (RMSE) D 0 :54 mg =m3 for CO, and CV RMSE D 16 :4-39.3 mu g =m(3) for the other pollutants on an hourly scale). Through comparison to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), we show that CAQRA attains a high accuracy in representing surface gaseous air pollutants in China due to the assimilation of surface observations. The fine horizontal resolution of CAQRA also makes it more suitable for air quality studies on a regional scale. The PM2.5 reanalysis dataset is further validated against the independent datasets from the US Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program over China, which exhibits a good agreement with the independent observations (R 2 D 0 :74-0.86 and RMSE D 16 :8-33.6 mu g =m3 in different cities). Furthermore, through the comparison to satellite-estimated PM2.5 concentrations, we show that the accuracy of the PM2.5 reanalysis is higher than that of most satellite estimates. The CAQRA is the first high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China that simultaneously provides the surface concentrations of six conventional air pollutants, which is of great value for many studies, such as health impact assessment of air pollution, investigation of air quality changes in China, model evaluation and satellite calibration, optimization of monitoring sites, and provision of training data for statistical or artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting.

Model-Driven Coordinated Management Of Data Centers,"Management of computing infrastructure in data centers is an important and challenging problem, that needs to: (i) ensure availability of services conforming to the Service Level Agreements (SLAs); and (ii) reduce the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), i.e. the ratio of total power, up to half of which is attributed to data center cooling, over the computing power to service the workloads. The cooling energy consumption can be reduced by allowing higher-than-usual thermostat set temperatures while maintaining the ambient temperature in the data center room within manufacturer-specified server redline temperatures for their reliable operations. This paper proposes: (i) a Coordinated Job, Power, and Cooling Management (JPCM) policy, which performs: (a) job management so as to allow for an increase in the thermostat setting of the cooling unit while meeting the SLA requirements, (b) power management to reduce the produced thermal load, and (c) cooling management to dynamically adjust the thermostat setting; and (ii) a Model-driven coordinated Management Architecture (MMA), which uses a state-based model to dynamically decide the correct management policy to handle events, such as new workload arrival or failure of a cooling unit, that can trigger an increase in the ambient temperature. Each event is associated with a time window, referred to as the window-of-opportunity, after which the temperature at the inlet of one or more servers can go beyond the redline temperature if proper management policies are not enforced. This window-of-opportunity monotonically decreases with increase in the incoming workload. The selection of the management policy depends on their potential energy benefits and the conformance of the delays in their actuation to the window-of-opportunity. Simulations based on actual job traces from the ASU HPC data center show that the JPCM can achieve up to 18% energy-savings over separated power or job management policies. However, high delay to reach a stable ambient temperature (in case of cooling management through dynamic thermostat setting) can violate the server redline temperatures. A management decision chart is developed as part of MMA to autonomically employ the management policy with maximum energy-savings without violating the window-of-opportunity, and hence the redline temperatures. Further, a prototype of the JPCM is developed by configuring the widely used Moab cluster manager to dynamically change the server priorities for job assignment. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Remote Sensing Image Compression Assessment Based On Multilevel Distortions,"The measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance to remote sensing image compression, especially for image quality assessment and compression algorithm optimization. We exploit the distortion features of optical remote sensing image compression and propose a full-reference image quality metric based on multilevel distortions (MLD), which assesses image quality by calculating distortions of three levels (such as pixel-level, contexture-level, and content-level) between original images and compressed images. Based on this, a multiscale MLD (MMLD) algorithm is designed and it outperforms the other current methods in our testing. In order to validate the performance of our algorithm, a special remote sensing image compression distortion (RICD) database is constructed, involving 250 remote sensing images compressed with different algorithms and various distortions. Experimental results on RICD and Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering databases show that the proposed MMLD algorithm has better consistency with subjective perception values than current state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image compression assessment, and the objective assessment results can show the distortion features and visual quality of compressed image well. It is suitable to be the evaluation criteria for optical remote sensing image compression.

Applicability Of Satellite-Based Rainfall Algorithms For Estimating Flood-Related Rainfall Events In The Mid-Latitudes. Part I: Spatial Integration,"This paper presents a study of the applicability of four satellite-based rainfall algorithms using highly resolved data from the first Meteosat Second-Generation satellite to derive hourly rain intensities. Saxony serves as an example of the mid-latitude regions. The focus is on the suitability of these algorithms to detect and to monitor (flash) flood-related rain intensities. For this purpose, 9 days with high rainfall amounts between May and August 2006 were analysed by comparing the satellite rain intensities to gauge adjusted radar data. Five different spatial resolutions were used to examine the effects of spatial integration from small scale (18km 2) to large scale (57600km 2) on (i) the quality of the satellite rain intensities (amounts and locations); (ii) the related loss of spatial information; and (iii) possible applications for flood risk management. The results show that spatial integration leads to improvements of rain intensities and evaluation scores; however, it also leads to decreased applicability for estimating high-intensity rainfall events that affect small- and medium-scale basins.

Willingness To Pay For Clean Air In China,"We use a residential sorting model incorporating migration disutility to recover the implicit value of clean air in China. The model is estimated using China Population Census Data along with PM2.5 satellite data. Our study provides new evidence on the willingness to pay for air quality improvements in developing countries and is the first application of an equilibrium sorting model to the valuation of non-market amenities in China. We employ two instrumental variables based on coal-fired electricity generation and wind direction to address the endogeneity of local air pollution. Results suggest important differences between the residential sorting model and a conventional hedonic model, highlighting the role of moving costs and the discreteness of the choice set. Our sorting results indicate that the economic value of air quality improvement associated with a one-unit decline in PM2.5 concentration is up to \$8.83 billion for all Chinese households in 2005.

Hsi Modeling And Intelligent Optimization For Fishing Ground Forecasts Using A Genetic Algorithm,"The construction of a habitat suitability index (HSI) model is a crucial problem in fishing ground forecasts. In general, the HSI model is established by estimating the relationship between marine environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities. However, the environmental factors observed by remote sensing technology and commercial fishing investigations are usually highly correlated, and conventional methods such as the continued product model, minimum model, maximum model, arithmetic mean model, and geometric mean model cannot eliminate the harmful effects caused by the correlation of fishing data. As a result, it is difficult for them to capture the complex relations between environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities. Based on the widely used intelligent optimization method of genetic algorithms (GAs), this paper presents a general framework called GeneHSI for HSI modeling and intelligent optimization. Most importantly, the GeneHSI framework can remove the harmful effects of correlation, allowing the automatic retrieval and optimization of the HSI parameters. The core of GeneHSI modeling is the construction of a fitness function. This function was built by projecting the logistic regression-based HSI space to that of a GA, and is used to guide the optimization process of GeneHSI. Specifically, the fundamental concept of the projection is to minimize accumulative errors between the computed ground probabilities and the observed probabilities converted from commercial fishing data. The proposed GeneHSI framework is composed of three elements. These are the construction of the problem to be solved, the initialization of the GA, and the optimization strategy of the GA. The validation and effectiveness of the GeneHSI framework have been demonstrated using simulation data, that is, randomly generated normalized marine environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities range from 0 to 1. Research shows that the GeneHSI framework is effective and efficient in retrieving and optimizing HSI parameters for fishing ground forecasts. Because of the stochastic characteristics of GAs, however, there is a high requirement for modelers and scientists to better control the implementation of the GeneHSI framework. The HSI parameters retrieved by the GeneHSI framework vary under different constraints. Such constraints used in GAs commonly include linear inequalities and linear equality constraints on the underlying relations between marine environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities, as well as constraints on the bounds of HSI parameters. Compared with the results under optimization strategies using these constraints, the results under a general optimization strategy are inferior in that the GeneHSI framework cannot obtain a good match between the best-fitness and mean-fitness curves. In theory, the fitness value is the accumulative error of the GeneHSI model; hence, a smaller value indicates a better result. However, a good convergence process does not necessarily lead to a minimum fitness value amongst fitness functions under different constraints. In this paper, therefore, an evaluation of the convergence process, instead of a minimum fitness value, is considered the fundamental standard for the assessment of a good set of HSI parameters. In addition, experience and professional knowledge are required for an exact assessment of the HSI parameters. Overall, the above constraints, especially those on the parameter bounds, greatly help the optimization of the GeneHSI framework to retrieve better HSI parameters. In addition, the implementation of the GeneHSI framework with 100, 1 000, 5 000, and 10 000 samples demonstrates its strong capability for processing the mass data of fishing grounds. It is expected that the GeneHSI framework can enrich the modeling methods and theories of fishing grounds, and hence guide the application of intelligent optimization methods in fishing ground HSI modeling.

Environmental Applications Of Remote Sensing,"Remote sensing, the science and technology through which characteristics and properties of targets on Earth can be identified and determined from a distance, has provided systematic, dedicated, and repetitive observations of the Earthâs surface (atmosphere, water, land, living species, vegetation, pollution, climate) from global to local scales. Satellite observations have contributed to the spectacular improvement of the accuracy of weather forecasts over the last few decades. Remote sensing has provided the means for detecting and quantifying the rates of pollution, and mapping and monitoring sources of pollution and the degree of remediation for their management. It has the means to respond and facilitate environmental management, and makes sound and evidence-based decisions in relation to Earthâs resources at a global scale and across different continents, nations, and domains. Remote sensing currently supplies essential Earth observations to protect irreplaceable resources and provide support for sustainable economic growth, disaster resilience, management of energy and mineral resources, food and water security, and sustainability. It provides powerful tools for understanding the past and present conditions of Earth systems and components, as well as the interplay between them. Thus remote sensing could assist us to solve environmental problems, address and mitigate risks, and deliver skillful predictions of the future behaviors of Earth systems (natural disasters, state of oceans, atmosphere, land, vegetation, food, public health, etc.). And by translating these Earth observations into decision making, remote sensing could help mobilize actions to mitigate effects to the benefit of human race. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Integration Of Farm Financial Accounting And Farm Management Information Systems For Better Sustainability Reporting,"Farmers face an increasing administrative burden as agricultural policies and certification systems of trade partners ask for more sustainability reporting. Several indicator frameworks have been developed to measure sustainability, but they often lack empirical operationalization and are not always measured at the farm level. The research gap we address in this paper is the empirical link between the data needs for sustainability reporting and the developments in data management at the farm level. Family farms do not collect much data for internal management, but external demand for sustainability data can partly be fulfilled by reorganizing data management in the farm office. The Farm Financial Accounts (FFAs) and Farm Management Information Systems (FMISs) are the main data sources in the farm office. They originate from the same source of note-taking by farmers but became separated when formalized and computerized. Nearly all European farms have a bank account and must keep financial accounts (e.g., for Value-Added Tax or income tax) that can be audited. Financial accounts are not designed for environmental accounting or calculating sustainability metrics but provide a wealth of information to make assessments on these subjects. FMISs are much less frequently used but collect more technical and fine-grained data at crop or enterprise level for different fields. FMISs are also strong in integrating sensor and satellite data. Integrating data availability and workflows of FFAs and FMISs makes sustainability reporting less cumbersome regarding data entry and adds valuable data to environmental accounts. This paper applies a design science approach to design an artifact, a dashboard for sustainability reporting based on the integration of information flows from farm financial accounting systems and farm management information systems. The design developed in this paper illustrates that if invoices were digitized, most data-gathering needed for external sustainability reporting would automatically be done when the invoices is paid by a bank transfer. Data on the use of inputs and production could be added with procedures as in current FMISs, but with less data entry, fewer risks of differences in outcomes, and possibilities of cross-checking the results.",NA,NA,10.3390/electronics12061485,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Evaluating Landscape Options For Corridor Restoration Between Giant Panda Reserves,"The establishment of corridors can offset the negative effects of habitat fragmentation by connecting isolated habitat patches. However, the practical value of corridor planning is minimal if corridor identification is not based on reliable quantitative information about species-environment relationships. An example of this need for quantitative information is planning for giant panda conservation. Although the species has been the focus of intense conservation efforts for decades, most corridor projects remain hypothetical due to the lack of reliable quantitative researches at an appropriate spatial scale. In this paper, we evaluated a framework for giant panda forest corridor planning. We linked our field survey data with satellite imagery, and conducted species occupancy modelling to examine the habitat use of giant panda within the potential corridor area. We then conducted least-cost and circuit models to identify potential paths of dispersal across the landscape, and compared the predicted cost under current conditions and alternative conservation management options considered during corridor planning. We found that due to giant panda's association with areas of low elevation and flat terrain, human infrastructures in the same area have resulted in corridor fragmentation. We then identified areas with high potential to function as movement corridors, and our analysis of alternative conservation scenarios showed that both forest/bamboo restoration and automobile tunnel construction would significantly improve the effectiveness of corridor, while residence relocation would not significantly improve corridor effectiveness in comparison with the current condition. The framework has general value in any conservation activities that anticipate improving habitat connectivity in human modified landscapes. Specifically, our study suggested that, in this landscape, automobile tunnels are the best means to remove current barriers to giant panda movements caused by anthropogenic interferences.",NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0105086,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Incorporating Ecological And Evolutionary Processes Into Continental-Scale Conservation Planning,"Systematic conservation planning research has focused on designing systems of conservation areas that efficiently protect a comprehensive and representative set of species and habitats. Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: ( 1) using sub-catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a sub-catchment scale; ( 2) targeting one type of ecological refugia, drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species during widespread drought; ( 3) targeting one type of evolutionary refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota during long-term climatic changes; and ( 4) preferentially grouping priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining processes. We identified drought refugia, areas of relatively high and regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with a more traditional framework of efficiently representing a comprehensive sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia. We explored the trade-offs between economic costs, representation targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and were identified for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas for conservation investment are more likely to have long-term benefits to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered in their identification.",NA,NA,10.1890/07-1684.1,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

Improving The Optimization Solution For A Semi-Analytical Shallow Water Inversion Model In The Presence Of Spectrally Correlated Noise,"In coastal regions, shallow water semi-analytical inversion algorithms may be used to derive geophysical parameters such as inherent optical properties (IOPs), water column depth, and bottom albedo coefficients by inverting sensor-derived sub-surface remote sensing reflectance, r(rs). The uncertainties of these derived geophysical parameters due to instrumental and environmental noise can be estimated numerically via the addition of spectral noise to the sensor-derived r(rs) before inversion. Repeating this process multiple times allows the calculation of the standard error and average for each derived parameter. Apart from spectral non-uniqueness, the optimization algorithm employed in the inversion must converge onto a single minimum to obtain a true representation of the uncertainty for a given set of noise-perturbed r(rs). Failure to do so inflates the uncertainty and affects the average retrieved value (accuracy). We show that the standard approach of seeding the optimization with an arbitrary, fixed initial guess, can lead to the convergence to multiple minima, each having substantially different centroids in multi-parameter solution space. We present the Update-Repeat Levenberg-Marquardt (UR-LM) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) routines that dynamically search the solution space for an optimal initial guess, that when applied to the optimization allows convergence to the best local minimum. We apply the UR-LM and LHS methods on HICO-derived and simulated r(rs) and demonstrate the improved computational efficiency, precision, and accuracy afforded from these methods compared with the standard approach. Conceptually, these methods are applicable to remote sensing based, shallow water or oceanic semi-analytical inversion algorithms requiring nonlinear least squares optimization.",NA,NA,10.4319/lom.2014.12.651,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Cost And Benefit Of Satellite Shielding,"Recent simulations of the future development of the space debris environment revealed that the number of hypervelocity impacts on satellite surfaces will increase. Impacts of space debris particles and micrometeoroids can damage satellites. This can cause operational anomalies or even the loss of a satellite mission. The loss of a satellite reduces its expected operational lifetime. Thus, financial investments cannot be amortized completely. In this paper the cost of hypervelocity impacts on satellites is estimated. A risk analysis is performed by combining the probability of a penetration with the failure probability of the satellite. The goal of this work is to combine the risk of particle impacts with a cost analysis. The probability of a satellite failure is estimated by combining the probability of a penetration with a vulnerability model. The failure probability is weighted with the mission cost of a satellite. This results in a probability of loss of amortization. The amortization loss is used as estimation for the damage cost due to hypervelocity impacts. In this way it is possible to associate impacts with cost. The cost model is used to analyze selected reference missions. This analysis considers the influence of shielding measures on the mission cost. An important result is the estimation of the failure probability for different satellite wall designs including shielding. Shielding requires a modification of the satellite wall. This can result in an increasing complexity of the wall or an increasing mass. As a consequence, the hardware cost increase. To identify suitable shielding measures and to justify the additional financial investments, it is necessary to investigate the economic feasibility of such measures and to demonstrate their benefit.

The Generalized Risk-Adjusted Cost-Effectiveness (Grace) Model For Measuring The Value Of Gains In Health: An Exact Formulation,"The generalized risk-adjusted cost-effectiveness (GRACE) analysis method modifies standard cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), the primary method currently used worldwide to value health improvements arising from healthcare interventions. Generalizing standard CEA, GRACE allows for decreasing or even increasing returns to health. Previous presentations of GRACE have relied extensively on Taylor Series expansion methods to specify key model parameters, including those that properly adjust for illness severity and preexisting disability, consequences of uncertain treatment outcomes, and the marginal rate of substitution between life expectancy and health-related quality of life. Standard CEA cannot account for these sources of value or cost in its valuation of medical treatments. However, calculations of GRACE measures based on Taylor Series are approximations, which may be poorly behaved in some contexts. This paper provides a new approach for implementing GRACE, using exact utility functions instead of Taylor Series approximations. While any proper utility function will suffice, we illustrate with three well-known functions: constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility; hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility, of which CRRA is a special case; and expo-power (EP) utility, of which constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) is a special case. The analysis then extends from two-period to multiperiod models. We discuss methods to estimate parameters of HARA and EP functions using two different types of data, one from discrete choice experiments and the other from ""happiness economics"" methods. We conclude with some reflections on how this analysis might affect benefit-cost analysis studies of healthcare interventions.",NA,NA,10.1017/bca.2023.6,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Satellite Surface Reflectance Improves Habitat Distribution Mapping: A Case Study On Heath And Shrub Formations In The Cantabrian Mountains (Nw Spain),"Aim We aim to map the distribution of four heath and shrub formations constituting habitats of high conservation priority in Europe, whose occurrence is strongly dependent on human activities. Specifically, we assess whether the use of LANDSAT data in habitat distribution modelling may account for land use management, allowing accurate mapping of real distribution patterns. In particular, we explore whether reflectance values may be a better alternative to other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches (i.e. spectral vegetation indices and classified land cover maps). Finally, we test whether modelling performance is affected by the ecological traits of the dominant species of the target formations. Location Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain). Methods We generated maps for the four formations (two specialists vs. two generalists) using MaxEnt. First, we ran the models with environmental predictors only (topography, climate, lithology and human disturbances). Then, we compared the advantages of including, in turn, different data derived from LANDSAT imagery: reflectance values (corresponding to different wavelength channels of the multispectral image), a spectral index and a land cover map. We assessed changes in explanatory power and also in the formations predicted distribution patterns. Results Formations dominated by specialist species were accurately mapped on a base of environmental variables only, whereas those dominated by generalists were overpredicted. Average mean temperature, southness and distance to urban areas were the variables contributing most in predictions of environmental models. LANDSAT channels increased the accuracy of all models, but mainly those for formations dominated by generalist species. They showed advantages against other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches.

Multi-Objective Game Theory Model And Fuzzy Programing Approach For Sustainable Watershed Management,"This study was carried out with the aim of feasibility evaluation of the application of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches for settling balance between economic development and environmental impact as well as to facilitate the respective decision-makings in Zemkan basin, west of Iran. The biobjectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers' priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management.

Method And Gcp-Independent Block Adjustment For Zy-3 Satellite Images,"The spatial and radiation resolutions of domestic satellites have been remarkably improved in recent years. The sensor design and geometric calibration technologies have improved with the development and application of stereo mapping satellites (ZY-3). However, the imaging systems typically use the linear CCD imaging technology. The long focal length and narrow field angle causes the geometrical model to have 3D parallel projection characteristics, and the satellite images will still have residual system errors caused by the drift error of satellite-borne GPS/IMU and asynchrony between the pose and trace of the satellite, especially after the rigorous on-orbit geometry calibration. A block adjustment technique is still required to meet the requirements of remote sensing monitoring and mapping application. Therefore, satellite images-based accurate positioning without ground control point information is the precondition to obtain the global geographic and resource environmental information and monitoring changes in the global resource environment. The accuracy of "" ZY-3"" satellite image is improved to 15 m after calibration and its internal precision is better than 1 pixel. After the overall block adjustment without GCPs, the plane and elevation accuracy of the image can be improved to 5 m (medium error). In this study, on the basis of the widely used optimization method of solving the constraint problem in photogrammetry-alternating direction method (ADM) and RFM least-squares block adjustment, we propose a GCP-independent block adjustment method for large-scale domestic high-resolution optical satellite images-GCP-independent satellite imagery block adjustment (GISIBA) based on the geometric features of ZY-3 satellite images. The proposed method is highly efficient and easy to parallelize. GISIBA of satellite images can be considered as the overall block adjustment of the multi-source optical satellite imagery with specific constraints (distance, angle, etc.) when no ground control points are available. Most GCP-independent adjustments use a form of virtual control points. However, the precision of these virtual control points is low (varied system error), and the precision is inconsistent in the measurement area. Thus, the GCP-independent adjustment is a type of block adjustment under different precision controls. The law of error propagation of this approach is complex, and gross error detection and positioning are difficult to perform using this approach. This study presents an "" average"" virtual control point-based stereoscopic GCP-independent block adjustment method for large-scale satellite image GISIBA. On the basis of the automatic and reliable acquisition of uniformly distributed image tie points, the method comprehensively uses the "" ADM"" introduced from aerial photogrammetry and RFM-based least squares adjustment algorithm to realize the combined block adjustment of satellite images. First, the "" ADM"" is used to solve the initial values of the unknowns and to perform automatic detection and elimination of the above medium-scale gross error based on the parallel processing platform. All unknowns are assigned priori weights based on the results. Next, the RFM-based least square method is used to solve the large-scale reformation normal equation to obtain the orientation parameters with high-precision, which meets the production requirement of high-precision image products. Block adjustment by constructing virtual "" average"" control points addresses the "" rank"" problems in the GCP-independent adjustment and improves the state of normal equation of the block adjustment system, which benefits the stability and fast convergence of the block. Moreover, the method makes it convenient to analyze the relationship among the data coverage, imaging time interval, and satellite image GCP-independent block adjustment. In addition, parallel processing based on the OMP parallel method is used to realize the parallel processing of the "" ADM"" and multi-thread parallel computing based on least-squares adjustment to ensure he efficiency of block adjustment. We used multiple sets of the ZY-3 satellite image data in typical regions to verify our method. The following experiment results are summarized as follows: 1) On the basis of the widely used optimization method of constraint problem called the "" ADM"" and RFM least-squares block adjustment, the proposed GISIBA method is easy to parallelize and is highly efficient in terms of reliability, accuracy, and performance of the developed procedure. 2) In this method, virtual "" average"" control points are built to solve the rank defect problem and qualitative and quantitative analyses in block adjustment without control. Assuming the positioning accuracy is located on the same number order (such as 50 m), the final positioning accuracy of satellite image must be improved after GCP-independent block adjustment by using the virtual "" average"" control points. The final positional accuracy is stronger than the worst initial positioning accuracy of the original image. Furthermore, the increase on the coverage of satellite images does not consistently improve the overall positioning accuracy. However, the use of considerable high-resolution satellite images to cover the same area improves the positioning accuracy after the final block adjustment in the statistical sense. The horizontal and vertical accuracies of multi-covered and multi-temporal satellite images are greater than 6 m and 5 m, respectively. 3) The mosaic problem of adjacent areas in large area DOM production can be solved when third-party geographic information data are introduced as horizontal and vertical constraints. This approach is considered as weak-sense auxiliary control in the block adjustment process. Â© 2019, Science Press.

Do Buyers' Sustainable Supply Chain Management And Stakeholders' Pressure Lead To Better Suppliers' Environmental And Operational Performance?,"Among management research subjects, sustainable supply chain is a major one, in which various enhancements of economic, social, and environmental performance factors are to be considered and proposed through buyer-supplier collaboration. This study contributes to existing literature by answering whether buyer's sustainable supply chain management and stakeholders' pressure lead to better supplier's environmental and operational performance. If the answer is positive, what path could it be? We expect the proactiveness of suppliers' environmental strategy may be the key to balance the potential conflicts between economic benefit and environmental expenditure. Empirical evidences from the 135 suppliers of Taiwan Central Satellite Production System have indicated that SSCM and environmental pressure from the stakeholders have positive impact on the proactiveness of suppliers' environmental strategy. The proactiveness of environmental strategy of suppliers mediates the positive impact of SSCM and stakeholders' environmental pressure on suppliers' operational performance. The proactiveness of environmental strategy of suppliers has a positive impact on supplier's environmental performance. Although it was predicted that the proactive environmental strategy of suppliers might play the mediating role in the relationship among SSCM, stakeholders' environmental pressure and supplier's environmental performance, these two hypotheses were not supported.

Greenhouse Extraction With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using Fused Fully Convolutional Network And Object-Oriented Image Analysis,"The wide application of agricultural greenhouses globally has brought economic benefits; however, it has also led to many environmental problems. The timely and accurate acquisition of greenhouse areas and distribution is valuable for authorities seeking to optimize regional agricultural management and mitigate environmental pollution. Automatic extraction of the greenhouses from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery based on deep learning can reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency to have better application prospects. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel fused fully convolutional network (FCN) optimized by the optimal scale object-oriented segmentation results for agricultural greenhouse extraction from high spatial resolution RS imagery. First, to make full use of remote sensing feature images of target objects and to not increase the complexity of the deep learning network, we constructed a decision-level fusion FCN network that can simultaneously input multiple remote sensing images for preliminary extraction of greenhouse. Second, to address a defect in the classical FCN network causing the easy loss of ground object details, we optimized the preliminary extraction results from FCN by the results of object-oriented segmentation. Finally, the optimized greenhouse extraction results were processed by the mathematical morphology, and the final extraction results were obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Multi-channel fused FCN model could use the unique spectral characteristics of different ground objects. (2) Optimized initial extraction results from FCN based on the optimal scale object-oriented segmentation results could fully maintain the edge details of the greenhouse. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extract the greenhouse effectively. The precision and F value of our proposed method are 92.68\% and 0.94.

In Situ/Remote Sensing Integration To Assess Forest Healtha Review,"For mapping, quantifying and monitoring regional and global forest health, satellite remote sensing provides fundamental data for the observation of spatial and temporal forest patterns and processes. While new remote-sensing technologies are able to detect forest data in high quality and large quantity, operational applications are still limited by deficits of in situ verification. In situ sampling data as input is required in order to add value to physical imaging remote sensing observations and possibilities to interlink the forest health assessment with biotic and abiotic factors. Numerous methods on how to link remote sensing and in situ data have been presented in the scientific literature using e.g. empirical and physical-based models. In situ data differs in type, quality and quantity between case studies. The irregular subsets of in situ data availability limit the exploitation of available satellite remote sensing data. To achieve a broad implementation of satellite remote sensing data in forest monitoring and management, a standardization of in situ data, workflows and products is essential and necessary for user acceptance. The key focus of the review is a discussion of concept and is designed to bridge gaps of understanding between forestry and remote sensing science community. Methodological approaches for in situ/remote-sensing implementation are organized and evaluated with respect to qualifying for forest monitoring. Research gaps and recommendations for standardization of remote-sensing based products are discussed. Concluding the importance of outstanding organizational work to provide a legally accepted framework for new information products in forestry are highlighted.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs8060471,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Remote Sensing For Land Administration 2.0,"Contemporary land administration (LA) systems incorporate the concepts of cadastre and land registration. Conceptually, LA is part of a global land management paradigm incorporating LA functions such as land value, land tenure, land development, and land use. The implementation of land-related policies integrated with well-maintained spatial information reflects the aim set by the United Nations to deliver tenure security for all (Sustainable Development Goal target 1.4, amongst many others). Innovative methods for data acquisition, processing, and maintaining spatial information are needed in response to the global challenges of urbanization and complex urban infrastructure. Current technological developments in remote sensing and geo-spatial information science provide enormous opportunities in this respect. Over the past decade, the increasing usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite and airborne-based acquisitions, as well as active remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR, resulted in high spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution data. Moreover, significant progress has also been achieved in automatic image orientation, surface reconstruction, scene analysis, change detection, classification, and automatic feature extraction with the help of artificial intelligence, spatial statistics, and machine learning. These technology developments, applied to LA, are now being actively demonstrated, piloted, and scaled.

Satellite Remote Sensing For Forestry PlanningâA Review,"This review attempts, from a critical perspective, to put 25 years of satellite remote sensing research into the context of forestry planning. It is limited to temperate and boreal regions and to remote sensing in the visible and near infra-red spectra. It is structured as follows: firstly, the forestry planning problem is defined and information requirements are identified; secondly, the attempts to use satellite remote sensing as an information source for forestry planning are reviewed, divided into the topics inventory and monitoring; and, finally, the methods for extracting forest information from satellite images are re-examined, and their inherent limitations and methodological weaknesses are discussed. It is concluded that satellite images seldom contain enough information to support the decision process in applied forestry. Although regional level applications may be useful, few successful and reliable applications for local forest inventory, planning or damage monitoring have evolved. Stratification for multi-stage sampling and monitoring of clear-cuts are areas in which satellite images have been shown to be feasible. However, it is doubtful whether the costs involved can be justified for such uses alone. A further conclusion is that many studies have adopted simplistic views of the information needs in the forestry planning process. These studies do not relate the analysis to management decisions, but instead assume that plain and approximate mapping of the forest has a great value. Present developments in the discipline involve complex modelling of reflectance, taking into consideration internal shading, topography and other features, yet without dramatic improvements compared with earlier studies. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing and digital image analysis are no longer technologically spectacular, facts which may affect future research in the discipline. It is, perhaps, time to draw the conclusion that current satellite sensors are not in general suitable for forestry planning, since (a) they contain little relevant information, and (b) for forest management planning purposes there are often more efficient ways of collecting the information required.

Mission Capability Estimation Of Multicopter Uav For Low-Altitude Remote Sensing,"Restricted mission capability becomes one of the most important challenges facing multicopter UAVs with the increasing complexity of the low-altitude remote sensing mission. Mission capability estimation is the major precondition and the foundation of the mission planning, decomposition, and execution. It's constrained by platform performance, payload characteristics, mission requirements, and environmental conditions. Flight energy consumption has become the main capability metric criterion of multicopter UAVs in coverage path planning based remote sensing missions. Modeling on flight energy consumption has been the principal subject of many pieces of research. However, current models have not established a connection between inflight performance and remote sensing mission characteristics. Therefore, a mechanistic model is proposed in this study to estimate a multicopter UAV's mission capability during the mission planning procedure. This model is based on the combination of multicopter flight mechanics and remote sensing mission-oriented coverage path planning theories. The field wind condition is taken into consideration as well. The applicability and performance of the model were evaluated by combining simulation and 60 field mission sorties. The model estimated results are in accordance with the true values. The mean error in the total energy consumption is 5\% of the battery used in the experiment. This model will ultimately provide a theoretical basis for mission decision making, help to reduce the low-battery risk and guarantee the safety and efficiency of mission operations prior.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10846-020-01199-9,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
"Aquasafe: A Remote Sensing, Web-Based Platform For The Support Of Precision Fish Farming","Marine aquaculture has been expanding rapidly in recent years, driven by the growing demand for marine products. However, this expansion has led to increased competition for space and resources with other coastal zone activities, which has resulted in the need for larger facilities and the relocation of operations to offshore areas. Moreover, the complex environment and exposure to environmental conditions and external threats further complicate the sustainable development of the sector. To address these challenges, new and innovative technologies are needed, such as the incorporation of remote sensing and in-situ data for comprehensive and continuous monitoring of aquaculture facilities. This study aims to create an integrated monitoring and decision support system utilizing both satellite and in-situ data to monitor aquaculture facilities on various scales, providing information on water quality, fish growth, and warning signs to alert managers and producers of potential hazards. This study focuses on identifying and estimating parameters that affect aquaculture processes, establishing indicators that can act as warning signs, and evaluating the system's performance in real-life scenarios. The resulting monitoring tool, called ""Aquasafe"", was evaluated for its effectiveness and performance by test users through real-life scenarios. The results of the implemented models showed high accuracy, with an R-2 value of 0.67. Additionally, users were generally satisfied with the usefulness of the tool, suggesting that it holds promise for efficient management and decision making in marine aquaculture.",NA,NA,10.3390/app13106122,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
A Simple Remote Sensing Based Information System For Monitoring Sites Of Conservation Importance,"Monitoring is essential for conservation of sites, but capacity to undertake it in the field is often limited. Data collected by remote sensing has been identified as a partial solution to this problem, and is becoming a feasible option, since increasing quantities of satellite data in particular are becoming available to conservationists. When suitably classified, satellite imagery can be used to delineate land cover types such as forest, and to identify any changes over time. However, the conservation community lacks (a) a simple tool appropriate to the needs for monitoring change in all types of land cover (e.g. not just forest), and (b) an easily accessible information system which allows for simple land cover change analysis and data sharing to reduce duplication of effort. To meet these needs, we developed a web-based information system which allows users to assess land cover dynamics in and around protected areas (or other sites of conservation importance) from multi-temporal medium resolution satellite imagery. The system is based around an open access toolbox that pre-processes and classifies Landsat-type imagery, and then allows users to interactively verify the classification. These data are then open for others to utilize through the online information system. We first explain imagery processing and data accessibility features, and then demonstrate the toolbox and the value of user verification using a case study on Nakuru National Park, Kenya. Monitoring and detection of disturbances can support implementation of effective protection, assist the work of park managers and conservation scientists, and thus contribute to conservation planning, priority assessment and potentially to meeting monitoring needs for Aichi target 11.",NA,NA,10.1002/rse2.14,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Multi-Objective Optimization Of Methane Production System From Biomass Through Anaerobic Digestion,"This work addressed the multi-objective optimization of a biogas production system considering both environmental and economic criteria. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model was established and solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, from which the Pareto fronts, the optimal technology combinations and operation conditions were obtained and analyzed. It's found that the system is feasible in both environmental and economic considerations after optimization. The most expensive processing section is decarbonization; the most expensive equipment is anaerobic digester; the most power-consuming processing section is digestion, followed by decarbonization and waste management. The positive green degree value on the process is attributed to processing section of digestion and waste management. 3:1 chicken feces and corn straw, solar energy, pressure swing adsorption and 3:1 chicken feces and rice straw, solar energy, pressure swing adsorption are turned out to be two robust technology combinations under different prices of methane and electricity by sensitivity analysis. The optimization results provide support for optimal design and operation of biogas production system considering environmental and economic objectives.

Assessing The Welfare Impacts Of Forest Ecosystem Service Management Policies And Their Distributional Rules,"Community based management (CBM) is widely advocated as an effective method for governing and managing ecosystem services (ES). However, the distributional rules and maximum harvesting levels are likely to affect both the effectiveness of CBMs in maintaining ES and the fairness and equity of access to these ES. This article proposes a methodological approach for investigating normative trade-offs involved in CBM of forests, where forest conservation objectives need to be traded off against livelihoods objectives. The study uses remote sensing methods to quantify forest ES supply in Namizimu Forest Reserve in Malawi, and links this to demand for ES within the villages near the reserve. It then investigates how a plausible set of CBM rules can be developed to cap consumption of forest products to sustainable amount and quantifies, by using monetary valuation techniques, how these set of rules may affect the total well-being of local population. Our results demonstrate that, due to the spatial mismatches between demand and supply, the distribution of provisioning ES to the population across the harvesting area is unequal in biophysical terms. The current available stock of forest products is sufficient to cover the current demand, however, it is higher than the mean annual increment indicating that this level of consumption is ecologically unsustainable and will lead to forest degradation as shown under the business-as-usual scenario. We then examined the impact of governance and how CBM rules to allocate forest ES to different social groups (poor and rich) under a co-management regime will affect total societal welfare. We found that the distributional scenario that maximises total societal welfare expressed in monetary terms across the whole harvesting area is the scenario that distributes 40\% of biomass to the rich group while the remaining 60\% is allocated to the poor group. However, this scenario maximises Willingness to Pay (WTP) at total level but does not maximise WTP in each sub-area of forest but just for those that have a high availability for biomass. This indicates that the distributional rules that maximise total welfare at aggregate level may not maximise welfare at local level where constraints from biomass availability require to restrict further the distribution of forest products. When biomass availability is low, total societal welfare is maximised with distributional rules that distribute more trees to richer. Yet, a policymaker may choose a distributional rule that distribute more trees to the poor on normative grounds and forego the objective of maximising total welfare. In such cases the WTP analysis outlined in this paper can support the policymaker in choosing the distributional rule that minimise trade-offs between efficiency, i.e., maximising total welfare, and livelihoods objectives.",NA,NA,10.3389/ffgc.2022.780036,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Npoess Next-Generation Operational Global Earth Observations,"The United States is merging its two polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite programs operated by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense into a single system, which is called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). During the next decade, NPOESS will provide global operational data to meet many of the needs of weather forecasters, climate researchers, and global decision makers for remotely sensed Earth science data and global environmental monitoring. The NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) will be launched in 2011 as a precursor to NPOESS to reduce final development risks for NPOESS and to provide continuity of global imaging and atmospheric sounding data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) missions. Beginning in 2014, NPOESS spacecraft will be launched into an afternoon orbit and in 2016 into an early-morning orbit to provide significantly improved operational capabilities and benefits to satisfy critical civil and national security requirements for space-based, remotely sensed environmental data. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Meteorological Operation (MetOp) spacecraft will complement NPOESS in a midmorning orbit. The joint constellation will provide global coverage with a data refresh rate of approximately four hours. NPOESS will observe more phenomena simultaneously from space and deliver a data volume significantly greater than its operational predecessors with substantially improved data delivery to users. Higher-resolution (spatial and spectral) and more accurate imaging and atmospheric sounding data will enable improvements in short-to medium-range weather forecasts. Multispectral and hyperspectral instruments on NPOESS will provide global imagery and sounding products useful to the forecaster that are complementary to those available from geostationary satellites. NPOESS will support the operational needs of meteorological, oceanographic, environmental, climatic, and space environmental remote sensing programs and provide continuity of data for climate researchers.

Assessment Of Landsat-Based Evapotranspiration Using Weighing Lysimeters In The Texas High Plains,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the largest data gaps in water management due to the limited availability of measured evapotranspiration data, and because ET spatial variability is difficult to characterize at various scales. Satellite-based ET estimation has been shown to have great potential for water resource planning and for estimating agricultural water use at field, watershed, and regional scales. Satellites with low spatial resolution, such as NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and those with higher spatial resolution, such as Landsat (Land Satellite), can potentially be used for irrigation water management purposes and other agricultural applications. The objective of this study is to assess satellite based-ET estimation accuracy using measured ET from large weighing lysimeters. Daily, seven-day running average, monthly, and seasonal satellite-based ET data were compared with corresponding lysimeter ET data. This study was performed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) in Bushland, Texas, USA. The daily time series Landsat ET estimates were characterized as poor for irrigated fields, with a Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) of 0.37, and good for monthly ET, with an NSE of 0.57. For the dryland managed fields, the daily and monthly ET estimates were unacceptable with an NSE of -1.38 and -0.19, respectively. There are various reasons for these results, including uncertainties with remotely sensed data due to errors in aerodynamic resistance surface roughness length estimation, surface temperature deviations between irrigated and dryland conditions, poor leaf area estimation in the METRIC model under dryland conditions, extended gap periods between satellite data, and using the linear interpolation method to extrapolate daily ET values between two consecutive scenes (images).",NA,NA,10.3390/agronomy10111688,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}

Comparison Of The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi) Between The Sensors Oli-Landsat Satellite-8 And Msi-Sentinel-2 Satellite In Semi-Arid Region,"The use of remote sensing techniques in support of environmental studies has become common in recent years, and the availability of satellite images for free has also boosted this growth. The use of orbital images for the accomplishment of these studies allows a reduction of the costs involved, greater agility and constancy in the access to the data and, it consents, a holistic evaluation, analyzing with more precision and detail several environmental components present in the region of interest. This paper aimed to analyze the spectral responses in the visible and infrared bands and to compare values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained by the OLI - Landsat 8 and MSI - Sentinel 2 sensors in the semi - arid region that comprises part of the territory of the basin of the MoxotÃ³ river. When analyzing the spectral response of each of the sensors, it is evident that there are clear differences between the bands that provide the computation of the NDVI, which are the red and near infrared bands that could generate different values of the same index in the same area. Despite the differences between the Landsat-8 / OLI and Sentinel-2 / MSI optical sensors, they presented similar statistical moments between the bands compared. The NDVI in the studied period presented mean values for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 equal to 0.383 and 0.387, respectively, and a strong correlation equal to 0.871 among the sensors. The MSI-Sentinel-2 sensor allowed a greater delineation of the targets due to its greater spatial resolution, allowing greater confidence for monitoring and management of the environment.

Feature Weighted Attention-Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Model For Change Detection In Remote Sensing Images,"In remote sensing images, change detection (CD) is required in many applications, such as: resource management, urban expansion research, land management, and disaster assessment. Various deep learning-based methods were applied to satellite image analysis for change detection, yet many of them have limitations, including the overfitting problem. This research proposes the Feature Weighted Attention (FWA) in Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) method to reduce the overfitting problem and increase the performance of classification in change detection applications. Additionally, data usage and accuracy in remote sensing activities, particularly CD, can be significantly improved by a large number of training models based on BiLSTM. Normalization techniques are applied to input images in order to enhance the quality and reduce the difference in pixel value. The AlexNet and VGG16 models were used to extract useful features from the normalized images. The extracted features were then applied to the FWA-BiLSTM model, to give more weight to the unique features and increase the efficiency of classification. The attention layer selects the unique features that help to distinguish the changes in the remote sensing images. From the experimental results, it was clearly shown that the proposed FWA-BiLSTM model achieved better performance in terms of precision (93.43\%), recall (93.16\%), and overall accuracy (99.26\%), when compared with the existing Difference-enhancement Dense-attention Convolutional Neural Network (DDCNN) model.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14215402,"{""change detect algo""}",excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Auto-Detection And Hiding Of Sensitive Targets In Emergency Mapping Based On Remote Sensing Data,"Objectives: Emergency remote sensing mapping can provide support for decision-making in disaster assessment or disaster relief, and therefore plays an important role in disaster response.Traditional emergency remote sensing mapping methods use the decryption algorithms based on manual retrieval and image editing tools when processing sensitive targets. Although the traditional methods can achieve target recognition, they are inefficient and cannot meet the immediate requirements of disaster relief, which are unable to be released or applied in time. The main objective is to propose a method for auto-detecting and hiding of sensitive targets in emergency remote sensing mapping to accelerate the rapid production and release emergency remote sensing products.Methods: Because of the huge size of remote sensing images, it is not realistic to directly hide sensitive targets. We propose a two-stage processing method automatic target detection and hiding of sensitive targets method, which consists of two neural network models: target detection model and generative adversarial network model. Firstly, Mask R-CNN, a well-known and effective target detection method, was used to detect sensitive targets from massive remote sensing data and generate target coordinates and Masks. Then, Deepfill model, one of GAN(generative adversarial networks) models, can ignore other normal areas and directly hide sensitive objects in the local area based on the coordinates and Masks information. The aircraft objects in the remote sensing image was used as an application example to verify the feasibility of our method, furthermore, we added the reconstruction of loss function, candidate frame optimization of region recommendation network, Mask optimization algorithm, and attention mechanism reconstruction based on the characteristics of the aircraft objects. Mask R-CNN model and Deepfill model have different training principles, so we trained and tuned them separately, and finally combine the trained models. We randomly extracted images from RSOD(remote sensing object detection) and DOTA(a large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images) to form a new dataset. A total of 1 607 images were obtained for Mask R-CNN model training, and 9 502 images were used for Deepfill model training. All these samples are divided into training set and verification set according to the ratio of 0.8: 0.2. The performance of the Mask R-CNN model was evaluated by precision, recall rate, missing detect rate and F1-score; the performance evaluation indicators of the Deepfill model are PSNR(peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM(structural similarity).Results: 46 images were extracted separately from the original dataset to test the performance of the trained models. In the target detect stage, the accuracy of the benchmark model was 98.13%, the recall rate was 44.21%, the missed detection rate was 55.79%, and the F1-score was 60.96%. Many targets were not detected. For comparison, the accuracy of our method reaches 94.65%, the recall rate reaches 81.89%, which is 85.23% higher than the benchmark model; the missed detection rate reaches 18.11%, which is 67.54% lower than the benchmark model; the F1-score reaches 87.81%, which is 44.05% higher than the benchmark model. In the inpainting stage, the average PSNR in this method reaches 32.26, and the average SSIM value is 0.98.Conclusions: In the proposed method, the recall rate and F1-score of aircraft targets in remote sensing images have been significantly improved, the inpainting processing effect is reasonable and natural, and the overall time of the emergency remote sensing mapping process is saved, indicating that the two-stage model works well. In the future, it can further expand the detection and processing of other sensitive targets, accelerate the production and release efficiency of disaster emergency response map products, and thus improve the ability of disaster prevention and relief.

Applicability Of Ordinary Kriging Modeling Techniques For Filling Satellite Data Gaps In Support Of Coastal Management,"Effective coastal zone management relies on accurate and sound data of environmental parameters. In many cases, however, lack of pertinent environmental variable datasets hinders the development of sustainable policies and practices. Marine remote sensing has been used extensively to provide such datasets, with limited success due to different spatial resolutions, non-overlapping grids, and different spatial extent, since, in most cases, they are derived from miscellaneous sources. Several methods have been proposed aiming to overcome this problem and enable remote-sensing techniques to attain the highest possible applicability in coastal ecosystem management studies. Most of these techniques use interpolation modeling techniques for satellite data gap filling near the shoreline. This paper presents the use of the Ordinary Kriging (OK) methodology, as an interpolator of satellite data, from miscellaneous and variant environmental datasets of the territorial waters of the Heraklion Prefecture, on the island of Crete. The applicability of OK in satellite data gap filling was examined by the use of cross-validation, taking into account resolution levels for optimum estimations. In addition, a number of diagnostic statistics were employed to evaluate the performance of the interpolation models used. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is valid and independent of remote-sensing data characteristics, thus proving that OK can be used to homogenize effectively and integrate fully diverse satellite datasets. This study concludes that the methodology described in predicting estimates of missing values of satellite data with statistical certainty can be used as an effective tool in coastal management.",NA,NA,10.1007/s40808-020-00940-5,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Anticipating Social Equity Impacts In Redd Plus Policy Design: An Example From The Democratic Republic Of Congo,"Equity is a sensitive topic discussed under the REDD + mechanism. This study focuses on the impact of prevailing social and ecological conditions on the potential equity outcome of REDD + intervention at the local level. Working at a REDD + pilot project site in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we present a quantitative framework to assess contextual equity at the village level. We conducted a full community census on household characteristics and livelihood practices to evaluate current social conditions. We used participatory mapping and remote sensing analysis of a time series of very high resolution imagery over a 10-year period within the village boundaries to examine the ecological context of land use. We identify important differences between 379 households in terms of social characteristics and livelihoods practices. Social differentiation strongly relates to customary land rights as well as gender, ethnicity and origin. Using this case study, we find REDD + activities that can be implemented under the prevailing ecological conditions could impact community members differently, by reducing access to land for a segment of the population that is already under stress, and therefore have implications on equity in both space and time. We identify important risks for sectors of the population that do not have the contextual features necessary for benefitting from REDD + implementation and may be impacted, directly and indirectly, by decisions linked to benefit-sharing. We argue that such quantitative assessment is valuable to inform REDD + policy design on the way livelihood practices and social characteristics are inter linked and how they affect forest cover change. This information can be used to anticipate potential equity issues that may arise with REDD + implementation. We suggest that contextually informed definitions of the benefits and costs are critical for achieving equity in benefit-sharing. A flexible adaptive management and equity conscious approach is recommended from the policy design to implementation, by anticipating and mitigating potential risks of REDD + interventions in order to promote equitable outcomes at the local level.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.03.011,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Decision Support Toolkit For Integrated Analysis And Design Of Reclaimed Water Infrastructure,"Planning of water reuse systems is a complex endeavor. We have developed a software toolkit, IRIPT (Integrated Urban Reclaimed Water Infrastructure Planning Toolkit) that facilitates planning and design of reclaimed water infrastructure for both centralized and hybrid configurations that incorporate satellite treatment plants (STPs). The toolkit includes a Pipeline Designer (PRODOT) that optimizes routing and sizing of pipelines for wastewater capture and reclaimed water distribution, a Selector (SeIWTP) that assembles and optimizes wastewater treatment trains, and a Calculator (CalcBenefit) that estimates fees, revenues, and subsidies of alternative designs. For hybrid configurations, a Locator (LocSTP) optimizes siting of STPs and associated wastewater diversions by identifying manhole locations where the, flow rates are sufficient to ensure that wastewater extracted and treated at an adjacent STP can generate the revenue needed to pay for treatment and delivery to customers. Practical local constraints are also applied to screen and identify STP locations. Once suitable sites are selected, System Integrator (Tool Integrator) identifies a set of centralized and hybrid configurations that: (1) maximize reclaimed water supply, (2) maximize reclaimed water supply while also ensuring a financial benefit for the system, and (3) maximize the net financial benefit for the system. The resulting configurations are then evaluated by an Analyst (SANNA) that uses monetary and non-monetary criteria, with weights assigned to appropriate metrics by a decision-maker, to identify a preferred configuration. To illustrate the structure, assumptions, and use, of IRIPT, we apply it to a case study for the city of Golden, CO. The criteria weightings provided by a local decision-maker lead to a preference for a centralized configuration in this case. The Golden case study demonstrates that IRIPT can efficiently analyze centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations and rank them according to decision-makers' preferences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Optimization Of Intersatellite Link Assignment Based On Reinforcement Learning,"Intersatellite links can reduce the dependence of satellite communication systems on ground networks, reduce the number of ground gateways, and reduce the complexity and investment of ground networks, which are important future trends in satellite development. Intersatellite links are dynamic over time, and different intersatellite topologies have a great impact on satellite network performance. To improve the overall performance of satellite networks, a satellite link assignment optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. Different from the swarm intelligence method in principle, this algorithm models the combinatorial optimization problem of links as the optimal sequence decision problem of a series of link selection actions. Realistic constraints such as intersatellite visibility, network connectivity, and number of antenna beams are regarded as fully observable environmental factors. The agent selects the link according to the decision, and the selection action utility affects the next selection decision. After a finite number of iterations, the optimal link assignment scheme with minimum link delay is achieved. The simulation results show that in 8 or 12 satellite network systems, compared with the original topology, the topology calculated by this method has better network delay and smaller delay variance.",NA,NA,10.1177/15501477211070202,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Innovative Methods For The Benefit Of Public Health Using Space Technologies For Disaster Response,"Space applications have evolved to play a significant role in disaster relief by providing services including remote sensing imagery for mitigation and disaster damage assessments; satellite communication to provide access to medical services; positioning, navigation, and timing services; and data sharing. Common issues identified in past disaster response and relief efforts include lack of communication, delayed ordering of actions (eg, evacuations), and low levels of preparedness by authorities during and after disasters. We briefly summarize the Space for Health (S4H) Team Project, which was prepared during the Space Studies Program 2014 within the International Space University. The S4H Project aimed to improve the way space assets and experiences are used in support of public health during disaster relief efforts. We recommend an integrated solution based on nano-satellites or a balloon communication system, mobile self-contained relief units, portable medical scanning devices, and micro-unmanned vehicles that could revolutionize disaster relief and disrupt different markets. The recommended new system of coordination and communication using space assets to support public health during disaster relief efforts is feasible. Nevertheless, further actions should be taken by governments and organizations in collaboration with the private sector to design, test, and implement this system.",NA,NA,10.1017/dmp.2015.29,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Mobile Technologies And Services For Environmental Monitoring: The Citi-Sense-Mob Approach,"The impact of mobile technologies on the Citizens' Observatory in the areas of air quality, environmental health and climate change, has the potential to significantly improve data coverage by the provision of near-real-time high-resolution data over urban areas.

Underground Water Level Prediction In Remote Sensing Images Using Improved Hydro Index Value With Ensemble Classifier,"The economic sustainability of aquifers across the world relies on accurate and rapid estimates of groundwater storage changes, but this becomes difficult due to the absence of in-situ groundwater surveys in most areas. By closing the water balance, hydrologic remote sensing measures offer a possible method for quantifying changes in groundwater storage. However, it is uncertain to what extent remote sensing data can provide an accurate assessment of these changes. Therefore, a new framework is implemented in this work for predicting the underground water level using remote sensing images. Generally, the water level is defined into five levels: Critical, Overexploited, Safe, Saline, and Semi-critical, based on water quantity. In this manuscript, the remote sensing images were acquired from remote sensing images. At first, Wiener filtering was employed for preprocessing. Secondly, the Vegetation Indexes (VI) (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Infrared index (IRI), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI)), and statistical features (entropy, Root Mean Square (RMS), Skewness, and Kurtosis) were extracted from the preprocessed remote sensing images. Then, the extracted features were combined as a novel hydro index, which was fed to the Ensemble Classifier (EC): Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models for underground water level prediction in the remote sensing images. The obtained results prove the efficacy of the proposed framework by using different performance measures. The results shows that the False Positive Rate (FPR) of the proposed EC model is 0.0083, which is better than that of existing methods. On the other hand, the proposed EC model has a high accuracy of 0.90, which is superior to the existing traditional models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU).",NA,NA,10.3390/rs15082015,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Application Of Geospatial Technologies For Environmental Impact Assessment: An Indian Scenario,"Geospatial technology is an essential component of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, as environmental resources are directly affected by changes in the shape and extent of the proposed disturbance. With the use of spatial techniques like remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems, and Global Positioning Systems, EIA has enhanced substantial viewing, movement, query, and even map-making capabilities. However, one of the main challenges is to have access to the most up-to-date and accurate geospatial data and interpretations. With an emphasis on using geospatial data in particular, the value of the information resource is far higher than is generally available with text and numeric information. This paper focuses on discussing the application of geospatial tools in environmental monitoring and the effective analysis of the natural resources for developmental planning, policy formulation, and decision-making. Several specific relevant applications of geospatial tools to integrate EIA are presented in the context of an Indian scenario. Applications have included monitoring of natural resources (air, water, land, etc.), ground-level ozone, soil erosion, study of sea-level rise due to global warming, change-detection studies, delineation of ecologically sensitive areas using digital-image analysis and Geographic Information Systems. This study focuses on the possibility of using a proposed spatial-decision-support system to conduct EIA, which should make it possible to upload, evaluate, maintain, and report field and analytical data that have been stored in a variety of formats.",NA,NA,10.1080/01431160701269002,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A New Framework Of 17 Hydrological Ecosystem Services (Hess17) For Supporting River Basin Planning And Environmental Monitoring,"Hydrological ecosystem services (HESS) describe the benefits of water for multiple purposes with an emphasis on environmental values. The value of HESS is often not realized because primary benefits (e.g., food production, water withdrawals) get the most attention. Secondary benefits such as water storage, purification or midday temperature cooling are often overlooked. This results in an incorrect evaluation of beneficial water usage in urban and rural resettlements and misunderstandings when land use changes are introduced. The objective of this paper is to propose a standard list of 17 HESS indicators that are in line with the policy and philosophy of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and that are measurable with earth observation technologies in conjunction with GIS and hydrological models. The HESS17 framework considered indicators that can be directly related to water flows, water fluxes and water stocks; they have a natural characteristic with minimal anthropogenic influence and must be quantifiable by means of earth observation models in combination with GIS and hydrological models. The introduction of a HESS framework is less meaningful without proper quantification procedures in place. Because of the widely diverging management options, the role of water should be categorized as (i) consumptive use (i.e., evapotranspiration and dry matter production) and (ii) non-consumptive use (stream flow, recharge, water storage). Governments and responsible agencies for integrated water management should recognize the need to include HESS17 in water allocation policies, water foot-printing, water accounting, transboundary water management, food security purposes and spatial land-use planning processes. The proposed HESS17 framework and associated methods can be used to evaluate land, soil and water conservation programs. This paper presents a framework that is non-exhaustive but can be realistically computed and applicable across spatial scales.",NA,NA,10.3390/su15076182,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Free And Open-Access Satellite Data Are Key To Biodiversity Conservation,"Satellite remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring the status of biodiversity and associated environmental parameters, including certain elements of habitats. However, satellite data are currently underused within the biodiversity research and conservation communities. Three factors have significant impact on the utility of remote sensing data for tracking and understanding biodiversity change. They are its continuity, affordability, and access. Data continuity relates to the maintenance of long-term satellite data products. Such products promote knowledge of how biodiversity has changed over time and why. Data affordability arises from the cost of the imagery. New data policies promoting free and open access to government satellite imagery are expanding the use of certain imagery but the number of free and open data sets remains too limited. Data access addresses the ability of conservation biologists and biodiversity researchers to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and extract value from satellite imagery as well as link it with other types of information. Tools are rapidly improving access. Still, more cross-community interactions are necessary to strengthen ties between the biodiversity and remote sensing communities.

Land Use And Land Cover Mapping In Wetlands One Step Closer To The Ground: Sentinel-2 Versus Landsat 8,"Environmental studies with Landsat images have revealed many of the problems faced by wetland ecosystem, which are crucial for the conservation of biodiversity and the natural values of our planet. The study of LULC changes in wetlands through remote sensing constantly helps to identify and combat their main environmental threats improving the conservation of these natural habitats. Starting in mid-2015, the Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities in the field of earth observation thanks to its higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolution becoming a powerful source of information for LULC monitoring in wetland areas. However, researchers may ask them selves to what extent Sentinel-2 is an improvement over Landsat 8 for general purposes. This research test if there is a real difference in the quality of the results delivered by both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery when basic classification methods are applied. The study uses Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery to produce LULC maps in a Mediterranean wetland area applying an object based classification method in order to compare the accuracy and reliability in the surface detected by both satellites. The results show that an object based classification using only the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 image information, without band indexes or ancillary data, offers very similar results for most LULC classes, being the overall accuracy around 87â88% with slightly better results when using Sentinel-2. Although using Sentinel-2 leads to an increase in file size and processing times, the analysis of certain LULC classes presents an improvement compared to Landsat 8, detecting more linear and small size elements with a better delineation of image features in the classified map. However, these improvements should not underestimate the value of Landsat imagery in the future since both satellites provide high precision information, so they can and should coexist and be used together to increase data availability in order to have the best possible results in remote sensing research.

Fuzzy Object-Based Image Analysis Methods Using Sentinel-2a And Landsat-8 Data To Map And Characterize Soil Surface Residue,"Soil degradation, defined as the lowering and loss of soil functions, is becoming a serious problem worldwide and threatens agricultural production and terrestrial ecosystems. The surface residue of crops is one of the most effective erosion control measures and it increases the soil moisture content. In some areas of the world, the management of soil surface residue (SSR) is crucial for increasing soil fertility, maintaining high soil carbon levels, and reducing the degradation of soil due to rain and wind erosion. Standard methods of measuring the residue cover are time and labor intensive, but remote sensing can support the monitoring of conservation tillage practices applied to large fields. We investigated the potential of per-pixel and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for detecting and estimating the coverage of SSRs after tillage and planting practices for agricultural research fields in Iran using tillage indices for Landsat-8 and novel indices for Sentinel-2A. For validation, SSR was measured in the field through line transects at the beginning of the agricultural season (prior to autumn crop planting). Per-pixel approaches for Landsat-8 satellite images using normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and simple tillage index (STI) yielded coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.727 and 0.722, respectively. We developed comparable novel indices for Sentinel-2A satellite data that yielded R-2 values of 0.760 and 0.759 for NDTI and STI, respectively, which means that the Sentinel data better matched the ground truth data. We tested several OBIA methods and achieved very high overall accuracies of up to 0.948 for Sentinel-2A and 0.891 for Landsat-8 with a membership function method. The OBIA methods clearly outperformed per-pixel approaches in estimating SSR and bear the potential to substitute or complement ground-based techniques.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11212583,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Suitability Of Satellite Remote Sensing Data For Yield Estimation In Northeast Germany,"Information provided by satellite data is becoming increasingly important in the field of agriculture. Estimating biomass, nitrogen content or crop yield can improve farm management and optimize precision agriculture applications. A vast amount of data is made available both as map material and from space. However, it is up to the user to select the appropriate data for a particular problem. Without the appropriate knowledge, this may even entail an economic risk. This study therefore investigates the direct relationship between satellite data from six different optical sensors as well as different soil and relief parameters and yield data from cereal and canola recorded by the thresher in the field. A time series of 13 years is considered, with 947 yield data sets consisting of dense point data sets and 755 satellite images. To answer the question of how well the relationship between remote sensing data and yield is, the correlation coefficient r per field is calculated and interpreted in terms of crop type, phenology, and sensor characteristics. The correlation value r is particularly high when a field and its crop are spatially heterogeneous and when the correct phenological time of the crop is reached at the time of satellite imaging. Satellite images with higher resolution, such as RapidEye and Sentinel-2 performed better in comparison with lower resolution sensors of the Landsat series. The additional Red Edge spectral band also has advantage, especially for cereal yield estimation. The study concludes that there are high correlation values between yield data and satellite data, but several conditions must be met which are presented and discussed here.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11119-021-09827-6,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Thematic Portfolio Optimization: Challenging The Core Satellite Approach,"In recent years, thematic exchange-traded funds (ETF) have increased in economic significance. Investors in thematic ETFs have more than just financial objectives and gain a non-monetary added value from a thematic portion in their portfolios. Therefore, traditional portfolio optimization models which target only financial criteria cannot suit these investors' needs anymore. Nevertheless, to account for their thematic interests, investors adapt a core satellite strategy in which conventional core portfolios and thematic satellite portfolios are combined. Thus, these portfolios are separately optimized without further considering inter-portfolio correlation effects. Since modern portfolio theory has originally been established to, inter alia, optimize these correlation effects, portfolios can only be efficient by chance. Therefore, this study targets the correlation effects between conventional and thematic portfolios and uses a tri-criterion thematic portfolio optimization model as an overall framework. Throughout a two-part analysis with tradable ETFs and a simulation with 250,000 draws and 1,750,000 portfolio optimizations performed, the status quo is compared to the tri-criterion model. Quantifying the suboptimality, simulation results show a mean portfolio improvement of 6.23\% measured as relative yield enhancement. Further, our analysis concludes that the more narrowly a theme is defined and the more particular it is, relative yield enhancements can increase up to 46.88\%.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11408-019-00329-0,{},excluded,"{""No societal value context"",""ESI data not used""}"
Disruptive Technologies For Improving Water Security In Large River Basins,"Large river basins present significant challenges for water resource planning and management. They typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic regimes, are characterized by complex and variable hydrology, and span multiple jurisdictions with diverse water demands and values. They are often data-poor and in many developing economies are characterized by weak water governance. Rapid global change is seeing significant changes to the pressures on the water resources of large basins, exacerbating the challenge of sustainable water management. Diverse technologies have long supported water resource planning and development, from data collection, analytics, simulation, to decision-making, and real-time operations. In the last two decades however, a rapid increase in the range, capability, and accessibility of new technologies, coupled with large reductions in cost, mean there are increasing opportunities for emerging technologies to significantly ""disrupt"" traditional approaches to water resources management. In this paper, we consider the application of 'disruptive technologies' in water resources management in large river basins, through a lens of improving water security. We discuss the role of different actors and institutions for water management considering a range of emerging disruptive technologies. We consider the risks and benefits associated with the use of these technologies and discuss the barriers to their widespread adoption. We obverse a positive trend away from the reliance solely on centralized government institutions and traditional modeling for the collection and analysis of data, towards a more open and dynamic 'data and knowledge ecosystem' that draws upon data services at different levels (global to local) to support water planning and operations. We expect that technological advances and cost reductions will accelerate, fueling increased incremental adoption of new technologies in water resources planning and management. Large-basin analytics could become virtually free for users with global, regional, and national development agencies absorbing the costs of development and any subscription services for end users (e.g., irrigators) to help improve water management at user level and improve economic productivity. Collectively, these changes can help to 'democratize' water management through improved access to data and information. However, disruptive technologies can also be deployed in top-down or centralized processes, and so their use is sometimes contested or misunderstood. Increased attention therefore needs to be given to ensuring equity in technology access, and to strengthening the governance context for technology deployment. Widespread adoption of disruptive technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals are trained, increased adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations, and careful consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues.",NA,NA,10.3390/w12102783,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Vegetation Monitoring For Guatemala: A Comparison Between Simulated Viirs And Modis Satellite Data,"The advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are being widely used for vegetation monitoring across the globe.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning to launch a new sensor, visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS), to continue to provide satellite data for vegetation monitoring. This article presents a case study of Guatemala and compares the simulated VIIRS-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with MODIS-NDVI for four different dates each in 2003 and 2005. The dissimilarity between VIIRS-NDVI and MODIS-NDVI was examined on the basis of the percent difference, the two-tailed student's t-test, and the coefficient of determination, R2. The per cent difference was found to be within 3%, the p-value ranged between 0.52 and 0.99, and R2 exceeded 0.88 for all major types of vegetation (basic grains, rubber, sugarcane, coffee and forests) found in Guatemala. It was therefore concluded that VIIRS will be almost equally capable of vegetation monitoring as MODIS.

Real-World Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution Via A Practical Degradation Model And A Kernel-Aware Network,"Super-resolution is an essential task in remote sensing.

Promoting Tech Transfer Between Space And Global Mental Health,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous issues in mental health benefit from technological innovation. An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors,'omics', and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space. METHODS: We prepared a systematic review of studies pertaining to mental health technological innovation and space medicine. RESULTS: For Earth mental health technologies translatable to long-duration space missions, we cite several example technologies, including device-based psychotherapy and social support, conversational agents 'aka chatbots', and nutritional and physical activity focused mental health. Space technologies translatable to Earth mental health include remote sensing devices, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, chronotherapies, and nutritional advances. DISCUSSION: There is a rich history of space technologies informing Earth technological trends, including general health care on Earth, and vice versa. To avoid the traditional happenstance approach that results in delays, missed opportunities, and increased cost, and to improve outcomes for both Earth and space utilization of these technologies, we propose increased dialogue and training opportunities to enhance innovation and outcomes.",NA,NA,10.3357/amhp.5589.2020,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Progress And Prospect Of Chinese Ocean Satellites,"China attaches great importance to the development of marine remote sensing and monitoring technology. The ocean remote sensing systems with complementary vantages offer significant economic and social benefits. HY-1A/B data have been widely used in sea surface temperature forecasting, sea ice operational monitoring in winter, red tide and green tide monitoring in summer, dynamic monitoring of coastal zones, coastal water quality monitoring, and fishery remote sensing. The HY-2A satellite fills the gaps of ocean dynamic environment satellite remote sensing and is the world's only in-orbit comprehensive ocean dynamic environment satellite that carries active and passive microwave remote sensors. HY-2A can simultaneously obtain data on sea-surface wind field, significant wave height, sea surface height, and sea surface temperature. The effectiveness of ocean environment monitoring and catastrophic sea condition forecasting has been improved with the use of satellite data. Ocean satellites provide reliable remote sensing data to the national economy and defense construction, marine scientific research, and global change research. They also play an important role in the international Earth observation system and are highly recognized by domestic and foreign users.HY-1 and HY-2 series satellites lay a solid foundation for the establishment of a sound ocean environment stereo monitoring system in China. With national development and the implementation of ""the Belt and Road"" strategy in China, the construction of maritime power, the safeguarding of marine rights and interests, and the development of marine economy demand high requirements and emphasize the urgent need for ocean remote sensing. Therefore, the ""Long-term Development Plan of Civil Space Infrastructure (2015-2025)"" is focused on the national maritime power strategy and establishes the plan for the ocean satellite series. This development plan is aimed at supporting the areas of marine resource survey, environment protection, disaster prevention and reduction, rights and interests safeguarding, management of sea areas, island and coastal zone investigation, and the polar ocean expedition of China.

Leveraging Multimission Satellite Data For Spatiotemporally Coherent Cyanohab Monitoring,"Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) present a critical public health challenge for aquatic resource and public health managers. Satellite remote sensing is well-positioned to aid in the identification and mapping of cyanoHABs and their dynamics, giving freshwater resource managers a tool for both rapid and long-term protection of public health. Monitoring cyanoHABs in lakes and reservoirs with remote sensing requires robust processing techniques for generating accurate and consistent products across local and global scales at high revisit rates. We leveraged the high spatial and temporal resolution chlorophyll-a (Chla) and phycocyanin (PC) maps from two multispectral satellite sensors, the Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Sentinel-3 (S3) Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) respectively, to study bloom dynamics in Utah Lake, United States, for 2018. We used established Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to map Chla from MSI and train new MDNs for PC retrieval from OLCI, using the same architecture and training dataset previously proven for PC retrieval from hyperspectral imagery. Our assessment suggests lower median uncertainties and biases (i.e., 42\% and -4\%, respectively) than that of existing top-performing PC algorithms. Additionally, we compared bloom trends in MDN-based PC and Chla products to those from a satellite-derived cyanobacteria cell density estimator, the cyanobacteria index (CI-cyano), to evaluate their utility in the context of public health risk management. Our comprehensive analyses indicate increased spatiotemporal coherence of bloom magnitude, frequency, occurrence, and extent of MDN-based maps compared to CI-cyano and potential for use in cyanoHAB monitoring for public health and aquatic resource managers.",NA,NA,10.3389/frsen.2023.1157609,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Global Path Planning Of Unmanned Vehicle Based On Fusion Of A* Algorithm And Voronoi Field,"Purpose: Since many global path planning algorithms cannot achieve the planned path with both safety and economy, this study aims to propose a path planning method for unmanned vehicles with a controllable distance from obstacles. Design/methodology/approach: First, combining satellite image and the Voronoi field algorithm (VFA) generates rasterized environmental information and establishes navigation area boundary. Second, establishing a hazard function associated with navigation area boundary improves the evaluation function of the A* algorithm and uses the improved A* algorithm for global path planning. Finally, to reduce the number of redundant nodes in the planned path and smooth the path, node optimization and gradient descent method (GDM) are used. Then, a continuous smooth path that meets the actual navigation requirements of unmanned vehicle is obtained. Findings: The simulation experiment proved that the proposed global path planning method can realize the control of the distance between the planned path and the obstacle by setting different navigation area boundaries. The node reduction rate is between 33.52% and 73.15%, and the smoothness meets the navigation requirements. This method is reasonable and effective in the global path planning process of unmanned vehicle and can provide reference to unmanned vehiclesâ autonomous obstacle avoidance decision-making. Originality/value: This study establishes navigation area boundary for the environment based on the VFA and uses the improved A* algorithm to generate a navigation path that takes into account both safety and economy. This study also proposes a method to solve the redundancy of grid environment path nodes and large-angle steering and to smooth the path to improve the applicability of the proposed global path planning method. The proposed global path planning method solves the requirements of path safety and smoothness.

"Flood Mapping Tools For Disaster Preparedness And Emergency Response Using Satellite Data And Hydrodynamic Models: A Case Study Of Bagmathi Basin, India","Northern Bihar is one of the major flood prone region in India affecting thousands of human lives and livelihoods during the recurrent floods occurring due to the monsoonal rains. While it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of extreme flood events, disaster planning can help in mitigating its detrimental effects. Monitoring flood extent using satellite observations just after the flood disasters is a core component of rapid emergency response process, which enables the emergency rescue teams to prioritize their efforts in critical areas to save lives and protect health, in addition to providing near real-time flooding information to the decision makers and planners. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of less data intensive, but equally robust hydrodynamic models to develop flood extent maps in conjunction with freely available remote sensing imageries at different scales. MODIS TERRA satellite data was used to map flood extent from 2001 to 2016 for entire Bihar. Two hydraulic models namely FLDPLN and RRI applied for the Bagmathi basin to evaluate our objectives. Both these models are of varying complexity but generate flood extent patterns with minimum amount of input data. The proposed approach is suited for mapping flood extents to provide an input information in near real time (h) when there is no availability to detailed hydraulic models and satellite datasets. Flood inundation extents from FLDPLN and RRI models were validated with Landsat-7 and MODIS TERRA derived flood extents for model performance. The results show acceptable spatial agreement between model predicted and Landsat-7 observed flood extents, denoting the utility of these tools for flood mapping application in data scarce environments.",NA,NA,10.1007/s40010-017-0461-7,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Combining Satellite-Derived Pm2.5 Data And A Reduced-Form Air Quality Model To Support Air Quality Analysis In Us Cities,"Air quality models can support pollution mitigation design by simulating policy scenarios and conducting source contribution analyses. The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is a powerful tool for equitable policy design as its variable resolution grid enables intra-urban analysis, the scale of which most environmental justice inquiries are levied. However, InMAP underestimates particulate sulfate and overestimates particulate ammonium formation, errors that limit the model's relevance to city-scale decision-making. To reduce InMAP's biases and increase its relevancy for urban-scale analysis, we calculate and apply scaling factors (SFs) based on observational data and advanced models. We consider both satellite-derived speciated PM2.5 from Washington University and ground-level monitor measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, applied with different scaling methodologies. Relative to ground-monitor data, the unscaled InMAP model fails to meet a normalized mean bias performance goal of <+/- 10\% for most of the PM2.5 components it simulates (pSO(4): -48\%, pNO(3): 8\%, pNH(4): 69\%), but with city-specific SFs it achieves the goal benchmarks for every particulate species. Similarly, the normalized mean error performance goal of <35\% is not met with the unscaled InMAP model (pSO(4): 53\%, pNO(3): 52\%, pNH(4): 80\%) but is met with the city-scaling approach (15\%-27\%). The city-specific scaling method also improves the R-2 value from 0.11 to 0.59 (ranging across particulate species) to the range of 0.36-0.76. Scaling increases the percent pollution contribution of electric generating units (EGUs) (nationwide 4\%) and non-EGU point sources (nationwide 6\%) and decreases the agriculture sector's contribution (nationwide -6\%).Plain Language Summary Air quality models can support the design of pollution reduction strategies by assessing sources of pollution and simulating policy scenarios. The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is an air quality model that can evaluate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) differences within cities, which makes it valuable as tool to assess equity of PM2.5 exposure. However, InMAP's simplified atmospheric chemistry equations results in errors that limit the model's relevance to city-scale decision-making. To reduce the model's biases and errors, we calculate and apply SFs based on observational data and advanced models, specifically ground-level monitor measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a satellite-derived data product. We find that applying SFs derived from satellite observations over cities or individual grid-cells improves model performance. Scaling InMAP affects the source contribution analysis nationwide and for individual cities, specifically by increasing the contribution of power plants and industry and decreasing the contribution of the agriculture sector.",NA,NA,10.1029/2023gh000788,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Applying Optimization Technology In Reservoir Management,"This paper presents the application of optimization techniques in reservoir management to determine the best development plan that maximizes the economic performance of an asset. A distinguishing characteristic of this approach is that it can evaluate all feasible scenarios for a specific financial objective within a set of well-defined constraints. The output of this integrated workflow is a complete set of decisions that drive capital investment, development scheduling, production, hydrocarbon recovery, and, ultimately, economic performance of the asset. The conventional approach to reservoir manage ment often considers a limited number of development options because of the complexity of the events within an investment plan and the time required for the evaluation. Input into the decision-making process traditionally comes in the form of sensitivity analyses from reservoir simulation, cost engineering, wellbore planning, pipeline networking, and project economic-analysis tools. These technologies are used to simulate performance by examining a specific development scenario, calculating future production, and performing a discounted cash-flow analysis to assess the return on the required investment. The exact scheduling of n ew infrastructure and production facilities as well as the drilling and stimulation of additional wells is critical to maximizing economic performance, especially if remaining reserves are material in size. These discrete events sometimes receive little attention. While the industry's ability to predict asset performance and assimilate several diverse perspectives together has significantly advanced, many reservoir-management decisions still are based on heuristics, rules of thumb, analogs to other assets, and ease of execution. Use of optimization techniques is not new in the energy busi ness. However, in reservoir management, the technology must cope with more nonlinear phenomena within the physical system, complex and realistic objective functions and constraints, and discrete decisions that occur at distinct points over the asset life. The use of mixed-integer nonlinear programming algorithms can be useful in these situations. These algorithms implicitly construct a tree of all possible development plans and then efficiently prune the branches to eliminate candidates that can be shown to be nonoptimal. The effectiveness of optimization technology is illustrated by applying it to the ongoing expansion of a regional complex of gas reservoirs. The approach is used to determine the development schedule of the different reservoirs and the timing of their wells, the timing and staging of compression, and the development of satellites to meet a contract specification. The results demonstrate four cornerstones of reservoir management that are key to maximizing economic performance: ordering - the schedule of events in the development schedule; integraton - coupled consideration of the total physical system; objective - the appropriate choice of a performance metric; and decision making - determining the developement plan that maximizes value.

"Land Use Land Cover Mapping Using Advanced Machine Learning Classifiers: A Case Study Of Shiraz City, Iran","Due to the recent climate changes and their consequences such as flash floods and droughts, there is a need for Land Use Land Cover mapping to monitor environmental changes which have effects on ecology, policy management, health, and disaster management. It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by climate change, and on the other hand, population growth has increased the rate of urbanization in Iran, where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for LULC mapping as well. The FDMLP classifier has outperformed the other two well-known algorithms of the SVM and the CTree for the classification of the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery and the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m in terms of the overall accuracy and index of kappa. Based on the test data, the DNN classifier for the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m with values of 91.28 and 88.57 percent for the OA and Kappa index has outperformed the other supervised classifiers.

A Generic Remote Sensing Approach To Derive Operational Essential Biodiversity Variables (Ebvs) For Conservation Planning,"1. The open access availability of satellite images from new sensors characterized by various spatial and temporal resolutions provides new challenges and possibilities for biodiversity conservation. Methodologies aiming at characterizing vegetation type, phenology, and function can now benefit from metric spatial resolution imagery combined with an improved revisit capability. Here, we test hybrid methods and data fusion, using very high spatial resolution (VHSR) sensors in different complex landscapes encompassing three French biogeographical regions. 2. The methodological approach presented herein has a generic value in response to national conservation targets based on the concept of essential biodiversity variables accessed by remote sensing (RS-enabled EBVs). We focused on deriving five RS-enabled EBVs from natural and seminatural open ecosystems: (1) ecosystem distribution, (2) land cover, (3) heterogeneity, (4) primary productivity and (5) vegetation phenology. The challenge was to develop a method that would be technically feasible, economically viable, and sustainable in time. 3. We demonstrated that it is possible to derive key parameters required to develop a set of EBVs from remote sensing (RS) data. The combined use of remote sensing data sources with various spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions is essential to obtain different indicators of natural habitats. 4. One major current challenge for an improved contribution of RS to conservation is to strengthen multiple collaborative frameworks among remote sensing scientists, conservation biologists, and ecologists in order to increase the efficiency of methodological exchange and draw benefits for successful conservation planning strategies.",NA,NA,10.1111/2041-210x.13033,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Higher Levels Of No-Till Agriculture Associated With Lower Pm2.5 In The Corn Belt,"No-till approaches to agricultural soil management have been encouraged as a means of reducing soil erosion, reducing water pollution, and increasing carbon sequestration. An understudied additional benefit of no-till approaches may be improvements in local air quality. No-till approaches involve reductions in both machinery use and soil erosion, both of which could lead to improvements in air quality. We leverage recent advances in remote sensing and air pollution modelling to examine this question at a landscape scale. Combining data on daily PM2.5 levels with satellite measures of no-till uptake since 2005, we show a strong association between increasing adoption of no-till and reductions in county average PM2.5 pollution over more than 28 million hectares of cropland in the American Corn Belt. The reduction in local pollution implies substantial monetary benefits from reductions in mortality that are roughly one-fourth as large as the estimated carbon benefits. The benefits of mortality reductions are also, by themselves, nearly equal to the current monetary costs of subsidizing no-till practices.",NA,NA,10.1088/1748-9326/ac816f,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Benefits Of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing For Tracking Plant Invasions,"Aim We aim to report what hyperspectral remote sensing can offer for invasion ecologists and review recent progress made in plant invasion research using hyperspectral remote sensing. Location United States. Methods We review the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing for detecting, mapping and predicting the spatial spread of invasive species. We cover a range of topics including the trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions and classification accuracy, the benefits of using time series to incorporate phenology in mapping species distribution, the potential of biochemical and physiological properties in hyperspectral spectral reflectance for tracking ecosystem changes caused by invasions, and the capacity of hyperspectral data as a valuable input for quantitative models developed for assessing the future spread of invasive species. Results Hyperspectral remote sensing holds great promise for invasion research. Spectral information provided by hyperspectral sensors can detect invaders at the species level across a range of community and ecosystem types. Furthermore, hyperspectral data can be used to assess habitat suitability and model the future spread of invasive species, thus providing timely information for invasion risk analysis.

Furthermore, information on the spatial distribution of invasive species can help land managers to make long-term constructive conservation plans for protecting and maintaining natural ecosystems.",NA,NA,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00761.x,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Gis And Optimisation: Potential Benefits For Emergency Facility Location In Humanitarian Logistics,"Floods are one of the most dangerous and common disasters worldwide, and these disasters are closely linked to the geography of the affected area. As a result, several papers in the academic field of humanitarian logistics have incorporated the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for disaster management. However, most of the contributions in the literature are using these systems for network analysis and display, with just a few papers exploiting the capabilities of GIS to improve planning and preparedness. To show the capabilities of GIS for disaster management, this paper uses raster GIS to analyse potential flooding scenarios and provide input to an optimisation model. The combination is applied to two real-world floods in Mexico to evaluate the value of incorporating GIS for disaster planning. The results provide evidence that including GIS analysis for a decision-making tool in disaster management can improve the outcome of disaster operations by reducing the number of facilities used at risk of flooding.

Improved U-Net Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation Method,"Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images by deep neural network is an important content of remote sensing intelligent interpretation, which plays a very important role in urban planning, disaster assessment, agricultural production and other fields. High resolution remote sensing images are characterized by complex background, diverse scales and irregular shape, etc. Therefore, using natural scene semantic segmentation methods to process remote sensing images often has the problem of low segmentation accuracy. Based on the U-Net model, a multi-scale skip connection method is proposed to integrate semantic features of different levels and obtain accurate segmentation boundary and location information. Attention mechanism and pyramid pooling are introduced to solve the problem of fine segmentation in complex background. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the WHDLD and LandCover.ai dataset and compared with the mainstream semantic segmentation methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other comparison methods, with mloU reaching 74.28% and 82.04% respectively, and with average of Fi score reaching 84.47% and 89.76% respectively; compared with the segmentation results of U-Net, the value of loU improves significantly in buildings, roads and other categories with a relatively small proportion, and is superior to other comparison methods.

Implementing Remote Sensing Strategies To Support Environmental Compliance Assessment: A Neural Network Application,"Environmental compliance assessment and enforcement are complex, labor intensive tasks that would benefit from some form of decision support. Despite the well-documented application of remote sensing in environmental analysis and assessment, the operational use of this technology for environmental compliance enforcement remains in its infancy. Because the majority of environmental laws and regulations in the United States were enacted prior to the emergence of a mature science of remote sensing, there exists a degree of skepticism regarding the operational utility and reliability of remotely sensed data as an environmental compliance tool. This paper provides a review of the role of remote sensing in environmental compliance assessment and introduces a framework to guide the application of this technology based on the use of artificial neural networks. The customized neural networks developed in this study serve as a simplifying strategy to assist the process of compliance monitoring.

Optimizing Invasive Species Management Using Mathematical Programming To Support Stewardship Of Water And Carbon-Based Ecosystem Services,"Invasive species alter hydrologic processes at watershed scales, with impacts to biodiversity and the supporting ecosystem services. This effect is aggravated by climate change. Here, we integrated modelled hydrologic data, remote sensing products, climate data, and linear mixed integer optimization (MIP) to identify stewardship actions across space and time that can reduce the impact of invasive species. The study area is the windward coast of Hawai'i Island (USA) across which non-native strawberry guava occurrence varies from extremely dense stands in lower watershed reaches, to low densities in upper watershed forests. We focused on the removal of strawberry guava, an invader that exerts significant impacts on watershed condition. MIP analyses spatially optimized the assignment of effective management actions to increase water yield, generate revenue from enhanced freshwater services, and income from removed biomass. The hydrological benefit of removing guava, often marginal when considered in isolation, was financially quantified, and single- and multiobjective MIP formulations were then developed over a 10-year planning horizon. Optimization resulted in \$2.27 million USD benefit over the planning horizon using a payment-for-ecosystem-services scheme. That value jumped to \$4.67 million when allowing work schedules with overnight camping to reduce costs. Pareto frontiers of weighted pairs of management goals showed the benefit of clustering treatments over space and time to improve financial efficiency.

Economic Benefit And Ecological Cost Of Enlarging Tea Cultivation In Subtropical China: Characterizing The Trade-Off For Policy Implications,"Cash crop expansion has become a global land use issue in recent decades. While the enlarging cash crop cultivation brings promising profitability, it can impair the delivery of various ecosystem services, with a risk of threat to sustainability and human well being. In order to make well-informed land use policy decisions, it requires elaborate efforts to characterize the trade-off between the benefit and cost of cash crop cultivation. This paper focuses on the enlarging tea cultivation in subtropical China, using a case of Anji County. We first monitor tea expansion from 1985 to 2016 based on time-series Landsat imageries, and then analyze the subsequent changes of water conservation service through an in-field survey of soil loss. Monetary approach is finally employed to evaluate the trade-off between economic benefit and ecological cost associated with the growing age of tea plantations. Results show that tea plantations expanded rapidly from 1985 to 2016 in Anji County. Delivery of water conservation service has been significantly impaired by the conversion from natural forests to tea plantations, but it can be gradually improved during the long rotational life cycles of tea plantations. For a given plot (1 ha at moderate slope), in theory, the economic benefit and ecological cost exhibit opposite trend associated the growing age of tea plantations, and an equilibrium point is approximately achieved at the 12-year growing age. In reality, ecological cost exceeds the economic benefit throughout the study period in Anji County. More specifically, the net difference increases from 11575 Yuan in 1985-1469167 Yuan in 2016. It denotes that economic benefit fails to compromise the ecological cost of the enlarging tea cultivation in Anji County. Conflicting land use policies (ecological conservation vs cash cropping promotion) and 'household contract responsibility' system should account for the unbalanced relationship between economic benefit and ecological conservation. We finally propose four major options towards the win-win possibilities between economic gain and ecological conservation associated with tea cultivation.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.044,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"

It even enables identification of farms that consume more irrigation water than formally allocated. Finally, it provides a basis to assess the cost-effectiveness of various ways to reduce agricultural water consumption.

Satellite Irrigation Management Support With The Terrestrial Observation And Prediction System: A Framework For Integration Of Satellite And Surface Observations To Support Improvements In Agricultural Water Resource Management,"In California and other regions vulnerable to water shortages, satellite-derived estimates of key hydrologic fluxes can support agricultural producers and water managers in maximizing the benefits of available water supplies. The Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) project combines NASA's Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery, and surface sensor networks to map indicators of crop irrigation demand and develop information products to support irrigation management and other water use decisions. TOPS-SIMS provides the computing and data processing systems required to support automated, near real-time integration of observations from satellite and surface sensor networks, and generates data and information in formats that are convenient for agricultural producers, water managers, and other end users.

Extending Als-Based Mapping Of Forest Attributes With Medium Resolution Satellite And Environmental Data,"Airborne laser scanner (ALS) data are used to map a range of forest inventory attributes at operational scales. However, when wall-to-wall ALS coverage is cost prohibitive or logistically challenging, alternative approaches are needed for forest mapping. We evaluated an indirect approach for extending ALS-based maps of forest attributes using medium resolution satellite and environmental data. First, we developed ALS-based models and predicted a suite of forest attributes for a 950 km2 study area covered by wall-to-wall ALS data. Then, we used samples extracted from the ALS-based predictions to model and map these attributes with satellite and environmental data for an extended 5600 km2 area with similar forest and ecological conditions. All attributes were predicted well with the ALS data (R2 â¥ 0.83; RMSD% < 26). The satellite and environmental models developed using the ALS-based predictions resulted in increased correspondence between observed and predicted values by 13-49% and decreased prediction errors by 8-28% compared with models developed directly with the ground plots. Improvements were observed for both multiple regression and random forest models, and for the suite of forest attributes assessed. We concluded that the use of ALS-based predictions in this study improved the estimation of forest attributes beyond an approach linking ground plots directly to the satellite and environmental data.

Improving Spectrum Management For Satellite Communication Systems With Hunger Marketing,"Efficient spectrum management is an important issue in satellite communications due to the pervasive growth in wireless communications and the ever-increasing demand by bandwidth-hungry mobile applications. While various kinds of static and dynamic spectrum allocation schemes have been studied by satellite researchers, the issue of unpredictable user behavior, hence demand for bandwidth, remains one of the key challenges faced by the research community. In this letter, we introduce the hunger marketing strategy in satellite spectrum management in order to address the unpredictable user demands. When adopting hunger marketing, the system always maintain a certain level of spectrum supply shortage, thus stimulating the desire of users to plan and commit their bandwidth requirements in advance, hence making their behavior more predictable and benefiting satellite systems. Besides, in circumstances of multibeam satellite systems, when allocating bands to new satellite users, the issue of increase in inter-cell interference is also considered in this letter. Thus, a two-stage dynamic game model based on hunger marketing is proposed which aims to achieve an optimal balance between spectrum utilization and inter-cell interference.

The Complementary Value Of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing And Snow Covered Area Products For Snow Hydrological Modelling,"A combined snow modelling approach integrating remote sensing data, in-situ data, and an improved hydrological model is presented. Complementary information sources are evaluated in terms of its value for constraining the model parameters and to overcome limitations of individual data such as inadequate scale representation. The study site consists of the Upper Fagge river basin in the Austrian Alps featuring the Weisssee Snow Research Site. The available remote sensing datasets include Terra MODIS based medium resolution and Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A based high resolution fractional snow covered area maps. Recently, Sentinel-1 based wet snow covered area maps have become increasingly available. To the knowledge of the authors the first evaluation of their value for snow-hydrological modelling is presented. Besides conventional small footprint station data, in-situ time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE) of a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) having a footprint of several hectares is additionally used. For including these data the model now provides respective outputs such as fractional snow cover, wet/dry snow surface and SWE areal means equivalent to the CRNS sensor footprint. By means of 40,000 model runs the high complementary value of representative SWE data and remote sensing information was assessed with most promising results achieved by combining high resolution fractional snow covered area maps with CRNS-SWE data. Regarding mean SWE or mean snow covered area in the catchment the ensemble spreads are reduced by two thirds compared to the results of a benchmark simulation based only on runoff for model calibration. Wet snow covered area maps have a high potential for simulating SWE at Weisssee Snow Research Site but introduce additional uncertainties for runoff simulations likely caused by the uncertain detection of the snow covered area from Sentinel-1 backscatter.

The prototype is a co-development of two research institutes of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and is based on two components: the Earth Observation Center (EOC) Geoservice, which constitutes an infrastructure providing data storage and management capabilities, as well as an interface compliant with collaborative and web-based data access services, and the Environmental and Crisis Information Systems (UKIS), a framework for the implementation of geoscientific web applications.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs14071598,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used"",""Data is not valued""}"
Trade-Offs Between Economic Benefits And Environmental Impacts Of Vegetable Greenhouses Expansion In East China,"Greenhouse vegetable cultivation (GVC) has become a global issue in agricultural land use in recent years. While the use of GVC brings considerable economic profits, it has significant environmental impacts, with a risk of threat to sustainability. To make sound development and management strategies, it is necessary to characterize the trade-offs between the benefits and costs of GVC expansion. This study focuses on the expansion of GVC in East China, taking Xiaoshan County as a case study. Remote sensing techniques are used to detect the spatial patterns of GVC expansion from 2005 to 2015; then, field surveys and empirical models are employed to assess the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and plastic waste. Lastly, monetary analysis is used to evaluate the trade-offs between the environmental costs and economic gains caused by GVC expansion. The results show that GVC has expanded rapidly from 2005 to 2015 in Xiaoshan County. The GVC expansion has significantly increased GHG emissions and plastic waste from cultivated land. Both the economic benefits and environmental costs of GVC expansion show an increasing tendency throughout the study period. It denotes that economic benefits can compensate for environmental costs of GHG emissions and plastic waste brought by GVC, but the long-term damage to the quality and environmental conditions of cultivated land is still underestimated. We finally propose four major policy implications to achieve a win-win scenario between economic profitability and cultivated land protection associated with GVC.",NA,NA,10.1007/s11356-021-14601-2,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Returns On Investment In Watershed Conservation: Application Of A Best Practices Analytical Framework To The Rio Camboriu Water Producer Program, Santa Catarina, Brazil","Watershed management may have widespread potential to cost-effectively deliver hydrologic services. Mobilizing the needed investments requires credible assessments of how watershed conservation compares to conventional solutions on cost and effectiveness, utilizing an integrated analytical framework that links the bio-, litho-, hydro- and economic spheres and uses counterfactuals. We apply such a framework to a payment for watershed services (PWS) program in Camboriti, Santa Catarina State, Brazil, Using 1 m resolution satellite imagery, we assess recent land use and land cover (LULC) change and apply the Land Change Modeler tool to predict future LULC without the PWS program. We use current and predicted counterfactual LULC, site costs and a Soil and Water Assessment Tool model calibrated to the watershed to both target watershed interventions for sediment reduction and predict program impact on total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations at the municipal water intake the principal program objective. Using local water treatment and PWS program costs, we estimate the return on investment (ROI; benefit costs) of the program. Program ROl exceeds 1 for the municipal water utility in year 44, well within common drinking water infrastructure planning horizons. Because some program costs are borne by third parties, over that same period, for overall (social) program ROI to exceed I requires delivery of very modest flood and supply risk reduction and biodiversity co-benefits, making co-benefits crucial for social program justification. Transaction costs account for half of total program costs, a result of large investments in efficient targeting and program sustainability. Co-benefits justify increased cost sharing with other beneficiaries, which would increase ROl for the utility, demonstrating the sensitivity of the business case for watershed conservation to its broader social-economic case and the ability to forge institutional arrangements to internalize third-party benefits.

"Multi-Resolution, Object-Oriented Fuzzy Analysis Of Remote Sensing Data For Gis-Ready Information","Remote sensing from airborne and spaceborne platforms provides valuable data for mapping, environmental monitoring, disaster management and civil and military intelligence. However, to explore the full value of these data, the appropriate information has to be extracted and presented in standard format to import it into geo-information systems and thus allow efficient decision processes. The object-oriented approach can contribute to powerful automatic and semiautomatic analysis for most remote sensing applications. Synergetic use to pixel-based or statistical signal processing methods explores the rich information contents. Here, we explain principal strategies of object-oriented analysis, discuss how the combination with fuzzy methods allows implementing expert knowledge and describe a representative example for the proposed workflow from remote sensing imagery to GIS. The strategies are demonstrated using the first object-oriented image analysis software on the market, eCognition, which provides an appropriate link between remote sensing imagery and GIS.

Multi-Level Service Infrastructure For Geovisual Analytics In The Context Of Territorial Management,"The management of a territory is a complex process, involving a number of different operators, administrators and decision makers. Territory management requires accessing and processing a wide range of heterogeneous and multi-dimensional GI (GI). Within a typical scenario, the process involves departments at public administrations responsible for urban planning, environmental control, infrastructure planning and maintenance. Additionally units such as civil protection, fire brigades also play a vital role when dealing with emergencies. Data to be managed range from alphanumerical information, stored within enterprise-level databases, to satellite imagery, vector data and information coming from on-site sensors. It is acknowledged that creating an infrastructure capable to provide access to such a range of information requires, an integrated system approach, both from a technological and from a procedural point of view. This article illustrates the benefit of adopting a system approach which makes use of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) and 3D geobrowsers to provide an answer to the aforementioned shortcomings. To do so the article presents the client-server platform designed to support decision makers and experts from local or regional administrations in the process of managing their territory. The infrastructure developed allows a large number of concurrent applications to access geographical data in a fully interactive way, within a 3D environment, thus providing support to territorial and environmental management tasks. The work illustrates also the results of the application of the infrastructure within a real-life scenario, thus providing the chance to discuss of implications of adopting such an approach.",NA,NA,10.4018/jitsa.2010100204,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
The Impact Of A Shade Coffee Certification Program On Forest Conservation Using Remote Sensing And Household Data,"In recent years, shade coffee certification programs have attracted increasing attention from forest conservation and development organizations. The certification programs could be expected to promote forest conservation by providing a premium price to shade coffee producers. However, little is known about the significance of the conservation efforts generated by certification programs. In particular, the relationship between the impact of the certification and producer characteristics has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation and its relationship with the socioeconomic characteristics of the producers. Remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 was used to gauge the changes in forest area. Employing a probit model, we found that a forest coffee area being certified increased the probability of forest conservation by 193 percentage points relative to forest coffee areas lacking certification. We also found that although economically poor producers tended to engage in forest clearing, the forest coffee certification program had a significant impact on these producers. This result suggests that the certification program significantly affects the behaviors of economically poor producers and motivates these producers to conserve the forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Satellite Remote Sensing In Support Of An Integrated Ocean Observing System,"Earth observing satellites represent some of the most valued components of the international Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), both part of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In the United States, such satellites are a cornerstone of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), required to carry out advanced coastal and ocean research, and to implement and sustain sensible resource management policies based on science. Satellite imagery and satellite-derived data are required for mapping vital coastal and marine resources, improving maritime domain awareness, and to better understand the complexities of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice, biological, and social interactions. These data are critical to the strategic planning of in situ observing components and are critical to improving forecasting and numerical modeling. Specifically, there are several stakeholder communities that require periodic, frequent, and sustained synoptic observations. Of particular importance are indicators of ecosystem structure (habitat and species inventories), ecosystem states (health and change) and observations about physical and biogeochemical variables to support the operational and research communities, and industry sectors including mining, fisheries, and transportation. IOOS requires a strategy to coordinate the human capacity, and fund, advance, and maintain the infrastructure that provides improved remote sensing observations and support for the nation and the globe. A partnership between the private, government, and education sectors will enhance remote sensing support and product development for critical coastal and deep-water regions based on infrared, ocean color, and microwave satellite sensors. These partnerships need to include international research, government, and industry sectors in order to facilitate open data access, understanding of calibration and algorithm strategies, and fill gaps in coverage. Such partnerships will define the types of observations required to sustain vibrant coastal economies and to improve the health of our marine and coastal ecosystems. They are required to plan, fund, launch and operate the types of satellite sensors needed in the very near future to maintain continuity of observations.",NA,NA,10.1109/mgrs.2013.2289656,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Scalable Retrieval Of Similar Landscapes In Optical Satellite Imagery Using Unsupervised Representation Learning,"Global Earth observation is becoming increasingly important in understanding and addressing critical aspects of life on our planet, including environmental issues, natural disasters, sustainable development, and others. Finding similarities in landscapes may provide useful information regarding applying contiguous policies, by making similar decisions or learning from best practices for events and occurrences that previously occurred in similar landscapes in the past. However, current applications of similar landscape retrieval are limited by a moderate performance and the need for time-consuming and costly annotations. We propose splitting the similar landscape retrieval task into a set of smaller tasks that aim to identify individual concepts inherent to satellite images. Our approach relies on several models trained using unsupervised representation learning on Google Earth images to identify these concepts. We show the efficacy of matching individual concepts for retrieving landscape(s) similar to a user-selected satellite image of the geographical territory of the Republic of Cyprus. Our results demonstrate the benefits of breaking up the landscape similarity task into individual concepts closely related to remote sensing, instead of applying a single model targeting all underlying concepts.

Review On Applications Of Remote Sensing In Urban Flood Modeling,"Urban flooding is serious in China. More than 360 cities have suffered rainstorm floods from 2007 to 2013. Floods in Beijing, Guangzhou, Jinan, et al. have caused serious casualties. In recent years, sea-views in cities have repeated here and there, and rainstorm induced flood has gradually become a chronic illness in many large and medium-sized cities in China. Simulation model for floods is a key technology for urban flood control and land use planning, and play a crucial role in the construction of urban water conservancy projects and infrastructures such as urban drainage system and sponge city. With the continuous and rapid development of the economics and society, urban flood risk warning and management requires a higher demand on the efficiency and elaboration of flood simulation. Obviously, the degree of elaboration on flood simulation highly depends on the temporal and spatial resolution of the basic input data. Rainfall data with smaller time intervals will present more comprehensive rainfall characteristics and further reflect the characteristics of flood processes. Meanwhile, higher resolution terrain data can reflect subtle ground features of urban surface such as buildings, curbs, bridges, etc. By summarizing and analyzing the literature on the researches of hydrological modeling with the utilization of remote sensing data, the application of remote sensing data (including meteorological and hydrological data, and surface information based on remote sensing) in flood simulation is reviewed. Frequently used remote sensing data sources with relatively high precision such as LiDAR (light imaging, detection, and ranging), InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar), oblique photography and hyperspectral remote sensing as well as their applications are presented. Advanced technologies and methods (airborne LiDAR and UAV Oblique Photography) producing basic remote sensing information used in urban flood modeling are presented. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the extraction framework of the basic information of urban flood simulation based on remote sensing, and the prospect to apply remote sensing technology in urban flood simulation is also presented. It is pointed out that flood simulation will be more effective and refined with the support of massive multi-source data in the future. At the same time, rich data sources also bring the following challenges and opportunities: (1) Rapidly increasing amount of high-resolution remote sensing data poses greater challenges to data storage and management, while high-performance distributed storage technologies and data processing technologies can provide solutions for this objective. (2) Massive data and the relatively low processing and utilization capacity will cause a huge waste of resources. Based on data analysis methods such as machine learning and data assimilation, massive multi-source data will be integrated to form a comprehensive database for urban flood modeling, which can provide scientific and technological support for modern urban construction and management. (3) Urban flood simulation with high resolution is extremely computational intensive that the time consumption will exponentially increase. However, this is unacceptable for rapid and efficient urban flood forecasting and early warning. High-performance computing technology such as GPU-based parallelization on CUDA platform will greatly benefit for urban flood simulation. Â© 2018, Science Press.

Watershed Conservation In The Long Run,"We studied unanticipated long-run outcomes of conservation activities that occurred in forested watersheds on O'ahu, Hawaii, in the early twentieth century. The initial general impetus for the conservation activities was to improve irrigation surface water flow for the sugar industry. Industry concentration facilitated conservation of entire ecosystems. We investigate the benefits that accrued through dynamic linkages of the hydrological cycle and groundwater aquifer system. This provides a clear example of the need to consider integrated watershed effects, industrial structure, and linkages in determining conservation policy. We incorporated remote-sensing data, expert opinion on current watershed quality, and a spatial economic and hydrological model of O'ahu's freshwater use with reports of conservation activities from 1910-1960 to assess these benefits. We find a 2.3\% annual increase in groundwater recharge levels from these activities, with a lower bound benefit-cost ratio of 7.1-18.2. This lower-bound excludes returns from such high value, yet controversial to measure, amenities as species preservation.",NA,NA,10.1007/s10021-014-9754-8,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Enhancing Object Detection In Remote Sensing: A Hybrid Yolov7 And Transformer Approach With Automatic Model Selection,"In the remote sensing field, object detection holds immense value for applications such as land use classification, disaster monitoring, and infrastructure planning, where accurate and efficient identification of objects within images is essential for informed decision making. However, achieving object localization with high precision can be challenging even if minor errors exist at the pixel level, which can significantly impact the ground distance measurements. To address this critical challenge, our research introduces an innovative hybrid approach that combines the capabilities of the You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) and DEtection TRansformer (DETR) algorithms. By bridging the gap between local receptive field and global context, our approach not only enhances overall object detection accuracy, but also promotes precise object localization, a key requirement in the field of remote sensing. Furthermore, a key advantage of our approach is the introduction of an automatic selection module which serves as an intelligent decision-making component. This module optimizes the selection process between YOLOv7 and DETR, and further improves object detection accuracy. Finally, we validate the improved performance of our new hybrid approach through empirical experimentation, and thus confirm its contribution to the field of target recognition and detection in remote sensing images.

Ecological Compensation Estimation Of Soil And Water Conservation Based On Cost-Benefit Analysis,"Soil and water conservation ecological compensation can be simply defined as a monetary payment to offset the environmental loss. An illustration is given in this study describing the payment compensation to water resource conservation and soil losses in Erlongshan reservoir catchment, China. A semi-distributed hydrological SWAT model was applied to establish compensation standard considering six scenarios of land use changes by combined application of remote sensing and geographic information systems. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) method is applied to evaluate the function of soil and water conservation, of which marginal opportunity cost and market value methods have been explored calculate the cost and benefit of water and soil conservation ecological function from provider and beneficiaries. Finally the ecological compensation of soil and water conservation for different land-use scenarios is calculated incorporating benefit apportion coefficient.

Impact Of Insolation Data Source On Remote Sensing Retrievals Of Evapotranspiration Over The California Delta,"The energy delivered to the land surface via insolation is a primary driver of evapotranspiration (ET)the exchange of water vapor between the land and atmosphere. Spatially distributed ET products are in great demand in the water resource management community for real-time operations and sustainable water use planning. The accuracy and deliverability of these products are determined in part by the characteristics and quality of the insolation data sources used as input to the ET models. This paper investigates the practical utility of three different insolation datasets within the context of a satellite-based remote sensing framework for mapping ET at high spatiotemporal resolution, in an application over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in California. The datasets tested included one reanalysis product: The Climate System Forecast Reanalysis (CFSR) at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, and two remote sensing insolation products generated with geostationary satellite imagery: a product for the continental United States at 0.2 degrees, developed by the University of Wisconsin Space Sciences and Engineering Center (SSEC) and a coarser resolution (1 degrees) global Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. The three insolation data sources were compared to pyranometer data collected at flux towers within the Delta region to establish relative accuracy. The satellite products significantly outperformed CFSR, with root-mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.7, 1.5, and 1.4 MJm(-2)d(-1) for CFSR, CERES, and SSEC, respectively, at daily timesteps. The satellite-based products provided more accurate estimates of cloud occurrence and radiation transmission, while the reanalysis tended to underestimate solar radiation under cloudy-sky conditions. However, this difference in insolation performance did not translate into comparable improvement in the ET retrieval accuracy, where the RMSE in daily ET was 0.98 and 0.94 mm d(-1) using the CFSR and SSEC insolation data sources, respectively, for all the flux sites combined. The lack of a notable impact on the aggregate ET performance may be due in part to the predominantly clear-sky conditions prevalent in central California, under which the reanalysis and satellite-based insolation data sources have comparable accuracy. While satellite-based insolation data could improve ET retrieval in more humid regions with greater cloud-cover frequency, over the California Delta and climatologically similar regions in the western U.S., the CFSR data may suffice for real-time ET modeling efforts.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs11030216,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Delay-Packet-Loss-Optimized Distributed Routing Using Spiking Neural Network In Delay-Tolerant Networking,"Satellite communication is inevitable due to the Internet of Everything and the exponential increase in the usage of smart devices. Satellites have been used in many applications to make human life safe, secure, sophisticated, and more productive. The applications that benefit from satellite communication are Earth observation (EO), military missions, disaster management, and 5G/6G integration, to name a few. These applications rely on the timely and accurate delivery of space data to ground stations. However, the channels between satellites and ground stations suffer attenuation caused by uncertain weather conditions and long delays due to line-of-sight constraints, congestion, and physical distance. Though inter-satellite links (ISLs) and inter-orbital links (IOLs) create multiple paths between satellite nodes, both ISLs and IOLs have the same issues. Some essential applications, such as EO, depend on time-sensitive and error-free data delivery, which needs better throughput connections. It is challenging to route space data to ground stations with better QoS by leveraging the ISLs and IOLs. Routing approaches that use the shortest path to optimize latency may cause packet losses and reduced throughput based on the channel conditions, while routing methods that try to avoid packet losses may end up delivering data with long delays. Existing routing algorithms that use multi-optimization goals tend to use priority-based optimization to optimize either of the metrics. However, critical satellite missions that depend on high-throughput and low-latency data delivery need routing approaches that optimize both metrics concurrently. We used a modified version of Kleinrock's power metric to reduce delay and packet losses and verified it with experimental evaluations. We used a cognitive space routing approach, which uses a reinforcement-learning-based spiking neural network to implement routing strategies in NASA's High Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) project.",NA,NA,10.3390/s23010310,"{""sat comms""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Comprehensive Cost-Benefit Evaluation Of The Hulunbuir Grassland Meadow Ecological Function Area,"The cost-benefit evaluation of ecological engineering is an assessment of the effectiveness and rationality of ecological engineering implementation.

The results showed that; (1) From 2010 to 2014, the total investment in the relevant fields of HGMEFA construction was 84.31 hundred million yuan, while the construction cost of the HGMEFA was 1.18 hundred million yuan, accounting for 1.40% of the total investment; (2) The contribution rate of ecological construction was 37.25%, and the ecological benefit of HGMEFA construction from 2011 to 2015 was 1.25 hundred million yuan; (3) The economic and social benefits of HGMEFA construction from 2011 to 2015 were 0.49 hundred million yuan and 0.28 hundred million yuan, respectively; (4) The engineering construction benefit-cost ratio of the HGMEFA was 1.71, with benefits higher than the investments, thereby proving that the project was economical.

Impact Of Subsystem Reliability On Satellite Revenue Generation And Present Value,"A new framework is developed that analytically links an engineering concept, a system's reliability, with both managerial and financial concepts, the system's revenue generation capability, and its present value. A communications satellite is used as an example to illustrate the use and insights that can be generated from this framework. For instance., after the development of a revenue model for a communications satellite, the cost of unreliability was quantified: the present value penalty for the lack of 100\% payload reliability. Next, the value of redundancy was also analytically captured: the satellite incremental present value provided by payload redundancy. The central finding is that present value calculations of a technical revenue-generating system, in this instance, a communications satellite, that do not account for system's reliability overestimate the system's present value and, thus, can lead to flawed investment decisions. Finally, when sensitivity analysis is performed on the various drivers of the satellite present value, it was found, against conventional wisdom, that redundancy in communications satellite payload is overrated; in other words, that increasing payload redundancy provides limited incremental value to the spacecraft.",NA,NA,10.2514/1.13137,"{""comms satellite""}",excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Risk Preferences Over Health: Empirical Estimates And Implications For Medical Decision-Making,"Mainstream health economic theory implies that an expected gain in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) produces the same value for consumers, regardless of baseline health. Several strands of recent research call this implication into question. Generalized Risk-Adjusted Cost-Effectiveness (GRACE) demonstrates theoretically that baseline health status influences value, so long as consumers are not risk-neutral over health. Prior empirical literature casts doubt on risk-neutral expected utility-maximization in the health domain. We estimate utility over HRQoL in a nationally representative U.S. population and use our estimates to measure risk preferences over health. We find that individuals are risk-seeking at low levels of health, become risk-averse at health equal to 0.485 (measured on a 0â1 scale), and are most risk-averse at perfect health (coefficient of relative risk aversion = 4.51). We develop the resulting implications for medical decision making, cost-effectiveness analyses, and the proper theory of health-related decision making under uncertainty.

A Review Of The Role Of Active Remote Sensing And Data Fusion For Characterizing Forest In Wildlife Habitat Models,"Spatially explicit maps of wildlife habitat relationships have proven to be valuable tools for conservation and management applications including evaluating how and which species may be impacted by large scale climate change, ongoing fragmentation of habitat, and local land-use practices. Studies have turned to remote sensing datasets as a way to characterize vegetation for the examination of habitat selection and for mapping realized relationships across the landscape. Potentially one of the more difficult habitat types to try to characterize with remote sensing are the vertically and horizontally complex forest systems. Characterizing this complexity is needed to explore which aspects may represent driving and/or limiting factors for wildlife species. Active remote sensing data from lidar and radar sensors has thus caught the attention of the forest wildlife research and management community in its potential to represent three dimensional habitat features. The purpose of this review was to examine the applications of active remote sensing for characterizing forest in wildlife habitat studies through a keyword search within Web of Science. We present commonly used active remote sensing metrics and methods, discuss recent advances in characterizing aspects of forest habitat, and provide suggestions for future research in the area of new remote sensing data/techniques that could benefit forest wildlife studies that are currently not represented or may be underutilized within the wildlife literature. We also highlight the potential value in data fusion of active and passive sensor data for representing multiple dimensions and scales of forest habitat. While the use of remote sensing has increased in recent years within wildlife habitat studies, continued communication between the remote sensing, forest management, and wildlife communities is vital to ensure appropriate data sources and methods are understood and utilized, and so that creators of mapping products may better realize the needs of secondary users.",NA,NA,10.4995/raet.2016.3981,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Cost-Effective Forest Conservation And Criteria For Potential Conservation Targets:: A Finnish Case Study,"Selecting reserves for forest biodiversity maintenance is often done by setting criteria for components of structural elements of biodiversity, such as a volume of decaying wood. we tested how the different threshold values for the components of structural elements affect the cost-effective site selection. Using Finnish National Forest Inventory information and remote sensing data, we determined a habitat quality index and economic value for each site in Satakunta region in Finland. Moreover, we defined several sets of potential conservation targets using alternative criteria for the habitat quality index developed for the Finnish case study. These figures were used in the site selection model in order to maximize the sum of habitat index of selected areas under a given budget constraint. We found that the production possibility frontier for the outputs of timber and biodiversity is only slightly concave when using the given threshold values. Thus, the optimal combination of the outputs is sensitive to the relative values of these goods. Our results suggest that an integrated approach in forest conservation could provide to environmental managers considerable cost savings compared with current management practices. Environmental managers could also reduce conservation costs by loosening the criteria for potential conservation targets. This would not lower considerably the quality of conserved forests.

Research Progress Of Soil Moisture Estimation Based On Microwave Remote Sensing,"Soil moisture is an important link for the exchange of water and heat processes between the surface and the atmosphere, and is of great significance to agricultural production, ecological planning, and water resources management. Microwave remote sensing has the advantages of not being affected by weather conditions and being able to better detect the soil information and trend of soil moisture change under vegetation coverage. Thus, it is a hot spot for accurate soil moisture retrieval by remote sensing. With the gradual increase in the number of Earth observation satellites, microwave detectors have developed from C-band to L-band, and soil moisture datasets have become more and more abundant. In this paper, the existing global-scale soil moisture products based on microwave remote sensing are summarized. It also analyzes and compares the principle, characteristics, application scope and key technological progress of active microwave remote sensing, passive microwave remote sensing, and active and passive microwave fusion in soil moisture retrieval. The advantage of active microwave remote sensing and passive microwave remote sensing is high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, respectively. High spatial resolution can capture the subtle spatial information features of the surface, but it is limited by the complex relationship between soil moisture and backscattering coefficients, especially the interference of vegetation and surface roughness on the radar backscattering coefficient making retrieval of soil moisture inaccurate. Therefore, selecting different scattering models according to the actual situation and using multi-source data synergy are the current research hotspots to improve accuracy. This paper summarizes the active microwave soil moisture retrieval method into three types: mechanism model, empirical model and semi-empirical model according to the principle. We also considered the applicability and shortcomings at the same time. For instance, high temporal resolution can achieve global and large-scale soil moisture monitoring, but it is difficult to meet the actual research needs of small-scale or small-scale areas. In order to better match the measured data in space, four downscaling methods based on the geostatistical method, mathematical statistics method, data assimilation method and multi-source remote sensing data fusion method are proposed. Combining the advantages and disadvantages of the above two microwave remote sensing methods, researchers can rely on more abundant data sources and relatively mature observation technology to fuse and extract more moisture information and to improve the retrieval accuracy or obtain long-term series data. However, this method often has the problem of missing data due to factors such as revisit time, seasonal ice period or radio frequency interference, which has a great impact on the spatiotemporal continuity of the data. So, the interpolation methods based on time, space, and statistics have been employed to solve the missing value issues. In the current method, soil moisture retrieval shows good performance at small scales, but at the global scale, there will be many problems such as missing data, poor applicability, low retrieval accuracy, and too complicated retrieval processes. Improvements can be made by employing multiple observation methods (multi-polarization, multi-angle, multi-band), multi-temporal repeated observation, the introduction of new algorithms on the original model and data assimilation. The rapid development of long-term stable and high spatiotemporal resolution L-band microwave signals in the field of land remote sensing of Global Navigation Satellite System also provides a reference for the development of China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, showing its huge application potential.

"Technical Note Remote Sensing And An Experimental Geographic Information System For Environmental Monitoring, Resource Planning And Management","A brief summary is presented of a study on Geographic Information Systems; a full report on the study is being published elsewhere. At present, the benefits of satellite remote sensing within the U.K. are largely potential rather than established. A continuing need exists to explore ways of widening the topics to which remote sensing can be applied and to demonstrate the values of remote sensing in enabling existing tasks to be undertaken even more efficiently and cost effectively. Planning, managing and monitoring natural and cultural resources require timely information, the capability to update this information regularly-if not frequently, and the need to interrelate different sets of information for wise and objective decision making. All are prime areas for testing the utility of remote sensing within the operating environment of a geographic information system (GIS).

Geospatial Big Data: New Paradigm Of Remote Sensing Applications,"The rapid development of information technology and location techniques not only leads to an increasing growth of massive geospatial big data but also raises the attention of using these data to complement with remote sensing images. Many efforts have been made to utilize geospatial big data to identify human activity patterns and carry out urban and environmental researches, integrating with remote sensing images. Nonetheless, there are still many issues, including the representativeness and locality of geospatial big data, as well as the fusion methods, remain to be further explored. In this article, we first reviewed the innovation and proceedings of data mining and analyzing techniques, as well as remote sensing applications driven by geospatial big data. Besides, two popular concepts, namely, ""Social Sensing"" and ""Urban Computing,"" were briefly introduced. Then, we highlighted the role of geospatial big data in mining human activity dynamics and socioeconomic characteristics, and the feasibility of combining with remote sensing data for various studies. Lastly, we presented some empirical case studies on the confluence of remote sensing and geospatial big data in land use extraction, environmental and disaster monitoring, as well as socioeconomic dynamics sensing. The provided examples and discussion demonstrated the high efficiency and complementarity of the integration of remote sensing and geospatial big data, which benefits decision making from multiple perspectives and scales.",NA,NA,10.1109/jstars.2019.2944952,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Remote Sensing Of Irrigated Agriculture: Opportunities And Challenges,"Over the last several decades, remote sensing has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. The objective of this review, which summarizes the methods and the results of existing remote sensing studies, is to synthesize principle findings and assess the state of the art. We take a taxonomic approach to group studies based on location, scale, inputs, and methods, in an effort to categorize different approaches within a logical framework. We seek to evaluate the ability of remote sensing to provide synoptic and timely coverage of irrigated lands in several spectral regions. We also investigate the value of archived data that enable comparison of images through time. This overview of the studies to date indicates that remote sensing-based monitoring of irrigation is at an intermediate stage of development at local scales. For instance, there is overwhelming consensus on the efficacy of vegetation indices in identifying irrigated fields. Also, single date imagery, acquired at peak growing season, may suffice to identify irrigated lands, although to multi-date image data are necessary for improved classification and to distinguish different crop types. At local scales, the mapping of irrigated lands with remote sensing is also strongly affected by the timing of image acquisition and the number of images used. At the regional and global scales, on the other hand, remote sensing has not been fully operational, as methods that work in one place and time are not necessarily transferable to other locations and periods. Thus, at larger scales, more work is required to indentify the best spectral indices, best time periods, and best classification methods under different climatological and cultural environments. Existing studies at regional scales also establish the fact that both remote sensing and national statistical approaches require further refinement with a substantial investment of time and resources for ground-truthing. An additional challenge in mapping irrigation across large areas occurs in fragmented landscapes with small irrigated and cultivated fields, where the spatial scale of observations is pitted against the need for high frequency temporal acquisitions. Finally, this review identifies passive and active microwave observations, advanced image classification methods, and data fusion including optical and radar sensors or with information from sources with multiple spatial and temporal characteristics as key areas where additional research is needed.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs2092274,{},excluded,"{""Review or opinion""}"
Identification Of Ecosystem Services In Forest Areas Through Remote Sensing,"The concept of ecosystem services has been used in decision-making processes and in the management of projects with the potential to cause significant environmental degradation, by explaining the dependence that society has on the benefits ofered by ecosystems. In parallel, with the development of new sensors and technological advances, the application of satellite imagery to environment planning and management has also been growing. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the application of remote sensing to identify ecosystems, their services and beneficiaries, is order to facilitate the application of the ecosystem services concept to environmental planning and management. The steps for application, from land cover mapping to the identification of beneficiaries were tested in a bauxite mine located in the Amazon forest. Two techniques - collecting field data with communities and mapping the area through image classification -, are discussed as providing complementary input. Results demonstrate the applicability of remote sensing as an effective tool to support the identification of ecosystem services for environmental planning and management purposes.

Residual Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method For Lithium-Ion Batteries In Satellite With Incomplete Healthy Historical Data,"Due to the strict requirements of satellite systems, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the key components is very important to the reliability and security of satellite systems. Otherwise, a failure could lead to catastrophic consequences and enormous economic losses. Because of the complex structure of the satellite and its complex space environment, the factors that affect the satellite systems status are numerous. Moreover, as a result of the healthy historical data of key components in satellite are too few, which makes the traditional methods based on analysis model are not suitable for RUL prediction of key components in satellite. In this paper, in order to solve the RUL prediction problem of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in satellite with incomplete healthy historical data, we propose an efficient RUL prediction method for key components of satellite, which is called Residual Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method (RRULPM), based on the study of Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET). The RRULPM is make up of degradation model based on MSET state estimation and criteria of failure based on historical degradation value, which is developed by improving MSET and combining the residuals with life cycle damage (LCD) prediction creatively when lacking healthy historical data. Experimental results demonstrate that the RRULPM is excellent to achieve the RUL prediction problems of LIBs through the actual in orbit telemetry data. Unlike previous RUL prediction methods, RRULPM provides good feasibility and effectiveness. This research can serve as guidance for prognostics and health management (PHM) of key components in satellite.",NA,NA,10.1109/access.2019.2938060,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
The Investment Opportunities In The Innovation-Led Listed Satellite And Telecommunication Infrastructure Sectors,"Purpose Communication infrastructure assets present a compelling investment opportunity for investors interested to tap into the technology-driven and innovation-led infrastructure segments, given the need for intensified capital deployment to prepare for the future substantial flow in volume and velocity of information. These communication infrastructure assets exist either in the segments of satellite or telecommunication infrastructure. This paper intends to empirically assess the performance attributes of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure over January 2000-June 2019. Sub-period performance dynamics of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure in the pre-GFC (January 2000-June 2007) and the post-GFC (July 2009-June 2019) investment horizons are provided. Design/methodology/approach Nineteen-year monthly total returns over 2000-2019 were used to analyse the risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification potential of both listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure. The mean-variance portfolio optimisation framework using the full period and post-GFC ex-post returns, risk and correlation coefficient of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure and other financial assets was developed to determine the added-value benefits of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure in an optimised investment framework. Findings Listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure delivered mixed investment performance. They were highly volatile and there was a significant discount in total return performance against the other asset classes in the full and pre-GFC periods. However, listed telecommunication infrastructure delivered stronger performance in the post-GFC period across all performance measures. Listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure offered strong diversification benefits for investors across all investment horizons. Further, the inclusion of listed telecommunication infrastructure in both the full period and post-GFC mixed-asset investment framework was also empirically justified. Practical implications - Communication infrastructure assets such as satellite and telecommunication infrastructure are the key infrastructure assets to ensure the seamless operation of and interaction with modern technology going forward. Whilst being a small proportion of the overall infrastructure asset class universe, the \$2.1 trillion progressively expanding listed communication infrastructure sector is having an important role to stimulate investor capital deployments in high quality and future-proof communication infrastructure assets. Listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure assets are an opportunistic investment given their future growth potential and are seen as a suitable fit for investors with a secular investment profile. Originality/value Despite the infrastructure asset class being the focus of growing attention and empirical analysis, no previous studies have empirically investigated the listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure sectors. This is the first published empirical research analysis that aims at articulating the investment attributes of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure as a route for exposure in technology-related infrastructure assets. This research validates and informs practical property investment decision-making for investors seeking exposure in the increasingly important communication infrastructure assets sector.",NA,NA,10.1108/jpif-10-2019-0132,{},excluded,"{""ESI data not used""}"
Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis As A Forest Management Priority Mapping Approach Based On Airborne Laser Scanning And Field Inventory Data,"The mapping of ecosystem service (ES) provisioning often lacks decision-makers' preferences on the ESs pro-vided. Analyzing the related uncertainties can be computationally demanding for a landscape tessellated to a large number of spatial units such as pixels. We propose stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses to incorporate (unknown or only partially known) decision-makers' preferences into the spatial forest management prioritization in a Scandinavian boreal forest landscape. The potential of the landscape for the management alternatives was quantified by airborne laser scanning based proxies. A nearest-neighbor imputation method was applied to provide each pixel with stochastic acceptabilities on the alternatives based on decision-makers' preferences sampled from a probability distribution. We showed that this workflow could be used to derive two types of maps for forest use prioritization: one showing the alternative that a decision-maker with given pref-erences should choose and another showing areas where the suitability of the forest structure suggested different alternative than the preferences. We discuss the potential of the latter approach for mapping management hotspots. The stochastic approach allows estimating the strength of the decision with respect to the uncertainty in both the proxy values and preferences. The nearest neighbor imputation of stochastic acceptabilities is a computationally feasible way to improve decisions based on ES proxy maps by accounting for uncertainties, although the need for such detailed information at the pixel level should be separately assessed.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104637,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
A Variational Merging Approach To The Spatial Description Of Environmental Variables,"High-resolution images of environmental variables are highly valuable sources of information in research and environmental management. Obtaining spatially continuous information from ground observations is challenging due to the wide variety of factors that affect classical interpolation methods. While geostatistical methods have produced noteworthy results, they generally rely on important assumptions and strongly depend on the availability of observed data. In turn, satellite-based or model-based gridded images generally represent the global spatial structure of environmental variables but are subject to bias. With the objective of exploiting the benefits of both sources of information, we propose a new mathematical formulation to merge observed data with gridded images of environmental variables using partial differential equations in a variational setting. With a convenient functional, formed as the sum of two competing terms, two simultaneous goals are achieved: to improve the description of the spatial structure in maps generated by simple deterministic interpolation methods and to increase the reliability of satellite-based or model-based images. Either satellite-based or model-based information is included in a regularity term to provide the global spatial structure, while in situ data are included in a fidelity term. The resulting maps can be considered a merging of interpolated in situ data with satellite or model imagery. The method is first evaluated using simulated images generated by geostatistical simulation and then applied to actual temperature and precipitation data in selected regions in the Tropical Andes. The results indicate that the method is capable of generating realistic maps while performing well in terms of validation.",NA,NA,10.1002/2017jd027982,{},excluded,{Validation/calibration}
Opportunity Costs Of Forest Conservation In Nepal,"Forest biomass may vary by species composition, location, management regimes, and management interventions. To assess the variation in biomass production by management regimes, we conducted a study in three physiographic regions (mid-hills, Siwaliks and Terai) of Nepal with four different management regimes (community forest, collaborative forest, protected area, and protected forest). As community forest is the dominant forest management regime in Nepal, it was studied in all physiographic regions whereas the other two regimes were drawn only from the Terai. We interviewed a total of 1,115 forest user households, which was supplemented by high-resolution satellite image analysis and forest inventory to estimate the costs and benefits of forest management and calculate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our estimates suggest that the opportunity cost of conserving forest in Nepal ranged from USD 654/ha in collaborative forest to USD 3,663/ha in protected forest in 2015. The associated opportunity cost of carbon sequestration was between USD 1.11 and USD 3.56 per tCO(2). Of the forest management practices adopted, the silviculture-based intensive forest management practice had a far lower cost of forest conservation compared to the other forest management regimes. We found that such a practice is more beneficial to the forest-dependent communities as it allows them to collect the non-timber forest products that are necessary for their daily needs.",NA,NA,10.3389/ffgc.2022.857145,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
"Spatial And Temporal Estimates Of Population Exposure To Wildfire Smoke During The Washington State 2012 Wildfire Season Using Blended Model, Satellite, And In Situ Data","In the western U.S., smoke from wild and prescribed fires can severely degrade air quality. Due to changes in climate and land management, wildfires have increased in frequency and severity, and this trend is expected to continue. Consequently, wildfires are expected to become an increasingly important source of air pollutants in the western U.S. Hence, there is a need to develop a quantitative understanding of wildfire-smoke-specific health effects. A necessary step in this process is to determine who was exposed to wildfire smoke, the concentration of the smoke during exposure, and the duration of the exposure. Three different tools have been used in past studies to assess exposure to wildfire smoke: in situ measurements, satellite-based observations, and chemical-transport model (CTM) simulations. Each of these exposure-estimation tools has associated strengths and weakness. We investigate the utility of blending these tools together to produce estimates of PM2.5 exposure from wildfire smoke during the Washington 2012 fire season. For blending, we use a ridge-regression model and a geographically weighted ridge-regression model. We evaluate the performance of the three individual exposure-estimate techniques and the two blended techniques by using leave-one-out cross validation. We find that predictions based on in situ monitors are more accurate for this particular fire season than the CTM simulations and satellite-based observations because of the large number of monitors present; therefore, blending provides only marginal improvements above the in situ observations. However, we show that in hypothetical cases with fewer surface monitors, the two blending techniques can produce substantial improvement over any of the individual tools.",NA,NA,10.1002/2017gh000049,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Development Of A Flash Flood Confidence Index From Disaster Reports And Geophysical Susceptibility,"The analysis of historical disaster events is a critical step towards understanding current risk levels and changes in disaster risk over time. Disaster databases are potentially useful tools for exploring trends, however, criteria for inclusion of events and for associated descriptive characteristics is not standardized. For example, some databases include only primary disaster types, such as 'flood', while others include subtypes, such as 'coastal flood' and 'flash flood'. Here we outline a method to identify candidate events for assignment of a specific disaster subtype-namely, 'flash floods'-from the corresponding primary disaster type-namely, 'flood'. Geophysical data, including variables derived from remote sensing, are integrated to develop an enhanced flash flood confidence index, consisting of both a flash flood confidence index based on text mining of disaster reports and a flash flood susceptibility index from remote sensing derived geophysical data. This method was applied to a historical flood event dataset covering Ecuador. Results indicate the potential value of disaggregating events labeled as a primary disaster type into events of a particular subtype. The outputs are potentially useful for disaster risk reduction and vulnerability assessment if appropriately evaluated for fitness of use.",NA,NA,10.3390/rs13142764,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Fusion Of Remote Sensing And Internet Data To Calculate Urban Floor Area Ratio,"The floor area ratio is a comprehensive index that plays an important role in urban planning and sustainable development. Remote sensing data are widely used in floor area ratio calculations because they can produce both two-dimensional planar and three-dimensional stereo information on buildings. However, remote sensing is not adequate for calculating the number of floors in a building. In this paper, a simple and practical pixel-level model is established through defining a quantitative relationship among the floor area ratio, building density, and average number of floors (ANF). The floor area ratios are calculated by combining remote sensing data with publicly available Internet data. It incorporates supplemental map data and street-level views from Internet maps to confirm building types and the number of floors, thereby enabling more-accurate floor area ratio calculations. The proposed method is tested in the Tiantongyuan neighborhood, Changping District, Beijing, and the results show that it can accurately approximate the number of floors in buildings. Inaccuracies in the value of the floor area ratio were found to be primarily due to the uncertainties in building density calculations. After performing systematic error correction, the building density (BD) and floor area ratio were each calculated with the relative accuracy exceeding 90\%. Moreover, the experiments verified that the fusion of internet map data with remote sensing data has innate advantages for floor area ratio calculations.",NA,NA,10.3390/su11123382,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued"",Validation/calibration}"
Simple Spatial Modeling Tool For Prioritizing Prescribed Burning Activities At The Landscape Scale,"Resources for prescribed fire are frequently insufficient to manage public lands for all conservation and resource management objectives, necessitating prioritization of the application of fire across the landscape within any given year. Defining tradeoffs when applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U. S. A.) to prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting, managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and landscape management objectives that drive the application of prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using geographic information system software, managers and biologists weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion were scored according to how they influence the need to burn. Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and reviewed through monitoring and public comment.",NA,NA,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2003.00381.x,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Bridging Decision-Making Process And Environmental Needs In Corridor Planning,"Purpose - The aim of this paper is to clarify the spatial multi-criteria workflow for stakeholders and decision makers, for which feedback rankings are vital to the success of the transportation planning. Design/methodology/approach - The experimental approach was designed to integrate in a novel fashion both analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) within a geospatial information system (GIS) framework to deliver visual and objective tabular results useful to estimate environmental costs of the alignments generated. The method enables ranking, prioritization, selection, and refinement of preferred alternatives. The Interstate-269, the newly planned bypass of Memphis-TN, for which a recent environmental impact study (EIS) was completed, was selected as the experiment test-bed. Findings - The results indicate that the approach can automate the delivery of feasible alignments that closely approximate those generated by traditional approaches. Furthermore, via integration of local planning and ancillary spatial data, the method provided alignment results that avoided areas where local opposition was noted in the EIS. This enhanced method based on remote sensing and spatial information technologies delivers low or high-predicted environmental costs per feature criteria and cumulative predicted costs while preserving local values and plans. Practical implications - The method is highly transferable and limited solely by the availability of sources of geospatial data and coordination with stakeholders. The approach was implemented to derive results similar to traditional approaches with benefits in time, costs, and quality of solutions. Originality/value - A novel adaptation of MCDM and AHD within a spatial decision-making framework is presented.

Regional Assessment Of Environmental Vulnerability In The Tibetan Plateau: Development And Application Of A New Method,"Regional environmental evaluation often requires a large amount of spatial information. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are capable of managing large amounts of spatially related datum, and providing the ability to integrate multiple layers and to derive additional information. A methodological reference framework, using RS, GIS, and AHP (the analytic hierarchy process), is developed for environmental vulnerability assessment. Using this proposed method, we carried out a case study in the Tibetan Plateau. An environmental vulnerability index (EVI) proposed incorporates 15 factors covering natural conditions, environmental issues, and human activities. According to the EVI values, the vulnerability was classified into five levels: slight (EVI < 2.2), light (2.2 <= EVI < 2.7), moderate (2.7 <= EVI < 3.0), heavy (3.0 <= EVI <= 3.4), and extreme vulnerability (> 3.4). The case study showed that the majority of the area in the Tibetan Plateau is ecologically lightly (light level; 22\% of the total area), moderately (moderate level; 27\%), and heavily (heavy level: 30\%) vulnerable. Except for a clearly horizontal distribution, the environmental vulnerability increased clearly with increasing elevation (vertical distribution). The case study verified the usefulness and feasibility of the methods developed, for the results gained reflect the reality of the Tibetan environment closely. Further use in other regions should pay attention to what factors seem to be important in determining the local environmental vulnerability, and how is the impact of each factor on the complex environment.

An Improved Method For Estimating Surface Fine Particle Concentrations Using Seasonally Adjusted Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth,"Using satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to estimate surface concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a well-established technique in the air quality community. In this study, the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations measured at five monitor locations in the Baltimore, MD/Washington, DC region and AOD from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) were calculated for the summer of 2004 and all of 2005. Linear regression methods were used to determine the direct quantitative relationships between the satellite AOD values and PM2.5 concentration measurements. Results show that correlations between AOD and surface PM2.5 concentrations range from 0.46 to 0.84 for the analyzed time period. Correlations with AOD from MODIS and MISR were higher than those from GOES, likely because of variations in the algorithms used by the different instruments. To determine the relative usefulness of platform- and season-specific AOD PM2.5 regression analysis, the results from this study were used to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations for two representative case studies. This analysis of case studies demonstrates that it is necessary to include season and satellite platform information for more accurate estimates of surface PM2.5 concentrations from satellite AOD data. Consequently, tools that currently use a constant relationship to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations from satellite AOD data, such as the Infusing satellite Data into Environmental Applications (IDEA) website, may need to be revised to include parameters that allow the relationships to vary with season and satellite platform to provide more accurate results.

Remote Delivery Of The Satellite Virtual Fracture Clinic - A Pilot Report Of The First 500 Cases,"Presenting to the fracture clinic carries economic, social and societal consequences. The virtual fracture clinic (VFC) has proven to be a safe, patient-focused, cost-effective means of delivering trauma care, whilst reducing unnecessary clinic attendances. Within our institution, a Satellite VFC was established, so as to accommodate an offsite referring emergency department. The VFC database was accessed to identify the first 500 patients who were referred to the Satellite VFC. The decision made for each patient, the rate of returns to the clinic, and the rate of referrals requiring surgical intervention, following discussion at the VFC, ,were identified. A cost analysis and cost comparison was carried out between the Satellite VFC and the traditional ""face to face"" fracture clinic. There were 500 patients referred to the Satellite VFC within the study period. Of such patients, 288 (58\%) were discharged directly following review at the Satellite VFC, 141 patients (28\%) were referred to physiotherapy, 50 (10\%) were redirected to the trauma clinic, 11 (2\%) were sent directly to hand therapy, and 10 (2\%) were sent to the ED review clinic. Patients who returned to the fracture clinic accounted for 3.8\% of all referrals, and 0.2\% of all referrals necessitated surgical intervention. This pilot initiative saved the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group over (sic)50,000. The Satellite VFC is the first of its kind in the literature. Rural communities worldwide would benefit from remote orthopaedic management of suitable fracture patterns. The true value of the Satellite VFC process comes from its use of robust patient care pathways, rationalising resource use and minimising patient travel, whilst demonstrating reliable outcomes and promoting safety.

Road Identification Algorithm For Remote Sensing Images Based On Wavelet Transform And Recursive Operator,"Road edge detection from remote sensing images, as an important ground object type, plays an important role in people's life and travel and urban planning and development, and extracting road information from remote sensing images has practical scientific value and practical significance. However, with the development of remote sensing technology, while the resolution of remote sensing images is improved, the information describing ground objects becomes more and more abundant, and the difficulty of identifying and extracting road information is also increased. In the process of acquiring remote sensing images, the actual system is subjected to various kinds of noise interference. Different environmental interference and system defects will introduce noises with completely different distribution and statistical characteristics to remote sensing images. Aiming at the problem that the detection effect of traditional algorithms becomes worse due to the influence of noise on remote sensing images, a wavelet transform denoising method and morphological gradient operator are proposed. By selecting appropriate structural elements of remote sensing images, noise pixels cannot participate in morphological calculation, and the noise intensity changes with the size of quantum superposition state structural elements. Therefore, a morphological gradient operator is established and applied to edge detection of remote sensing images. Finally, the experimental results show that the method proposed in this article is better than other directions in terms of effect through road edge detection and matching. This method can effectively reduce noise.

In recent years, political agendas worldwide have recognized the importance of forests' cultural ecosystem services, such as recreation. However, the inclusion of such values in management plans is challenging, and forest managers require novel methodologies and indicators to characterize forest recreation demand and provision. To this end, in this study, we combine remote sensing technologies and crowdsourced social media data to map and value the forest recreational potential of BC's provincial parks system. We trained and deployed convolutional neural networks to automatically classify the content of over 60,000 Flickr images, we then created a random forest model to identify the variables that influence the visitors' choice of recreational activity. These models allowed us to map the most likely recreational activities to occur in BC's provincial parks and perform a spatially explicit assessment of the consumer surplus that these activities generate with a benefit transfer approach. Our findings suggest that the most influential variables in determining the choice of forest recreational activities are topo-graphic, while anthropogenic impacts and forest biometrics variables have less effect. Furthermore, the outcomes of our study support the proposition that the integration of social media and remote sensing technologies allow, in the future, park managers to tailor the management of recreational services to forest visitors' needs.",NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110165,{},excluded,"{""Data is not valued""}"
Adaptive Probabilistic Harmony Search For Binary Optimization Problems,"Harmony search (HS) is an optimization technique that uses several operators such as pitch adjustments to provide local improvement to candidate solutions during the optimization process. A standard pitch adjustment operator is known to be inefficient for binary domain optimization problems. A novel adaptive probabilistic harmony search (APHS) algorithm for binary optimization problems is proposed in this paper. APHS combines the power of the standard harmony search with the modelling capability of probabilistic search algorithms, with almost no extra user-tuned parameters. In APHS, the expected value of the search probability distribution is adapted using a sample of âgoodâ vectors among the population to minimize the cross entropy between the actual distribution and the measured one. Moreover, Bernoulli probability distribution was used to enhance the pitch adjustment operator to fit the binary optimization domain. The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm are shown by a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art existing techniques in a number of binary space optimization problems with variant complexities and sizes. The set of binary space optimization problems investigated in this paper include: Max-One problem, Order-3 deceptive problem, Bipolar Order-6 deceptive problem, Muehlenbeinâs Order-5 problem, Knapsack problem, Multi-Knapsack problem, and finally a real-world problem of the satellite broadcast scheduling. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is indeed very effective and outperforms the existing algorithms by finding optimal solutions for almost all tested benchmarks.

Online Dynamic Working-State Recognition Through Uncertain Data Classification,"The satellite must continue working properly under different working environments and working loads. The power system is an essential component. Due to different working tasks, loads, and attitudes, a power system has many diverse working states. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately recognize the working state online for fault diagnostics and health management. However, under different working loads, measurement errors, environmental noise, environmental interference, and other uncertain factors, the output voltage value of a satellite power system has different levels of uncertainties. If these uncertainties and various working states are not considered, the recognition results can be of low quality. To address this problem and the uncertainty factors, we present an online dynamic working-state recognition system for satellite power systems based on uncertain data classification. In the system, we first explore the uncertain-data clustering center to model the working state. Then, with a slide-window processing strategy, we compute the distances between the uncertain cluster centers and the uncertain voltage data for the satellite power system online. Thus, we can obtain more accurate dynamic working-state recognition results. The evaluation results of real data demonstrate that the presented system is valid for working-state recognition and can be applied to a satellite power system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Applications Of Remote Sensing Retrieval Of Evapotranspiration In Irrigation Water Management: A Review,"High-efficient usage of irrigation water resources is essential to ensure agricultural production and sustainable utilization of water resources. Climate warming and rapid socio-economic development pose great challenges to the sustainable use of irrigation water resources. Current agricultural production tends to be more intensive, standardized and informationized, resulting in higher requirements for the development of efficient water-saving irrigation and the realization of precision management of irrigation water use. Evapotranspiration can reflect the exchanges of water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere and water consumption by crops, thus playing a key role in irrigation water management. Over the past two decades, with the development of Earth observation technologies, theories and methods of remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration and data fusion are becoming mature, resulting in continuously improving spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of evapotranspiration estimates. This trend has greatly maximized the application potential of remotely based evapotranspiration in the field of irrigation water resources. First, this review summarizes the advances of remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration and data fusion and related widely used datasets. Applications of evapotranspiration in irrigation water use monitoring, irrigation schedule optimization, and evaluation of irrigation benefits are systematically summarized. This review could provide reference for efficient utilization and precise management of agricultural water resources. Â© 2023 China Water Power Press.

The mean absolute percentage errors of particle swarm optimization-fuzzy support vector machines, grey particle swarm optimization neural network model, particle swarm optimization neural network model and grey model are calculated. The result shows that the model of particle swarm optimization-fuzzy support vector machines is most accurate and more efficient in prognosis. It has broad application prospects in the field of prognosis of spacecraft parameters. Â©, 2014, China Spaceflight Society.
