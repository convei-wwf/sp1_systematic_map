Through a case study of the observance of sea turtle light ordinances in Florida, this study seeks to demonstrate that remotely sensed data can be beneficial in evaluation of environmental policy compliance. As a means to increase the successful sea turtle nesting rate, 21 counties and several other municipalities adapted policies prohibiting the lighting of beaches during sea turtle nesting season from May to October. Using visible/infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights satellite imagery to determine mean radiance values and diamond plots of difference images of nighttime lights radiance values, this study confirms compliance with these light ordinances while emphasizing the benefits of remote sensing techniques in the process.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Coral reef management and conservation stand to benefit from improved high-resolution global mapping. Yet classifications underpinning large-scale reef mapping to date are typically poorly defined, not shared or region-specific, limiting end-users' ability to interpret outputs. Here we present               Reef Cover               , a coral reef geomorphic zone classification, developed to support both producers and end-users of global-scale coral reef habitat maps, in a transparent and version-based framework. Scalable classes were created by focusing on attributes that can be observed remotely, but whose membership rules also reflect deep knowledge of reef form and functioning. Bridging the divide between earth observation data and geo-ecological knowledge of reefs,               Reef Cover               maximises the trade-off between applicability at global scales, and relevance and accuracy at local scales. Two case studies demonstrate application of the               Reef Cover               classification scheme and its scientific and conservation benefits: 1) detailed mapping of the               Cairns Management Region               of the Great Barrier Reef to support management and 2) mapping of the Caroline and Mariana Island chains in the Pacific for conservation purposes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             An estimated 65\% of the world's land and more than 80\% of Earth's biodiversity are under indigenous or local community customary ownership, care, and use. Recent developments in remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), mobile, and cloud computing provide the opportunity to systematically and cost-effectively monitor land-cover and land-use changes and threats at multiple scales. It is now possible, via satellite observations, to obtain a synoptic view of ecosystems at spatial and temporal resolutions that are more detailed, locally relevant, and consistent from village to global scales. However, to make geospatial data and technologies work for conservation, we still need to understand how data turn into actionable information and conservation decisions. This chapter uses Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation as a framework to discuss insights from 18 years of using geospatial technologies with the local communities, village and district governments, and other partners to monitor chimpanzee habitats and threats and inform chimpanzee conservation strategies and actions in Tanzania. It focuses on how Earth Observation data and associated technologies enabled and benefitted from the creation of research-implementation spaces in which stakeholders were able to collaborate and interact with geospatial data and results in a diversity of ways. This enabled development of geospatial applications and solutions `with' and not `for' local stakeholders, resulting in expansion of new protected areas managed by village and districts governments and restoration of habitats in some degraded village forest reserves.},
